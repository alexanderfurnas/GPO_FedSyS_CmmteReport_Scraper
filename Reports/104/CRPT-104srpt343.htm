     VI. MEASURES NOT REFERRED TO SUBCOMMITTEES THAT WERE ACTIVELY 
                               CONSIDERED

           The Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act of 1993

    On September 23, 1993, Senator Biden, chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced S. 1488, the Violent 
Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1993. The major crime 
initiative included: constitutional procedures for the 
imposition of the death penalty, habeas corpus reform, $7 
billion for 50,000 cops for community policing, $1.2 billion 
for drug courts, boot camps and regional prisons. On November 
1, 1993, Chairman Biden introduced a revised version of this 
bill, S. 1607, that included an additional $2 million to 
community policing.
    The Senate debated S. 1607 from November 3, 1993, to 
November 18, 1993. One of the most important amendments adopted 
was the Byrd amendment, which added a $22.3 billion Violent 
Crime Reduction Trust Fund, providing 100,000 cops for 
community policing initiatives, $9.7 billion for prisons and 
boot camps, and $1.6 billion for the Violence Against Women 
Act. The Trust Fund was paid for by the savings realized from 
implementing reductions in Federal employees, so that the crime 
bill could be funded without adding to the budget deficit.
    On November 19, 1993, the Senate passed the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1993. It included: a $8.9 
billion for 100,000 cops performing community policy, a ban on 
military-style assault weapons; 50 death penalties; $1.6 
billion for the Violence Against Women Act, increased penalties 
for several crimes, including a ``three strikes'' provision; 
$6.5 billion in prisons; $1.2 billion for Drug Courts, and $3.7 
billion in crime prevention programs targeting children and 
drug treatment.
    From November to December 1993, the House of 
Representatives passed several bills including the Violence 
Against Women Act, the Youth Handgun Safety Act, Community 
Policing, the National Child Protection Act, Juvenile Gang 
Participation and Juvenile Drug Trafficking Grants, Residential 
Substance Abuse Treatment Programs and the Jacob Wetterling 
Crimes Against Children Registration Act.
    On March 18, 1994, the House of Representatives introduced 
H.R. 4092, a $28 billion bill which included $3.4 billion for 
50,000 cops, $6.8 billion for prevention, $14 billion in 
prisons, expanded Federal death penalties, and the Racial 
Justice Act. The omnibus crime bill was passed on April 21, 
1994. On May 5, 1994, the House passed the assault weapons ban.
    From July 26 to 28, 1994, the House and Senate conferees 
met to resolve differences between crime legislation. The 
conference report (103-389) failed in the House on August 11, 
1994. The conferees met again on August 21, 1994, and reported 
a second conference report (103-711). The second conference 
report passed the House on August 21, 1994 (235-195). The 
Senate debated the report from the 22d to the 25th of August. 
On August 25, 1994, H.R. 3355 passed the Senate (61-38). On 
September 13, 1994, President Clinton signed the act into law 
(Public Law 103-322).

                 The Violence Against Women Act of 1993

    On January 21, 1993, Senator Biden, chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, introduced S. 11, the Violence Against 
Women Act of 1993--a bill to combat crimes against women on the 
streets and in homes. Senate bill 11 included new criminal 
offenses for interstate spouse abuse, funding for education, 
prevention and more effective law enforcement included 
increased penalties for sex crimes, and mandatory restitution 
and a new civil rights remedy for crimes motivated by the 
victim's gender.
    The full committee held six hearings on the Violence 
Against Women Act in the 103d Congress. Three were held in 
Washington: ``Anti-Stalking Proposals: Combating Stalking and 
Family Violence'' (March 17, 1993), ``The Response to Rap: 
Detours on the Road to Equal Justice'' (May 27, 1993), and 
``Turning the Act into Action: the Violence Against Women Act'' 
(September 29, 1994). Three field hearings were held on 
domestic violence, one in South Portland, Maine (November 12, 
1993), one in Salt Lake City, Utah (April 13, 1993) and one in 
Boston, Massachusettes (February 1, 1993).
    The full committee markup occurred on May 27, 1993, and the 
committee filed a report on September 10, 1993 (S. Report. 103-
138). The bill was approved by the committee and ordered 
favorably reported on May 27, 1993, with an amendment in the 
nature of substitute (S. Report. No. 103-138). The Violence 
Against Women Act passed the full Senate as part of the Violent 
Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1993, S. 1607; which 
was signed into law by President Clinton on September 14, 1994.

              Oversight of National Drug Control Strategy

    On May 25, 1993, the Judiciary Committee conducted a 
confirmation hearing on the nomination of Dr. Lee Patrick Brown 
to be the Director of the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy. The committee held five oversight hearings, addressing 
all aspects of the national drug strategy including ``Breaking 
the Cycle of Drug Abuse'' (October 20, 1993), the nomination of 
Thomas A. Constantine to be Director of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (March 2, 1994), ``Medicines for Drug Abuse'' 
(April 19, 1994), and ``Combating Drugs in America: Putting the 
Drug Strategy into Action'' (October 5, 1994).
    Chairman Biden released several national drug strategies: 
On April 1993, the chairman released ``America's Drug Strategy: 
Lessons of the Past * * * Steps Toward the Future.'' In 
February 1994, the chairman released ``America's Drug Strategy: 
Prescription for Action'' and ``U.S. International Drug Policy: 
Recent Experience, Future Options.'' On October 5, 1994, 
Senator Biden released ``Combating Drugs in America: Putting 
the Drug Strategy into Action.''

                     National Child Protection Act

    On November 20, 1993, Senator Biden, chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee, introduced S. 1759, the National Child 
Protection Act of 1993, to establish a national background 
check procedure to ensure that persons working as child care 
providers do not have a criminal history of child abuse. The 
act initiated the reporting of all State and Federal child 
abuse crimes, imposed minimum guidelines for States to follow 
in conducting background checks, and provided protection from 
inaccurate information. The House passed the act as a separate 
bill, H.R. 1237. It was received and debated in the Senate on 
November 20, 1993. The Senate passed H.R. 1237 by unaminous 
consent in lieu of S. 1759 on November 20, 1993. The act was 
signed into law (Public Law 103-209) by President Clinton on 
December 20, 1993.

                    Rural Crime and Drug Control Act

    Senator Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
included in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1993 a rural crime provision, S. 1607. It authorized $240 
million dollars in aid to rural law enforcement agencies 
including rural crime and drug enforcement task forces, rural 
drug enforcement training and more agents of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration. It was signed into law on September 
13, 1994, as part of the violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act of 1994.

                  Joint Production, S. 574 (H.R. 1313)

    Senator Biden joined Senators Thurmond and Leahy as an 
original cosponsor of S. 574, the National Cooperative 
Production Amendments Act of 1993 (the Joint Production Bill), 
introduced on March 11, 1993. Senate bill 574 passed the 
Committee on March 25, 1993 (S. Rept. 103-51). The House 
version of the Joint Production Bill, H.R. 1313, passed the 
Senate on May 28, 1993, and was enacted into law on June 10, 
1993 (Public Law 103-42). Passage of the Joint Production Bill 
ended more than 4 years of effort on the part of Senators 
Leahy, Biden, and Thurmond. The House and Senate bills were 
substantively the same.

              The Judicial Amendments Act of 1994, S. 2407

    Senator Biden cosponsored S. 2407 along with Senators 
Heflin, Hatch, and Grassley. The bill was introduced, held at 
the desk and passed by unanimous consent on August 18, 1994. 
Senate bill 2407 passed the House by unanimous consent on 
October 7, 1994, and was signed into law on October 25, 1994 
(Public Law 103-420).
    Senator Biden's primary interest related to section 4 of S. 
2407 which extended for 1 year the RAND study of the pilot 
courts set up under the CJRA. Senator Biden also supported the 
bill's provisions to reauthorize both the judiciary automation 
fund and the court-annexed arbitration program for an 
additional 3 years.

Metzenbaum and Strom Thurmond and was referred to the Judiciary 
Committee. The legislation enhances the ability of the Attorney 
General and the Federal Trade Commission to obtain antitrust 
evidence located abroad for use in U.S. Government antitrust 
investigations and prosecutions. The Attorney General and the 
Federal Trade Commission are also authorized to conduct 
investigations on behalf of, and to provide antitrust evidence 
to, foreign antitrust authorities on a reciprocal basis, 
pursuant to antitrust mutual assistance agreements. S. 2297 was 
reported by the Judiciary Committee on August 11, 1994. The 
committee report was filed on September 12, 1994 (S. Rpt. 103-
388). The bill was passed by the Senate on October 7, 1994. On 
October 8, 1994, the Senate substituted H.R. 4781 for S. 2297 
(H.R. 4781, which had passed the House on October 3, 1994, was 
identical to S. 2297, as amended and passed by the Senate) and 
enacted that bill by voice vote. The bill was signed into law 
on November 2, 1994.

American Legion Auxiliary, the Sons of the American Legion, and 
the United Daughters of the Confederacy. S. 409 as introduced 
was polled out of the subcommittee on March 22, 1993, without 
dissent. On May 6, 1993, the Judiciary Committee discussed S. 
409, at which time Senator Moseley-Braun offered a substitute 
amendment to delete the extension of the United Daughters of 
the Confederacy design patent, which passed by a rollcall vote 
of 12 to 3. The bill was then favorably reported as amended (S. 
Rpt. 103-64). The full Senate passed S. 409 as amended on July 
14, 1993. The provisions of S. 409, as passed by the Senate, 
were included in H.R. 2632, legislation to authorize 
appropriations for the Patent and Trademark Office in the 
Department of Commerce for fiscal year 1994. H.R. 2632 passed

the Judiciary Committee ordered the modified DeConcini 
substitute amendment to S. 1485 favorably reported to the full 
Senate (S. Rpt. 103-407) on May 5, 1994. The modified DeConcini 
substitute to S. 1485 passed the Senate by voice vote on May 
18, 1994. The House amended and passed S. 1485 by voice vote on 
August 16, 1994. The House and Senate ironed out their

2406 which passed the House on September 20, 1994, and passed 
the Senate on October 4, 1994.

    S. 41, introduced by Senator Thurmond on January 21, 1993, 
grants an extension of the patent for an additional 14 years to 
the United Daughters of the Confederacy. This bill became a 
provision of S. 409, but was deleted by the Moseley-Braun 
amendment during full committee consideration of S. 409 on May 
6, 1993. The rollcall vote in committee to delete the patent 
extension of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was 12 to 
3. (This legislation was also considered on the Senate floor as 
an amendment by Senator Helms to another bill and failed by a 
vote of 75 to 25.)

    During the 103d Congress, three Senate bills were referred 
to the Subcommittee on Technology and the Law.
    A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to authorize 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain telephone 
subscriber information, H.R. 175, was signed into law (Public

    During the 103d Congress, the subcommittee held legislative 
hearings on the following matters:

    (1) The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
of 1993, S. 2375.
    (2) High-tech privacy issues in medical care that 
culminated in S. 2129, which was included in bills reported by 
the Committees on Labor and Human Resources and Finance.

    The subcommittee continued ongoing oversight of the 
Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Freedom of 
Information Act.

                     IV. Measures Enacted Into Law

  1. communications assistance for law enforcement act (s. 2375/h.r. 
                       4922, public law 103-414)

    Senator Leahy was the principal sponsor of the measure, 
which was later cosponsored by Senators Hatch and Biden. 
Representative Don Edwards sponsored companion legislation 
(H.R. 2375) in the House. On March 18, 1994, and August 11, 
1994, Senator Leahy and Representative Edwards chaired two 
joint hearings on this issue.
    The bill was polled out of the Technology Subcommittee and 
then voted unanimously out of the full Judiciary Committee 
unanimously on September 28, 1994.
    The act establishes requirements for telecommunications 
carriers to meet to ensure that court-ordered wiretaps can be 
executed. Director Freeh of the FBI had termed this matter the 
Nation's number one law enforcement, public safety, and 
national security priority issue.
    The Senate Report filed with the bill, S. Rept. 103-402, 
explains that this legislation builds on the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) sponsored by Senator Leahy in 
1986, and the recommendations of Senator Leahy's Privacy and 
Technology Task Force in 1991. Specifically, the act expands 
the privacy protection of ECPA to cover cordless phones and 
certain radio-based communications, prohibits the fraudulent 
alteration of cellular phones, and improves privacy protection 
for transactional data over phones and electronic communication 
services.

         2. computer abuse amendments act (public law 103-322)

    The Computer Abuse Amendments Act, which had been 
introduced in the 102d Congress as S. 1322 and approved by the 
subcommittee and full Judiciary Committee in that Congress, was 
included in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
as section 290001. This legislation, which was passed by the 
Senate on August 25, 1994, and signed by the President on 
September 13, 1994, makes it a felony intentionally to cause 
harm to a computer or the information stored in it by 
transmitting a computer program or code (including destructive 
computer viruses) in interstate commerce without authorization 
and provides a civil cause of action for damages.

                 V. Other Measures Actively Considered

                   1. electronic foia improvement act

    Senators Leahy and Brown introduced the Electronic Freedom

1992, in the 102d Congress. A revised version of S. 1782 was 
unanimously polled out of the subcommittee on June 29, 1994, 
and favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee on August 11, 
1994. The report on the bill is S. Rept. 103-365. The bill 
passed the Senate on August 25, 1994.
    This bill would expand public access to Government records 
in electronic form and would encourage records management 
practices intended to reduce delays in Federal agency responses 
to FOIA requests. It improves upon prior versions by deleting 
controversial punitive monetary penalties against agencies for 
delays, doubling the time limit from 10 to 20 days for initial 
determinations of FOIA requests, providing guidelines for 
expedited access, and increasing requirements for on-line 
access to Government records.

    The subcommittee held hearings in October 27, 1993, and 
January 27, 1994, on high-tech privacy issues in health care 
(Hearing Serial No. J-103-34). Senator Leahy introduced the
