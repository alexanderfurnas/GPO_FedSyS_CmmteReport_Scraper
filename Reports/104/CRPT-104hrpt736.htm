                renewed.

the time of coverage renewal, a health insurance issuer may 
modify the health insurance coverage for a policy form offered 
to individuals in the individual market so long as such 
modification is consistent with State law and effective on a 
uniform basis among all individuals with that policy form.
    ``(e) Application to Coverage Offered Only Through 
Associations.--In applying this section in the case of health 
insurance coverage that is made available by a health insurance 
issuer in the individual market to individuals only through one 
or more associations, a reference to an `individual' is deemed 
to include a reference to such an association (of which the

implementing, or continuing in effect standards and 
requirements unless such standards and requirements prevent the 
application of a requirement of this part.
    ``(b) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this part (or part 
C insofar as it applies to this part) shall be construed to

section 2791(c) if the benefits are provided under a separate 
policy, certificate, or contract of insurance.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in this 
        subsection, part B of title XXVII of the Public Health

        sold, issued, renewed, in effect, or operated in the 
        individual market after June 30, 1997, regardless of 
        when a period of creditable coverage occurs.

        provisions of section 102(d)(2) of this Act shall apply 
        to section 2743 of the Public Health Service Act in the 
        same manner as it applies to section 2701(e) of such

        shall provide for a study on--
                    (A) the extent to which patients have

                providers, including specialty providers, 
                within a network plan, as well as the

                out-of-network providers, and the potential 
                impact of providing such access on the cost and

                    CLINICS.

    Section 224 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
233) is amended by adding at the end the following subsection:
    ``(o)(1) For purposes of this section, a free clinic health 
professional shall in providing a qualifying health service to 
an individual be deemed to be an employee of the Public Health 
Service for a calendar year that begins during a fiscal year 
for which a transfer was made under paragraph (6)(D). The 
preceding sentence is subject to the provisions of this 
subsection.
    ``(2) In providing a health service to an individual, a 
health care practitioner shall for purposes of this subsection 
be considered to be a free clinic health professional if the 
following conditions are met:
            ``(A) The service is provided to the individual at 
        a free clinic, or through offsite programs or events 
        carried out by the free clinic.

        from the individual or from any third-party payor 
        (including reimbursement under any insurance policy or 
        health plan, or under any Federal or State health 
        benefits program). With respect to compliance with such 
        condition:
                    ``(i) The health care practitioner may 
                receive repayment from the free clinic for 
                reasonable expenses incurred by the health care 
                practitioner in the provision of the service to 
                the individual.

                donations for the provision of the service by

        care practitioner or the free clinic provides written 
        notice to the individual of the extent to which the 
        legal liability of the health care practitioner is 
        limited pursuant to this subsection (or in the case of 
        an emergency, the written notice is provided to the 
        individual as soon after the emergency as is 
        practicable). If the individual is a minor or is 
        otherwise legally incompetent, the condition under this 
        subparagraph is that the written notice be provided to 
        a legal guardian or other person with legal 
        responsibility for the care of the individual.
            ``(F) At the time the service is provided, the 
        health care practitioner is licensed or certified in 
        accordance with applicable law regarding the provision 
        of the service.
    ``(3)(A) For purposes of this subsection, the term `free 
clinic' means a health care facility operated by a nonprofit 
private entity meeting the following requirements:
            ``(i) The entity does not, in providing health 
        services through the facility, accept reimbursement 
        from any third-party payor (including reimbursement 
        under any insurance policy or health plan, or under any 
        Federal or State health benefits program).
            ``(ii) The entity, in providing health services 
        through the facility, either does not impose charges on 
        the individuals to whom the services are provided, or 
        imposes a charge according to the ability of the 
        individual involved to pay the charge.
            ``(iii) The entity is licensed or certified in 
        accordance with applicable law regarding the provision 
        of health services.
    ``(B) With respect to compliance with the conditions under 
subparagraph (A), the entity involved may accept voluntary 
donations for the provision of services.
    ``(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term `qualifying 
health service' means any medical assistance required or 
authorized to be provided in the program under title XIX of the 
Social Security Act, without regard to whether the medical 
assistance is included in the plan submitted under such program 
by the State in which the health care practitioner involved 
provides the medical assistance. References in the preceding 
sentence to such program shall as applicable be considered to 
be references to any successor to such program.
    ``(5) Subsection (g) (other than paragraphs (3) through 
(5)) and subsections (h), (i), and (l) apply to a health care 
practitioner for purposes of this subsection to the same extent 
and in the same manner as such subsections apply to an officer, 
governing board member, employee, or contractor of an entity 
described in subsection (g)(4), subject to paragraph (6) and 
subject to the following:

        Health Service for purposes of this section.
            ``(C) With respect to a free clinic, a health care 
        practitioner is not a free clinic health professional 
        unless the free clinic sponsors the health care 
        practitioner. For purposes of this subsection, the free 
        clinic shall be considered to be sponsoring the health 
        care practitioner if--

                employee of the Public Health Service.
            ``(D) In the case of a health care practitioner who 
        is determined by the Secretary pursuant to subsection 
        (g)(1)(E) to be a free clinic health professional, this 
        subsection applies to the health care practitioner 
        (with respect to the free clinic sponsoring the health 
        care practitioner pursuant to subparagraph C)) for any 
        cause of action arising from an act or omission of the 
        health care practitioner occurring on or after the date 
        on which the Secretary makes such determination.
            ``(E) Subsection (g)(1)(F) applies to a health care 
        practitioner for purposes of this subsection only to 
        the extent that, in providing health services to an 
        individual, each of the conditions specified in 
        paragraph (2) is met.
    ``(6)(A) For purposes of making payments for judgments 
against the United States (together with related fees and 
expenses of witnesses) pursuant to this section arising from 
the acts or omissions of free clinic health professionals, 
there is authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 for each 
fiscal year.
    ``(B) The Secretary shall establish a fund for purposes of 
this subsection. Each fiscal year amounts appropriated under 
subparagraph (A) shall be deposited in such fund.
    ``(C) Not later than May 1 of each fiscal year, the 
Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, shall 
submit to the Congress a report providing an estimate of the 
amount of claims (together with related fees and expenses of 
witnesses) that, by reason of the acts or omissions of free 
clinic health professionals, will be paid pursuant to this 
section during the calendar year that begins in the following 
fiscal year. Subsection (k)(1)(B) applies to the estimate under 
the preceding sentence regarding free clinic health 
professionals to the same extent and in the same manner as such 
subsection applies to the estimate under such subsection 
regarding officers, governing board members, employees, and 
contractors of entities described in subsection (g)(4).
    ``(D) Not later than December 31 of each fiscal year, the 
Secretary shall transfer from the fund under subparagraph (B)

under subparagraph (D) of such paragraph shall be made 
notwithstanding the lack of the estimate, and the transfer 
shall be made in an amount equal to the amount of such

SEC. 195. FINDINGS; SEVERABILITY.

    (a) Findings Relating to Exercise of Commerce Clause 
Authority.--Congress finds the following in relation to the 
provisions of this title:
            (1) Provisions in group health plans and health 
        insurance coverage that impose certain preexisting 
        condition exclusions impact the ability of employees to 
        seek employment in interstate commerce, thereby 
        impeding such commerce.
            (2) Health insurance coverage is commercial in 
        nature and is in and affects interstate commerce.
            (3) It is a necessary and proper exercise of 
        Congressional authority to impose requirements under 
        this title on group health plans and health insurance 
        coverage (including coverage offered to individuals 
        previously covered under group health plans) in order 
        to promote commerce among the States.
            (4) Congress, however, intends to defer to States, 
        to the maximum extent practicable, in carrying out such 
        requirements with respect to insurers and health 
        maintenance organizations that are subject to State 
        regulation, consistent with the provisions of the 
        Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
    (b) Severability.--If any provision of this title or the 
application of such provision to any person or circumstance is 
held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this title and 
the application of the provisions of such to any person or 
circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

        the Social Security Act, or who have otherwise engaged 
        in fraud and abuse against the medicare program under

        imposition of such a sanction.
            (2) Payment of portion of amounts collected.--If an 
        individual reports information to the Secretary under

        individual submits a suggestion to the Secretary under 
        the program established under paragraph (1) which is 
        adopted by the Secretary and which results in savings 
        to the program, the Secretary may make a payment to the 
        individual of such amount as the Secretary considers 
        appropriate.

   Subtitle G--Duplication and Coordination of Medicare-Related Plans

SEC. 271. DUPLICATION AND COORDINATION OF MEDICARE-RELATED PLANS.

    (a) Treatment of Certain Health Insurance Policies as 
Nonduplicative.--Section 1882(d)(3)(A) (42 U.S.C. 
1395ss(d)(3)(A)) is amended--
            (1) in clause (iii), by striking ``clause (i)'' and 
        inserting ``clause (i)(II)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, a health 
insurance policy (other than a medicare supplemental policy) 
providing for benefits which are payable to or on behalf of an 
individual without regard to other health benefit coverage of 
such individual is not considered to `duplicate' any health 
benefits under this title, under title XIX, or under a health 
insurance policy, and subclauses (I) and (III) of clause (i) do 
not apply to such a policy.
    ``(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, a health insurance 
policy (or a rider to an insurance contract which is not a 
health insurance policy) is not considered to `duplicate' 
health benefits under this title or under another health 
insurance policy if it--
            ``(I) provides health care benefits only for long-
        term care, nursing home care, home health care, or 
        community-based care, or any combination thereof,

        services available or paid for under this title or 
        under another health insurance policy, and
            ``(III) for policies sold or issued on or after the 
        end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of 
        enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and 
        Accountability Act of 1996) discloses such coordination 
        or exclusion in the policy's outline of coverage.
For purposes of this clause, the terms `coordinates' and 
`coordination' mean, with respect to a policy in relation to 
health benefits under this title or under another health 
insurance policy, that the policy under its terms is secondary 
to, or excludes from payment, items and services to the extent 
available or paid for under this title or under another health 
insurance policy.
    ``(vi)(I) An individual entitled to benefits under part A 
or enrolled under part B of this title who is applying for a 
health insurance policy (other than a policy described in 
subclause (III)) shall be furnished a disclosure statement 
described in clause (vii) for the type of policy being applied 
for. Such statement shall be furnished as a part of (or 
together with) the application for such policy.
    ``(II) Whoever issues or sells a health insurance policy 
(other than a policy described in subclause (III)) to an 
individual described in subclause (I) and fails to furnish the 
appropriate disclosure statement as required under such 
subclause shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or 
imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, and, in addition to 
or in lieu of such a criminal penalty, is subject to a civil 
money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case 
of a person other than the issuer of the policy) for each such 
violation.
    ``(III) A policy described in this subclause (to which 
subclauses (I) and (II) do not apply) is a medicare 
supplemental policy or a health insurance policy identified 
under 60 Federal Register 30880 (June 12, 1995) as a policy not 
required to have a disclosure statement.
    ``(IV) Any reference in this section to the revised NAIC 
model regulation (referred to in subsection (m)(1)(A)) is 
deemed a reference to such regulation as revised by section 
171(m)(2) of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994 (Public 
Law 103-432) and as modified by substituting, for the 
disclosure required under section 16D(2), disclosure under 
subclause (I) of an appropriate disclosure statement under 
clause (vii).
    ``(vii) The disclosure statement described in this clause 
for a type of policy is the statement specified under 
subparagraph (D) of this paragraph (as in effect before the 
date of the enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996) for that type of policy, as revised 
as follows:
            ``(I) In each statement, amend the second line to 
        read as follows:

              `THIS IS NOT MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE'.

        insert the following: `Some health care services paid 
        for by Medicare may also trigger the payment of 
        benefits under this policy.'.
            ``(III) In each statement not described in 
        subclause (V), strike the boldface matter that begins 
        `This insurance' and all that follows up to the next 
        paragraph that begins `Medicare'.
            ``(IV) In each statement not described in subclause 
        (V), insert before the boxed matter (that states 
        `Before You Buy This Insurance') the following: `This 
        policy must pay benefits without regard to other health 
        benefit coverage to which you may be entitled under 
        Medicare or other insurance.'.
            ``(V) In a statement relating to policies providing 
        both nursing home and non-institutional coverage, to 
        policies providing nursing home benefits only, or 
        policies providing home care benefits only, amend the 
        sentence that begins `Federal law' to read as follows: 
        `Federal law requires us to inform you that in certain 
        situations this insurance may pay for some care also 
        covered by Medicare.'.
    ``(viii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), nothing in this 
subparagraph shall restrict or preclude a State's ability to 
regulate health insurance policies, including any health 
insurance policy that is described in clause (iv), (v), or 
(vi)(III).
    ``(II) A State may not declare or specify, in statute, 
regulation, or otherwise, that a health insurance policy (other 
than a medicare supplemental policy) or rider to an insurance 
contract which is not a health insurance policy, that is 
described in clause (iv), (v), or (vi)(III) and that is sold, 
issued, or renewed to an individual entitled to benefits under 
part A or enrolled under part B `duplicates' health benefits 
under this title or under a medicare supplemental policy.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 1882(d)(3) (42 U.S.C. 
1395ss(d)(3)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (C)--
                    (A) by striking ``with respect to (i)'' and 
                inserting ``with respect to'', and
                    (B) by striking ``, (ii) the sale'' and all 
                that follows up to the period at the end; and
            (2) by striking subparagraph (D).
    (c) Transitional Provision.--
            (1) No penalties.--Subject to paragraph (3), no 
        criminal or civil money penalty may be imposed under 
        section 1882(d)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act for

                to conform any other long-term care rider to be 
                so treated,

        contracts.--The amount of per diem payments made under 
        a contract issued on or before July 31, 1996, with

    (a) In General.--Paragraph (5) of section 1215(c) of the

        year beginning after December 31, 1995, the pre-

        year as the number of days during such taxable year 
        before the date of the enactment of this Act bears to 
        366.

       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3103) to amend 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve portability and 
continuity of health insurance coverage in the group and 
individual markets, to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in health 
insurance and health care delivery, to promote the use of 
medical savings accounts, to improve access to long-term care 
services and coverage, to simplify the administration of health 
insurance, and for other purposes, submit the following joint 
statement to the House and the Senate in explanation of the 
effect of the action agreed upon by the managers and 
recommended in the accompanying conference report:
      The Senate amendment struck all of the House bill after 
the enacting clause and inserted a substitute text.
      The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the Senate with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
House bill and the Senate amendment. The differences between 
the House bill, the Senate amendment, and the substitute agreed 
to in conference are noted below, except for clerical 
corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements 
reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clerical 
changes.

      TITLE I.--HEALTH CARE ACCESS, PORTABILITY, AND RENEWABILITY

                              I. Structure

House bill
      The House bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code 
(IRC) and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(ERISA), and includes free-standing provisions.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment includes free-standing provisions.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement adds new provisions to the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the 
Public Health Services (PHS) Act, and the Internal Revenue Code 
(IRC).

         II. Availability and Portability of Group Health Plans

Current law
      Current federal law does not impose any requirements on 
employers to provide or contribute toward the health insurance 
coverage of their employees or their employees' dependents. 
However, specific federal requirements do apply to existing 
employer-sponsored health plans (e.g., fiduciary, notification 
and disclosure requirements under ERISA and COBRA continuation 
coverage, non-discrimination requirements under ERISA and the 
Internal Revenue Code.)
House bill
      The House bill would provide for federal requirements on 
group health plans (and insurers and health maintenance 
organizations (HMOs) selling to such plans) relating to 
portability, the use of preexisting medical condition, and 
discrimination based on health status.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment would provide for federal 
requirements on group health plans, health plan issuers 
(entities licensed by the state to offer a group or individual 
health plan) and employee health benefit plans, relating to 
portability, the use of preexisting medical conditions, and 
discrimination based on health status.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides for federal 
requirements on group health plans and health insurance issuers 
offering group health insurance coverage relating to 
portability, access, and renewability.

                             a. definitions

      (Also see item IX below.)
Current law
      Section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 
defines a group health plan as a plan (including a self-insured 
plan) of, or contributed to by, an employer (including a self-
employed person) or employee organization to provide health 
care (directly or otherwise) to the employees, former 
employees, the employer, others associated or formerly 
associated with the employer in a business relationship, or 
their families.
      Section 607(1) of ERISA defines a group health plan as an 
employee welfare benefit plan providing medical care to 
participants or beneficiaries directly or through insurance, 
reimbursement, or otherwise.
      Church plans are excluded from federal requirements on 
existing employer plans such as ERISA's requirements on 
employee health benefit plans and COBRA continuation coverage 
requirements under the IRC and ERISA.
House bill
      Group health plan means an employee welfare benefit plan 
to the extent that the plan provides medical care employees and 
their dependents directly or through insurance, reimbursement, 
or otherwise, and includes a group health plan within the 
meaning of section 5000(b)(1) of the IRC.
      The provisions of this subtitle (other than those 
relating to individual coverage) apply to group health plans 
with 2 or more participants as current employees on the first 
day of the plan year.
      The requirements would not apply to church plans unless 
such plans met the exemption for multiple employer health plans 
under subtitle c (see item V). For purposes of applying the 
provisions related to qualified prior coverage (II(B) below), a 
group health plan could elect to disregard periods of coverage 
of an individual under a church plan that is not subject to 
this subtitle.
      Governmental plans could elect not to be a group health 
plan covered under the subtitle. For purposes of applying the 
provisions related to qualified prior coverage, a group health 
plan could elect not to include coverage under a governmental 
plan that elected to be excluded from this subtitle's 
requirements.
Senate amendment
      Employee health benefit plan means any employee welfare 
benefit plan, governmental plan, or church plan, or any health 
benefit plan under section 5(e) of the Peace Corps Act, that 
provides or pays for health benefit for participants or 
beneficiaries whether directly, through a group health plan 
offered by a health plan issuer (see item III(A) below), or 
otherwise.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement defines a group health plan as 
an employee welfare benefit plan to the extent that the plan 
provides medical care to employees or their dependents directly 
or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise. Both 
governmental and church plans are included, but certain plans 
with limited coverage are excluded.
      The portability and guaranteed availability provisions 
(other than those relating to individual coverage) apply to 
group health plans with 2 or more participants who are active 
employees on the first day of the plan year. These provisions 
would apply to nonfederal governmental plans, unless they 
elected to be excluded as described below, and to church and 
governmental plans. (See section III(B)(3) below for exceptions 
from availability, renewability, and portability requirements 
for group health plans and group health insurance coverage for 
certain benefits.)
      Nonfederal governmental plans could elect not to be a 
group health plan covered under the amendments to the PHS. An 
election would apply for a single specified plan year, or, in 
the case of a plan provided pursuant to a collective bargaining 
agreement, for the term of such agreement. If a nonfederal 
governmental plan makes this election, it must notify enrollees 
of the fact and consequences of the election. The plan must 
still provide certification and disclosure of creditable 
coverage under the plan to enrollees who leave the plan, for 
purposes of portability.
      Upon request, Medicare, Medicaid, a program of the Indian 
Health Service or a tribal organization, and military-sponsored 
health care programs must also provide notice of previous 
creditable coverage to individuals who leave such coverage.

     b. portability of coverage for previously covered individuals

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that in general, a group 
health plan and an insurer or HMO offering health insurance 
coverage in connection with a group health plan would have to 
reduce any preexisting condition limitation period by the 
length of the aggregate period of prior coverage. Prior 
coverage would not qualify under this provision if there was 
more than a 60-day break in coverage under a group health plan. 
(Waiting periods would not be considered a break in coverage.) 
Qualified coverage would include coverage of the individual 
under a group health plan, health insurance coverage, Medicare, 
Medicaid, Tricare, a program of the Indian Health Service, and 
State health insurance coverage or risk pool, and coverage 
under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program (FEHBP).
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment is similar. An employee benefit plan 
or a health plan issuer offering a group health plan would have 
to reduce any preexisting condition limitation period by 1 
month for each month for which the person was in a period of 
previous qualifying coverage. This provision would not apply if 
there was a break of more than 30 days. (Waiting periods would 
not be considered a break in coverage.) Previous qualifying 
coverage includes enrollment under an employee health benefit 
plan, group health plan, individual health plan, or under a 
public or private health plan established under federal or 
state law.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that in general, group 
health plans, and health insurance issuers offering group 
health insurance coverage, would have to reduce any preexisting 
condition limitation period by the length of the aggregate 
period of prior creditable coverage. Prior coverage would not 
qualify under this provision if there was a break in coverage 
under a group health plan that was longer than a 63-day period. 
(Waiting periods and affiliation periods would not be 
considered a break in coverage.) Creditable coverage includes 
coverage of the individual under a group health plan (including 
a governmental or church plan), health insurance coverage 
(either group or individual insurance), Medicare, Medicaid, 
military-sponsored health care, a program of the Indian Health 
Service, a State health benefits risk pool, the FEHBP, a public 
health plan as defined in regulations, and any health benefit 
plan under section 5(e) of the Peace Corps Act. An individual 
would establish a creditable coverage period through 
presentation of certifications describing previous coverage, or 
through other procedures specified in regulations to carry out 
this provision. The conferees intend that creditable coverage 
includes short-term, limited coverage.

         1. Method for establishing qualified coverage periods

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that a group health plan or 
insurer or HMO offering health insurance coverage in connection 
with a group health plan could determine qualified coverage 
periods without regard to the specific benefits offered, 
referred to as the standard method. Alternatively, it could 
make such determination on a benefit-specific basis and not 
include as a qualified coverage period a specific benefit that 
had not been included at the end of the most recent period of 
coverage. If this alternative method were to be used, the group 
plan or insurer would be required to state prominently in any 
disclosure statements and to each enrollee at the time of 
enrollment that such a method of determining qualifying 
coverage was being used, and include a description of the 
effect of this method. The plan, insurer, or HMO would request 
a certification from prior plan administrators, insurers, or 
HMOs which discloses the plan statement related to health 
benefits under the plan or other detailed benefit information 
on the benefits available under the previous plan or coverage. 
The entity providing the certification could charge the 
reasonable cost for providing the benefit information to the 
requesting plan or insurer.
Senate bill
      The Senate Amendment would provide that an employee 
health benefit plan or health plan issuer offering a group plan 
could impose a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to 
the treatment of a preexisting condition only to the extent 
that such service or benefit was not previously covered under 
the plan in which the participant or beneficiary was enrolled 
immediately prior to enrollment in the plan involved.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that a group health 
plan, and issuer offering group health insurance coverage, 
could determine creditable coverage periods without regard to 
the specific benefits covered during the period. Alternatively, 
it could make such determination based on several classes or 
categories of benefits, as specified in regulations. A group 
health plan and issuer would be required to count a period of 
creditable coverage with respect to any class or category of 
benefits if any level of benefits is provided. This alternative 
would have to be used uniformly for all participants and 
beneficiaries.
      It is the intent of the conferees that the alternate 
method be available to account for significant differences in 
benefits. For example, the inclusion versus exclusion of a 
category of benefits such as pharmaceuticals could be 
considered a difference in classes of benefits. Similarly, 
significant differentials in deductibles could be considered 
differences in classes of benefits, but the alternative method 
would not apply to small differences in deductibles, such as 
$250 versus $200. The alternative method would not apply for 
differences in specific services or treatments.
      If the alternate method were to be used, the group health 
plan and issuer would be required to state prominently in any 
disclosure statements that such a method of determining 
qualifying coverage was being used, and would be required to 
include a description of the effect of this election. A group 
health plan using the alternate method would be required to 
notify each enrollee at the time of enrollment that the plan 
had made such an election, and describe the effect. An issuer 
would be required to notify each employer at the time of offer 
or sale of the coverage.

                   2. Certification of prior coverage

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would require the plan administrator of a 
group health plan, or the insurer or HMO offering health 
insurance coverage to a group plan, on request made on behalf 
of an individual covered or previously covered within the past 
18 months under the plan or coverage, to provide for a 
certification of the period of coverage of the individual under 
the plan and of the waiting period (if any) imposed.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would require an employee health 
plan to provide documentation of coverage to participants and 
beneficiaries whose coverage was terminated under the plan. As 
specified by regulation, the duty of an employee health benefit 
plan to verify previous qualifying coverage would be discharged 
when such plan provided documentation to the participant or 
beneficiary including the following information: (1) the dates 
that the person was covered under the plan; and (2) the 
benefits and cost-sharing arrangement available to the person 
under the plan.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement requires the group health plan, 
and health insurance issuer offering group health insurance 
coverage, to provide a certification of the period of 
creditable coverage under the plan, the coverage under any 
applicable COBRA continuation provision, and waiting period (if 
any) (and affiliation period if applicable) imposed on the 
individual. This certification would have to be provided when 
the individual ceases to be covered under the plan or otherwise 
becomes covered under a COBRA continuation provision, after any 
COBRA continuation coverage ceases, and on the request of an 
individual not later than 24 months after coverage ceased. The 
certification may be provided, to the extent practicable, at a 
time consistent with notices required under any applicable 
COBRA continuation provision. A group health plan offering 
medical care through health insurance coverage would not be 
required to provide certification if the health insurance 
issuer provides certification.
      If a group health plan or health insurance issuer elects 
the alternative method of crediting coverage, the plan or 
issuer would request, from prior entities providing coverage, 
information on coverage of classes and categories of benefits 
available under the previous plan or coverage. The entity 
providing the certification could charge the reasonable cost 
for providing such information to the requesting plan or 
insurer. The Secretary is required to establish rules to 
prevent an entity's failure to provide information on health 
benefits under previous coverage from adversely affecting any 
subsequent coverage under another group health plan or health 
insurance coverage.

   c. restrictions on use of pre-existing condition limitation period

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would restrict the use of preexisting 
condition limitation periods in group health plans and in plans 
offered by insurers and HMOs to group health plans.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment is similar but would apply to 
employee health benefit plans and group plans offered by health 
plan issuers.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement restricts the use of preexisting 
condition limitation exclusions by group health plans and 
health insurance issuers offering group health insurance 
coverage.

                 1. Definition of preexisting condition

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would define a preexisting condition to be 
a condition, regardless of the cause of condition, for which 
medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended 
or received within the 6-months ending on the day before the 
effective date of the coverage or the earliest date upon which 
such coverage would have been effective if no waiting period 
was applicable, whichever was earlier. Genetic information 
would not be considered a preexisting condition, so long as the 
treatment of the condition to which the information was 
applicable had not been sought in the 6-month period just 
described.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment provides a similar definition of 
preexisting condition. It does not include the genetic 
information language.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement defines a preexisting condition 
exclusion to be a limitation or exclusion of benefits relating 
to a condition, whether physical or mental, based on the fact 
that the condition was present before the enrollment date, 
whether or not any medical advice, diagnosis, care, or 
treatment was recommended or received before that date. Genetic 
information would not be considered a condition in the absence 
of a diagnosis of the condition related to such information.

                  2. Restrictions on limitation period

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would prohibit a group health plan, and an 
insurer or HMO offering health insurance coverage in connection 
with a group health plan from imposing a preexisting condition 
limitation period in excess of 12 months, or 18 months in the 
event of a late enrollment. A preexisting condition limitation 
period could not be applied to a newborn, adopted child, or 
child placed for adoption, so long as the individual became 
covered within 30 days of birth or adoption or placement for 
adoption. Preexisting condition limitation periods would not 
apply to pregnancies. An HMO could impose an eligibility period 
as an alternative to a preexisting condition limitation period 
but only if it did not exceed 60 days for timely enrollment and 
90 days for late enrollment. An HMO could use alternative 
methods to address adverse selection as approved by state 
regulators.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment includes a similar provision, but 
with respect to affiliation periods of an HMO, would specify 
that during such a period the plan could not be required to 
provide health care services or benefits and no premium could 
be charged to the participant or beneficiary.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement permits a group health plan and 
health insurance issuers to impose a preexisting condition 
exclusion if the exclusion relates to a condition (whether 
physical or mental), regardless of the cause of condition, for 
which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was 
recommended or received within the 6-month period ending on the 
enrollment date. The exclusion could extend to not more than 12 
months (18 months for late enrollees) after the enrollment 
date. The exclusion would be reduced by the aggregate of the 
periods of creditable coverage. Enrollment date is defined as 
the date of enrollment in the plan or coverage or, if earlier, 
the first day of the waiting period for such enrollment.
      Any waiting period or affiliation period would run 
concurrently with any preexisting condition exclusion period. A 
preexisting condition limitation period could not be applied to 
a newborn, an adopted child or child placed for adoption under 
age 18, so long as the individual becomes covered under 
creditable coverage within 30 days of birth or adoption or 
placement for adoption. These exceptions for newborns and 
certain adopted children would not apply if the individual had 
a break in coverage longer than a 63-day period. Preexisting 
condition exclusions could not apply to pregnancies.
      A group health plan offering health insurance coverage 
through an HMO, or an HMO which offers health insurance 
coverage in connection with a group health plan, may impose an 
affiliation period only if no preexisting condition exclusion 
is imposed, the period is imposed uniformly without regard to 
health status, and does not exceed 2 months for timely 
enrollment and 3 months for late enrollment. It is the intent 
of the conferees that any affiliation period would apply to all 
new enrollees and beneficiaries. During the affiliation period, 
the HMO could not be required to provide health care services 
or benefits and no premium could be charged to the participant 
or beneficiary. The affiliation period would begin on the 
enrollment date and would run concurrently with any other 
applicable waiting period under the plan. An HMO could use 
alternative methods to address adverse selection as approved by 
state regulators.

       d. prohibiting exclusions based on health status (access)

Current law
      Under section 510 of ERISA, an employee benefit plan may 
not discriminate against a particular beneficiary for 
exercising any right to which he or she is entitled under the 
provisions of an employee benefit plan. Section 105(h) of the 
IRC prohibits discrimination in favor of highly compensated 
individuals by self-insured employer health plans.
House bill
      Except as specified below, a group health plan, and an 
insurer or HMO offering coverage in connection with a plan, 
cannot exclude an employee or his or her beneficiary from being 
(or continuing to be enrolled) as a participant or beneficiary 
under the plan based on health status. Health status includes, 
with respect to an individual, medical condition, claims 
experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic 
information, evidence of insurability (including conditions 
arising out of domestic violence), or disability. A group 
health plan and an insurer or HMO offering coverage in 
connection with a group health plan cannot require a premium or 
contribution which is greater than such premium or contribution 
for a similarly situated participant or beneficiary solely on 
the basis of health status. It can, however, vary the premium 
or contribution based on factors that are not directly related 
to health status (such as scope of benefits, geographic area of 
resident, or wage levels).
      The House bill provides that nothing is intended to 
affect the premium rates an insurer or HMO could charge an 
employer for health insurance coverage provided in connection 
with a group health plan.
      A group health plan (or insurer or HMO providing coverage 
in connection to a group plan) could establish premium 
discounts or modify otherwise applicable copayments or 
deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health 
promotion and disease prevention.
Senate amendment
      Except as specified below, a health plan issuer offering 
a group health plan may not decline to offer whole group 
coverage to a group purchaser desiring to purchase the 
coverage. An employee health benefit plan or a health plan 
issuer offering a group health plan could not condition 
eligibility, enrollment, or premium contribution requirements 
based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, 
receipt of health care, medical history, evidence of 
insurability (including conditions arising out of domestic 
violence), genetic information, or disability.
      The bill does not include a specific rule of construction 
relating to premium rates charged to group health plans other 
than a prohibition of premium contribution requirements based 
on health status.
      A group health plan (or insurer of HMO providing coverage 
in connection to a group plan) could establish premium 
discounts or modify otherwise applicable copayments or 
deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health 
promotion and disease prevention.
Conference agreement
      Except as specified below, a group health plan, and a 
health insurance issuer offering group health insurance 
coverage, cannot establish rules for eligibility (including 
continued eligibility) of an individual to enroll under the 
terms of the plan based on any of the following health-related 
factors in relation to the individual or a dependent of the 
individual: health status, medical condition (including both 
physical and mental illness), claims experience, receipt of 
health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of 
insurability (including conditions arising out of domestic 
violence), or disability.
      The inclusion of evidence of insurability in the 
definition of health status is intended to ensure, among other 
things, that individuals are not excluded from health care 
coverage due to their participation in activities such as 
motorcycling, snowmobiling, all-terrain vehicle riding, 
horseback riding, skiing and other similar activities.
      It is the intent of the conferees that a plan cannot 
knowingly be designed to exclude individuals and their 
dependents on the basis of health status. However, generally 
applicable terms of the plan may have a disparate impact on 
individual enrollees. For example, a plan may exclude all 
coverage of a specific condition, or may include a lifetime cap 
on all benefits, or a lifetime cap on specific benefits. 
Although individuals with the specific condition would be 
adversely affected by an exclusion of coverage for that 
condition, and individuals with serious illnesses may be 
adversely affected by a lifetime cap on all or specific 
benefits, such plan characteristics would be permitted as long 
as they are not directed at individual sick employees or 
dependents.
      The Conference agreement does not require a group health 
plan or health insurance coverage to provide particular 
benefits other than those provided under the terms of the plan 
or coverage. Nor does it prevent any plan or coverage from 
establishing limitations or restrictions on the amount, level, 
extent, or nature of the benefits or coverage for similarly 
situated individuals enrolled in the plan or coverage. Rules 
defining any applicable waiting periods for enrollment may not 
be established based on health status related factors.
      It is the intent of the conferees that a plan or coverage 
cannot single out an individual based on the health status or 
health status related factors of that individual for denial of 
a benefit otherwise provided other individuals covered under 
the plan or coverage. For example, the plan or coverage may not 
deny coverage for prescription drugs to a particular 
beneficiary or dependent if such coverage is available to other 
similarly situated individual covered under the plan or 
coverage. However, the plan or coverage could deny coverage for 
prescription drugs to all beneficiaries and dependents. The 
term ``similarly situated'' means that a plan or coverage would 
be permitted to vary benefits available to different groups of 
employees, such as full-time versus part-time employees or 
employees in different geographic locations. In addition, a 
plan or coverage could have different benefit schedules for 
different collective bargaining units.
      The conference agreement provides that a group health 
plan and an issuer offering group coverage cannot require a 
premium or contribution which is greater than such premium or 
contribution for a similarly situated individual enrolled in 
the plan on the basis of any health status-related factor 
relating to the individual or to any individual enrolled under 
the plan as a dependent of the individual. It does not restrict 
the amount that an employer may be charged for coverage under a 
group health plan. The group health plan and health insurance 
issuer may establish premium discounts or rebates, or modify 
otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for 
adherence to programs of health promotion and disease 
prevention.
      The conferees intend that these provisions preclude 
insurance companies from denying coverage to employers based on 
health status and related factors that they have traditionally 
used. In addition, this provision is meant to prohibit insurers 
or employers from excluding employees in a group from coverage 
or charging them higher premiums based on their health status 
and other related factors that could lead to higher health 
costs. This does not mean that an entire group cannot be 
charged more. But it does preclude health plans from singling 
out individuals in the group for higher premiums or dropping 
them from coverage altogether.

          1. Exceptions to the non-discrimination requirement

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision for group health plans (i.e., the plans of 
the employer). See item III(B) below on requirements on 
insurers and HMOs.
Senate amendment
      Exceptions are provided to health plan issuers with 
respect to enrollment in the event that: (1) the health plan 
ceases to offer coverage to any additional group purchasers; or 
(2) the issuer can demonstrate to the state insurance regulator 
that to enroll new people would impair its financial or 
provider capacity. See item III-B(3) below.
Conference agreement
      See item III(B) below on requirements for health plan 
issuers offering group health insurance coverage.

     e. enrollment of eligible individuals who lose other coverage

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would require group health plans to permit 
an uncovered employee (or uncovered dependent) otherwise 
eligible for coverage to enroll under at least one benefit 
option if certain conditions are met: (1) the person was 
already covered when the plan was previously offered; (2) the 
person stated in writing at such time that another source of 
coverage was the reason for declining enrollment; (3) the 
person lost coverage as a result of a loss of eligibility or 
termination from or reduction in hours of employment; and (4) 
the person requested enrollment within 30 days after the date 
of the coverage's termination.
      If a group health plan offered dependent coverage, it 
could not require, as a condition of coverage as a dependent, a 
waiting period applicable to: (1) a newborn, (2) adopted child 
or child placed for adoption, or (3) a spouse, at the time of 
marriage if the person had met any applicable waiting period.
      Enrollment of a participant's beneficiary would be 
considered to be timely if a request for enrollment were made 
within 30 days of the date family coverage was first made 
available or, in the case of a newborn or adoption or placement 
for adoption, within 30 days of that event; and in the case of 
marriage, within 30 days of the date of the marriage, if family 
coverage was available.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would require employee health 
benefit plans to provide for special enrollment periods 
extending for a reasonable time after certain qualifying events 
to permit the participant to change individual or family basis 
of coverage or to enroll in the plan if coverage would have 
otherwise been available. The qualifying events would be: (1) 
changes in family status affecting eligibility under a plan 
including marriage, separation, divorce, death, birth, or 
placement of a child for adoption; (2) changes in employment 
status that would otherwise cause the loss of eligibility for 
coverage (other than COBRA continuation coverage); or (3) 
changes in employment status of a family member that results in 
a loss of eligibility under a group, individual, or employee 
health benefit plan.
      The special enrollment period would have to ensure that a 
child born or placed for adoption was deemed covered as of the 
date of birth or placement so long as the child was enrolled 
within 30 days.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement requires special enrollment 
periods for certain individuals losing other coverage and for 
certain dependent beneficiaries. It requires group health 
plans, and health insurance issuers offering group health 
insurance coverage, to permit eligible employees or dependents 
who lose other coverage to enroll under the terms of the plan 
if each of the following conditions is met: (1) the employee or 
dependent was already covered when the plan was previously 
offered; (2) the employee stated in writing at such time that 
another source of coverage was the reason for declining 
enrollment, but only if the plan sponsor or issuer required 
such a statement and provided the employee with notice of this 
requirement; (3) the person was covered under COBRA 
continuation coverage which was exhausted, or coverage was not 
under a COBRA continuation provision and was terminated as a 
result of a loss of eligibility for the coverage (including as 
a result of legal separation, divorce, death, termination of 
employment, or reduction in hours of employment) or termination 
of employer contributions towards such coverage; and (4) the 
person requested enrollment not later than 30 days after the 
loss of other coverage.
      If a group health plan offers dependent coverage, it must 
offer a dependent special enrollment period for persons 
becoming a dependent through marriage, birth, or adoption or 
placement for adoption. The dependent special enrollment period 
must last for not less than 30 days. The dependent may be 
enrolled as a dependent of the individual. If the individual is 
eligible for enrollment, but not enrolled, the individual may 
also enroll at this time. Moreover, in the case of the birth or 
adoption of a child, the spouse of the individual also may be 
enrolled as a dependent of the individual if the spouse is 
otherwise eligible for coverage but not already enrolled. If an 
individual seeks to enroll a dependent during the first 30 days 
of a dependent special enrollment period, the coverage would 
become effective as of the date of birth, of adoption or 
placement for adoption, or, in the case of marriage, not later 
than the first day of the first month beginning after the date 
the completed request for enrollment was received.

     F. Applicability of renewal requirements to multiple employer 
                              arrangements

Current law
      Under section 3(37) of ERISA, a multiemployer plan is one 
in which more than one employer contributes and which is 
established through a collective bargaining agreement. (Such 
plans are commonly found in unionized sectors of the building 
and construction, publishing, and entertainment trades, and the 
lumber, maritime, retail, food, hotel, and restaurant 
industries.) Under section 3(40) of ERISA, a multiple employer 
welfare arrangement (MEWA) is an employee welfare benefit plan 
or any other arrangement which offers or provides health 
benefits and meets additional criteria, (e.g., it must offer 
such benefits to the employees of 2 or more employers). There 
is no provision or definition under current law for ``multiple 
employer health plans.''
House bill
      Such plans could not deny an employer who employees are 
covered under the plan or arrangement continued access to the 
same or different coverage except: (1) for cause (e.g., 
nonpayment of premiums, fraud, and noncompliance with plan 
provisions); (2) because the plan is not offering coverage in a 
geographic area; or (3) due to a failure to meet the terms of 
an applicable collective bargaining agreement. Certain 
collectively bargained arrangements and ``multiple employer 
health plans'' (MEHPs) would be required to meet specific 
requirements relating to the nondiscrimination requirements. 
(MEHPs are established under this bill (see item V below) and 
are generally non-fully-insured MEWAs that meet certain 
requirements excepting them from state regulation.)
Senate amendment
      No provision. (Note that the rules regarding group and 
individual health plans (e.g., guaranteed renewal, 
nondiscrimination, and portability) or state laws not preempted 
by the Senate amendment also apply to health plans offered by 
health plan issuers to a purchasing cooperative. See item VIII 
below).
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that a group health 
plan which is a multiemployer plan or a multiple employer 
welfare arrangement may not deny an employer continued access 
to the same or different coverage under the terms of such plan 
except: (1) for nonpayment of contributions; (2) for fraud; (3) 
for noncompliance with plan provisions; (4) because the plan is 
ceasing to offer any coverage in a geographic area; (5) in the 
case of a network plan, there is no longer any individual 
enrolled through the employer who lives, resides, or works in 
the service area of the network plan, and the plan applies this 
provision uniformly without regard to claims experience or 
health status-related factors; or (6) due to a failure to meet 
the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, to 
renew a collective bargaining agreement or other agreement 
requiring or authorizing contributions to the plan, or to 
employ employees covered by such an agreement.

            G. Enforcement of group health plan requirements

Current law
      Federal requirements on existing group health plans are 
enforced through various laws, including ERISA, the Public 
Health Service (PHS) Act, the IRC, and Medicare.
House bill
      The House bill would provide for enforcement of the 
federal group health plan availability and portability 
requirements through the IRC, ERISA, and through civil monetary 
penalties imposed through the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide for enforcement of the 
federal group health plan availability and portability 
requirements through the Secretary of Labor, in consultation 
with the Secretary of Health and Human Services using ERISA 
civil enforcement provisions.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides for enforcement of the 
federal group health plan availability and portability 
requirements through the IRC, ERISA, and through civil monetary 
penalties imposed through the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services (HHS).

             1. Enforcement through COBRA provisions of IRC

Current law
      Plans that fail to comply with the IRC COBRA provision 
are subject to an excise tax of $100 per day per violation. The 
tax is not applied where the failure was determined to be 
unintentional or if the failure was corrected within 30 days. 
An overall limitation on the tax applies in the event of an 
unintentional failure.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that noncomplying plans and 
insurers and HMOs selling to group health plans would be 
subject to an excise tax of $100 per day per violation enforced 
through the COBRA provisions of the IRC. Penalties would not be 
assessed if the failure was determined to be unintentional or a 
correction was made within 30 days. No tax could be imposed on 
a noncomplying insurer or HMO subject to state insurance 
regulation if the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
determined that the state had an effective enforcement 
mechanism. In the case of a group health plan of a small 
employer that provided coverage solely through a contract with 
an insurer or HMO, no tax would be imposed upon the employer if 
the failure was solely because of the product offered by the 
insurer or HMO. No tax penalty would be assessed for a failure 
under this provision if a sanction had been imposed under ERISA 
or by the Secretary of HHS.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      See Title IV.

                      2. Enforcement through ERISA

Current law
      Under section 502 of ERISA, employee benefit plans that 
fail to comply with applicable requirements can be sued for 
relief and be subject to civil money penalties, and can be sued 
to recover any benefits due under the plan. Section 504 of 
ERISA provides the Secretary of Labor with investigative 
authority to determine whether any person is out of compliance 
with the law's requirements. Section 506 provides for 
coordination and responsibility of agencies in enforcement. 
Section 510 prohibits a health plan from discriminating against 
a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right under the 
plan.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that ERISA sanctions apply 
to group health plans by deeming the provisions of subtitle A 
and subtitle D (insofar as it is applicable to this subtitle) 
to be provisions of title I of ERISA. Such sanctions also would 
apply to an insurer or HMO that was subject to state law in the 
event that the Secretary of Labor determined that the state had 
not provided for enforcement of the above provisions of this 
Act. Sanctions would not apply in the event that the Secretary 
of Labor established that none of the persons against whom the 
liability would be imposed knew, or exercising reasonable 
diligence, would have known that a failure existed, or if the 
noncomplying entity acted within 30 days to correct the 
failure. In no case would a civil money penalty be imposed 
under ERISA for a violation for which an excise tax under the 
COBRA enforcement provisions was imposed or for which a civil 
money penalty was imposed by the Secretary of HHS.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide that for employee 
health benefit plans, the Secretary would be required to 
enforce the reform standards established by the bill in the 
same manner as provided under sections 502, 504, 506, and 510 
of ERISA. (See item IV(I) below for enforcement provisions 
relating to health plan issuers and group health plans sold to 
employers and others.)
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that provisions with 
respect to group health plans would be enforced under Title I 
of ERISA as under current law. The Secretary of Labor would not 
enforce the provisions of Title I applicable to health 
insurance issuers. However, private right of action under part 
V of ERISA would apply to such issuers. Enforcement of 
provisions with respect to health insurance issuers generally 
would be limited to civil remedies established under the PHS 
Act amendments (as described in the following subsection).
      The conference agreement provides that a state may enter 
into an agreement with the Secretary for delegation to the 
state of some or all of the Secretary's authority under 
sections 502 and 504 of ERISA to enforce the requirements of 
this part in connection with MEWAs providing medical care which 
are not group health plans.

              3. Enforcement through civil money penalties

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that a group health plan, 
insurer, or HMO that failed to meet the above requirements 
would be subject to a civil money penalty. Rules similar to 
those imposed under the COBRA penalties would apply. The 
maximum amount of penalty would be $100 for each day for each 
individual with respect to which a failure occurred. In 
determining the penalty amount, the Secretary of HHS would have 
to take into account the previous record of compliance of the 
person being assessed with the applicable requirements of this 
subtitle, the gravity of the violation, and the overall 
limitations for unintentional failures provided under the IRC 
COBRA provisions. No penalty could be assessed if the failure 
was not intentional or if the failure was corrected within 30 
days. A procedure would be available for administrative and 
judicial review of a penalty assessment. Collected penalties 
would be paid to the Secretary of HHS and would be available 
for the purpose of enforcing the provisions with respect to 
which the penalty was imposed.
      The authority for the Secretary of HHS to impose civil 
money penalties would not apply to enforcement with respect to 
any entity which offered health insurance coverage and which 
was an insurer or HMO subject to state regulation by an 
applicable state authority if the Secretary of HHS determined 
that the state had established an effective enforcement plan. 
In no case would a civil money penalty be imposed under this 
provision for a violation for which an excise tax under COBRA 
or civil money penalty under ERISA was assessed.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that each state may 
require that health insurance issuers that issue, sell, renew, 
or offer health insurance coverage in the state in the small or 
large group markets meet the Act's requirements. In the case of 
a determination by the Secretary of HHS that a state has failed 
to substantially enforce a provision or provisions of part A 
with respect to health insurance issuers in the state, the 
Secretary would enforce such provision or provisions insofar as 
they relate to the issuance, sale, renewal, and offering of 
health insurance coverage in connection with group health plans 
in the state. Secretarial enforcement would apply only in the 
absence of state enforcement and with respect to group health 
plans that are nonfederal governmental plans.
      In the case of a failure by a health insurance issuer, 
the issuer is liable for any penalty. In the case of failure by 
a group health plan that is a nonfederal governmental plan, the 
plan is liable if it is sponsored by 2 or more employers; 
otherwise the employer is liable. Rules similar to those 
imposed under the COBRA penalties would apply. The maximum 
amount of penalty for noncompliance would be $100 per day per 
individual. In determining the penalty amount, the Secretary of 
HHS would have to take into account the previous record of 
compliance and the gravity of the violation. No penalty could 
be assessed if the failure was not intentional or if the 
failure was corrected within 30 days. A procedure would be 
available for administrative and judicial review of a penalty 
assessment. Collected penalties would be paid to the Secretary 
of HHS and would be available for the purpose of enforcing the 
provisions with respect to which the penalty was imposed.

                   4. Coordination in administration

Current law
      Section 506 of ERISA provides for coordination of other 
federal agencies (e.g., the Internal Revenue Service) with the 
Department of Labor in enforcing ERISA.
House bill
      The House bill would require the Secretaries of Treasury, 
Labor, and HHS to issue regulations that are not duplicative to 
carry out this subtitle. The bill would require these 
regulations to be issued in a manner that assures coordination 
and nonduplication in their activities under this subtitle.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that the Secretaries of 
Treasury, Labor, and HHS would ensure, through execution of an 
interagency memorandum of understanding, that regulations, 
rulings, and interpretations are administered so as to have the 
same effect at all times. It requires the Secretaries to 
coordinate enforcement policies for the same requirements to 
avoid duplication of enforcement efforts and assign priorities 
in enforcement.
      It is the intent of the conferees that the committees of 
jurisdiction should work together to assure the coordination of 
policies under this Act. Such coordination is considered 
necessary to maintain consistency in the IRC, ERISA, and the 
PHS Act.

   III. Availability, Portability, and Renewability Requirements on 
    Insurers, HMOs, and Issuers of Health Plans in the Group Market

Current law
      The McCarran Ferguson Act of 1945 (P.L. 79-15) exempts 
the business of insurance from federal antitrust regulation to 
the extent that it is regulated by the states and indicates 
that no federal law should be interpreted as overriding state 
insurance regulation unless it does so explicitly. Section 
514(b)(2)(A) of ERISA leaves to the states the regulation of 
insurance. (Employee benefit plans are not insurance and are 
regulated by the federal government.)
House bill
      The House bill would establish federal requirements on 
insurers and HMOs selling in the group market to provide for 
guaranteed availability of health insurance coverage.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment is similar but would apply 
requirements to health plan issuers offering plans in the group 
market.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement establishes federal requirements 
on health insurance issuers offering group health insurance 
coverage to provide for guaranteed availability of health 
insurance coverage.

                             a. definitions

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would define insurer to mean an insurance 
company, insurance service, or insurance organization which is 
licensed to engage in the business of insurance in a state and 
which (except for the purposes of individual health insurance 
availability provisions of this subtitle) is subject to state 
law which regulates insurance within the meaning of section 
514(b)(2)(A) of ERISA.
      The House bill would define a health maintenance 
organization to mean (a) a federally qualified HMO, (b) an 
organization recognized under state law as an HMO, or (c) a 
similar organization regulated under state law for solvency in 
the same manner and extent as an HMO, if (other than for the 
purposes of individual health insurance availability provisions 
of the bill) it is subject to state law which regulates 
insurance within the meaning of section 514(b)(2) of ERISA.
      Under the House bill, a bona fide association would be 
defined as an association which (a) has been actively in 
existence for at least 5 years; (b) has been formed and 
maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining 
insurance; (c) does not condition membership in the association 
on health status; (d) makes health insurance coverage offered 
through the association available to any individual who is a 
member (or dependent of a member) of the association at the 
time the coverage is initially issued; (e) does not make health 
insurance coverage offered through the association available to 
any member who is not a member (or dependent of a member) of 
the association at the time coverage is initially issued; (f) 
does not impose preexisting condition exclusions consistent 
with the requirements of this bill relating to group health 
plans; and (g) provides for renewal and continuation of 
coverage consistent with the requirements of this bill.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would define health plan issuer as 
any entity that is licensed (prior to or after the date of 
enactment of this Act) by a state to offer a group health plan 
or an individual health plan.
      The Senate Amendment does not use the terms health 
maintenance organization, or bona fide association.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement defines a health insurance 
issuer as an insurance company, insurance service, or insurance 
organization, including an HMO, which is licensed to engage in 
the business of insurance in a state and which is subject to 
state law which regulates insurance within the meaning of 
section 514(b)(2) of ERISA. A group health plan is not a health 
insurance issuer.
      An HMO is: (a) a federally qualified HMO, (b) an 
organization recognized under state law as an HMO, or (c) a 
similar organization regulated under state law for solvency in 
the same manner and extent as an HMO.
      A bona fide association is an association which: (a) has 
been actively in existence for at least 5 years; (b) has been 
formed and maintained in good faith for purposes other than 
obtaining insurance; (c) does not condition membership in the 
association on any health status-related factor; (d) makes 
health insurance coverage offered through the association 
available to any member, or individuals eligible for coverage 
through such member, regardless of any health status-related 
factor; (e) does not make health insurance coverage offered 
through the association available other than in connection with 
a member of the association; and (f) meets additional 
requirements as may be imposed under state law.

                 b. guaranteed availability of coverage

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would require each insurer or HMO offering 
health insurance coverage in the small group market to accept 
every small employer in the state that applied for coverage and 
to accept for enrollment under such coverage every eligible 
individual who applied for enrollment during the initial 
enrollment period in which the individual first became eligible 
for the group coverage. No restriction could be imposed on an 
eligible individual based on his or her health status. An 
eligible individual is determined in accordance with the terms 
of the plan consistent with all applicable state laws.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would require a health plan issuer 
offering a group health plan to accept the whole group desiring 
to purchase the coverage. A health plan issuer offering a group 
health plan could not condition eligibility, continuation of 
eligibility, enrollment, or premium contribution requirements 
based on health status. (Health status is defined the same as 
under the House bill.)
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement requires each health insurance 
issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the small group 
market in a state to accept every small employer in the state 
that applies for coverage, and to accept for enrollment under 
such coverage every eligible individual who applies for 
enrollment during the period in which the individual first 
became eligible to enroll under the terms of the group health 
plan. The health plan issuer may not impose restrictions on any 
eligible individual being a participant or beneficiary based on 
his or her health status, or the health status of dependents. 
An eligible individual is determined in accordance with the 
terms of the plan, as provided by the health insurance issuer 
under the rules of the issuer which are uniformly applicable in 
a state to small employers in the small group market, and 
consistent with all applicable state laws governing the issuer 
and market.

                        1. Scope of requirement

Current law
      No provision.
 House bill
      The House bill provides that the guaranteed availability 
requirement apply to the small group market only. Small groups 
are those with 2 to 50 employees.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment provides that the guaranteed 
availability requirement apply to all health plan issuers and 
group health plans.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that the guaranteed 
availability requirement applies to the small group market 
only. Small groups are those with 2 to 50 employees on a 
typical business day.
      To assure access in the large group market, the 
conference agreement provides that the Secretary of HHS request 
that the chief executive officer of each state submit a report 
on the access of large employers to health insurance coverage 
and the circumstances for lack of access to coverage, if any, 
of large employers, and classes of employers. The Secretary 
shall request the reports not later than December 31, 2000 and 
every 3 years thereafter. Based on the state reports and other 
information, the Secretary would be required to prepare a 
report for Congress, every 3 years, describing the access to 
health insurance for large employers, and classes of employers 
in each state. The Secretary may include recommendations to 
assure access.
      In addition, the Comptroller General will submit to 
Congress not later than 18 months after the date of enactment 
of this Act, a report on access of classes of large employers 
to health insurance coverage in the different states, and the 
circumstances for lack of access, if any.

      2. Restrictions on preexisting condition limitation periods

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide for the same restrictions on 
the use of preexisting condition limitations by each insurer 
and HMO that offers health insurance coverage in connection 
with a group health plan as those described in above item II-
(C).
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment would provide for the same 
restrictions on the use of preexisting condition limitations by 
health plan issuers as described in above item II-(C).
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides us for the same 
restrictions on the use of preexisting condition limitations by 
each health insurance issuer that offers group health insurance 
coverage as those described in above item II-(C).

                3. Exceptions to guaranteed availability

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that an HMO or an insurer 
offering coverage in the small group market through a network 
plan could: (1) limit employers for such coverage to those with 
eligible individuals whose place of employment or residence was 
in the plan's or HMO's service area; (2) limit the individuals 
who might be enrolled to those whose place of residence or 
employment was within the service area; (3) within the service 
area, deny coverage if the plan or HMO demonstrated lack of 
capacity to deliver services adequately, but only if it was 
applying the capacity limit to all employers without regard to 
the group's claims experience or the health status of its 
participants and beneficiaries. Those denying coverage on the 
basis of capacity could not offer small groups coverage in the 
service area for 180 days. Similar exceptions would apply in 
the event of financial capacity limits.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment would provide that a health plan 
issuer offering a group health plan could cease offering 
coverage to group purchasers if (1) the plan ceased to offer 
coverage to any additional group purchasers, and (2) the issuer 
could demonstrate to the applicable certifying authority that 
its financial or provider capacity would be impaired if the 
issuer were required to offer coverage to additional group 
purchasers. Such an issuer would be prohibited from offering 
coverage for 6 months or until the issuer could demonstrate 
that the capacity was adequate, whichever was later. An issuer 
would only be eligible for this exception if it offered 
coverage on a first-come-first-served basis or other basis 
established by a state to ensure a fair opportunity to enroll 
and avoid risk selection.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that a health insurance 
issuer offering coverage in the small group market through a 
network plan could: (1) limit employers for such coverage to 
those with eligible individuals who live, work, or reside in 
the service area for the network plan; (2) within the service 
area, deny coverage to small employers if the issuer has 
demonstrated, if required, to the applicable state authority, 
the lack of capacity to deliver services adequately to 
additional groups, but only if it was applying the capacity 
limit to all employers uniformly without regard to claims 
experience or any health status-related factor. An issuer 
denying coverage on the basis of capacity could not offer 
coverage in the small group market in the service area for 180 
days.
      A health insurance issuer may deny coverage in the small 
group market if the issuer has demonstrated, if required, to 
the applicable state authority, that it does not have the 
financial reserves necessary to underwrite additional coverage. 
The issuer would be required to apply the financial capacity 
limit to all employers in the small group market in the state, 
consistent with applicable state law, and without regard to 
claims experience or health status-related factors. An issuer 
denying coverage on the basis of financial capacity could not 
offer coverage in the small group market in the service area 
for 180 days or until the issuer has demonstrated, if required, 
to the applicable state authority, that it has adequate 
capacity, whichever is later. A State may provide for 
determination of adequate capacity on a service-area-specific 
basis. It is the intent of the conferees that an issuer denying 
coverage on the basis of capacity limitations may demonstrate 
compliance if enrollment is provided on a first-come first-
serve basis, or other state approved method.
      The conference agreement imposes requirements for renewal 
and continuation on issuers offering health insurance plans to 
bona fide associations, but does not require these issuers to 
guarantee issue of the coverage offered to bona fide 
associations. The conferees do not intend the provision to mean 
that issuers of coverage to an association have to offer a 
particular association plan to any other employer. Thus issuers 
offering coverage to associations are not required to guarantee 
issue the association's plan to other small employers. 
Nondiscrimination rules would apply to these association plans, 
and no employee or dependent could be excluded from coverage on 
the basis of any health status-related factor.
      The conference agreement provides exceptions to the 
availability, renewability and portability requirements for 
group health plans and group health insurance coverage for 
certain benefits, sometimes under certain conditions. First, 
these requirements would not apply to provision of certain 
excepted benefits including: coverage only for accident, or 
disability insurance, or any combination thereof; coverage 
issued as a supplement to liability insurance; liability 
insurance; workers' compensation or similar insurance; 
automobile medical payment insurance; credit-only insurance; 
coverage for on-site medical clinics; and, other similar 
coverage, as specified in regulations, under which benefits for 
medical care are secondary or incidental to other insurance 
benefits.
      Second, if the following benefits are (a) provided under 
a separate policy, certificate, or contract or insurance, or 
(b) if the benefits are otherwise not an integral part of the 
plan, the requirements would not apply to: limited scope dental 
or vision benefits; benefits for long-term care, nursing home 
care, home health care, community-based care, or any 
combination thereof; or, similar limited benefits as specified 
in regulations.
      Third, if the following benefits: (a) are provided under 
a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance; (b) 
there is no coordination between the provision of these 
benefits and any exclusion of benefits under any group health 
plan maintained by the same plan sponsor; and (c) such benefits 
are paid with respect to an event without regard to whether 
benefits are provided for that event under any group health 
plan maintained by the same plan sponsor, the requirements 
would not apply to: coverage only for a specified disease or 
illness, or hospital indemnity or other fixed indemnity 
insurance.
      Fourth, if the following benefits are provided under a 
separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance, the 
requirements would not apply to: Medicare supplemental health 
insurance; coverage supplemental to coverage provided under 
military health care; and, similar supplemental coverage 
provided to coverage under a group health plan.

 4. Exceptions for failure to meet participation or contribution rules

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that an exception to the 
guaranteed availability requirement would apply in the case of 
any group health plan which failed to meet the participation or 
contribution rules of the insurer or HMO. Such participation 
and contribution rules would have to be uniformly applicable 
and in accordance with state law.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that an exception to 
the guaranteed availability requirement would apply in the case 
of any group health plan which failed to meet the participation 
or contribution rules of the health insurance issuer. Such 
participation and contribution rules would have to be in 
accordance with state law.

                       c. guaranteed renewability

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that regardless of the size 
of the group, insurers and HMOs would be required to renew or 
continue in force coverage at the option of the covered 
employer with certain exceptions.
Senate amendment
      The Senate provision is similar but at the option of the 
group purchaser.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that a health insurance 
issuer offering group health insurance coverage in the small or 
large group market would be required to renew or continue in 
force coverage at the option of the plan sponsor of the plan.

       1. Exceptions to guaranteed renewability of group coverage

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide exceptions to the guaranteed 
renewability requirement for: nonpayment of premiums, fraud, 
violation of participation and contribution rules, termination 
of the plan in a state or geographic area, or the employer 
moved outside the service area (but only if this last provision 
was applied uniformly without regard to health status). 
Exceptions to guaranteed renewability would also apply in the 
event that the insurer or plan no longer offered a particular 
type of coverage but only if prior notice was provided, the 
employer was given the chance to buy another plan offered by 
the insurer or HMO, and the termination was applied uniformly 
without regard to health status or insurability. An exception 
would also apply in the event of discontinuance of all 
coverage, but only if certain conditions were met. In this 
instance, the insurer or HMO could not market small and/or 
large group coverage for 5 years.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment is similar. It would include as 
exceptions to the guaranteed renewability requirement the loss 
of eligibility of COBRA continuation coverage, and failure of a 
participant or beneficiary to meet requirements for eligibility 
for coverage under the group health plan that are not 
prohibited by this subtitle.
      A network plan could deny continued participation under 
the plan to participant or beneficiaries who did not live, 
reside, or work in an area in which the plan was offered, but 
only if the denial was applied uniformly, without regard to 
health status or insurability.
      The provisions relating to discontinuation of a plan or 
of coverage in general are similar to the House bill.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides exceptions to the 
guaranteed renewability requirement for one or more of the 
following: (1) nonpayment of premiums; (2) fraud; (3) violation 
of participation or contribution rules; (4) termination of 
coverage in the market in accordance with applicable state law, 
as outlined below; (5) for network plans, no enrollees 
connected to the plan live, reside, or work in the service area 
of the issuer, or area for which the issuer is authorized to do 
business, and, in the case of the small group market only if 
the issuer would deny enrollment to the plan under regulations 
governing guaranteed availability of coverage; (6) for coverage 
made available to bona fide associations, if membership in the 
association ceases, but only if coverage is terminated 
uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor 
relating to any covered individual.
      Exceptions to guaranteed renewability would also apply if 
the issuer or plan no longer offered a particular type of group 
coverage in the small or large group market so long as the 
issuer, in accordance with applicable state law: (1) provided 
prior notice to each plan sponsor and participants and 
beneficiaries; (2) gave the plan sponsor the chance to purchase 
all (or, in the case of the large group market, any) other 
plans offered by the issuer in such market; and (3) applied the 
termination uniformly without regard to the claims experience 
of the sponsors or any health status-related factor to any 
participants or beneficiaries covered or new participants or 
beneficiaries who may become eligible for such coverage.
      An exception would also apply in the event of 
discontinuance of all coverage, but only if certain conditions 
were met. In this instance, the issuer could not offer coverage 
in the market and state involved for 5 years.
      Issuers would be permitted to modify the health insurance 
coverage for a product offered to a group health plan in the 
large group market, and in the small group market if the 
modification was effective on a uniform basis among group 
health plans with that product.
      For example, the conferees intend that issuers could 
uniformly modify the terms of treatment for particular 
conditions among group health plans within a type of coverage. 
An exception would apply to coverage available in the small 
group market only through 1 or more bona fide associations. 
Issuers could modify a product offered to a group plan in the 
large group market.
      See section B(3) above for exceptions from availability, 
renewability, and portability requirements for certain 
benefits.

          d. disclosure of information by health plan issuers

Current law
      Section 101 of ERISA requires covered plans to furnish 
summary plan descriptions and other information and notices to 
plan participants and the Secretary of Labor. Section 104 of 
ERISA requires covered plans to file certain information with 
the Secretary of Labor and to furnish certain information to 
plan participants.
House bill
      The House bill does not include a provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would require that in connection 
with the offering of any group health plan to a small employer 
(defined under state law or, if not so defined, one with not 
more than 50 employees), that a health plan issuer make a 
reasonable disclosure as part of its solicitation and sales 
materials of certain information, such as the provisions of the 
plan concerning the right of the issuer to change premium rates 
and the factors that could affect such changes, the provisions 
of the plan relating to renewability and any preexisting 
condition provisions, and descriptive information about the 
plan's benefits and premiums. The information would have to be 
understandable by the average small employer and sufficiently 
accurate and comprehensive to reasonably inform employers, 
participants, and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations 
under the plan. These requirements would not apply to 
proprietary and trade secret information under applicable law 
and do not preempt state reporting and disclosure requirements.
      The Senate Amendment would amend section 104(b)(1) of 
ERISA relating to the summary plan description to provide that 
if there is a modification or change described in the summary 
plan description that is a material reduction in covered 
services or benefits provided, a summary of such changes would 
have to be furnished to participants within 60 days after the 
date of its adoption. Alternatively, plans sponsors could 
provide such a description at regular intervals of not more 
than 90 days. The bill requires the Secretary of Labor to issue 
regulations providing alternative mechanisms to delivering by 
mail through which employee benefit plans may notify 
participants of material reductions in covered services. It 
further amends the summary plan description provisions of ERISA 
to require the inclusion of certain information.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement requires a health plan issuer 
offering any health insurance coverage to a small employer to 
make a reasonable disclosure of the availability of information 
as part of its solicitation and sales materials. At the small 
employer's request, the issuer must provide the provisions of 
the plan concerning the right of the issuer to change premium 
rates and the factors that could affect such changes, the 
provisions of the plan relating to renewability and any 
preexisting condition provisions, and the benefits and premiums 
under all health insurance coverage for which the employer is 
qualified. The information would have to be understandable by 
the average small employer and sufficient to reasonably inform 
small employers of their rights and obligations under the 
health insurance coverage. These requirements would not apply 
to proprietary and trade secret information under applicable 
law.
      The conference agreement would amend section 104(b)(1) of 
ERISA relating to the summary plan description to provide that 
if there is a material reduction in covered services or 
benefits, a summary of such changes would have to be furnished 
to participants within 60 days after the date of its adoption. 
Alternatively, plan sponsors could provide a description at 
regular intervals of not more than 90 days. The conference 
agreement requires the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations 
within 180 days of enactment of this Act which would provide 
for alternative mechanisms, besides delivery by mail, through 
which employee benefit plans may notify participants of 
material reductions in covered services. It further amends the 
summary plan description provisions of ERISA to require the 
inclusion of certain information.
      The conference agreement would amend section 101 of ERISA 
to permit the Secretary, in accordance with regulations 
prescribed by the Secretary, to require MEWAs that provide 
medical care benefits, but are not group health plans, to 
report, not more frequently than annually, in such form and 
manner as the Secretary may require to determine the extent to 
which the requirements of this part are being carried out.

                          e. state flexibility

Current law
      The McCarran Ferguson Act of 1945 (P.L. 79-15) exempts 
the business of insurance from federal antitrust regulation to 
the extent that it is regulated by the states and indicates 
that no federal law should be interpreted as overriding state 
insurance regulation unless it does so explicitly. Section 514 
of ERISA leaves to the states the regulation of insurance. 
(Employee benefit plans are not insurance and are regulated by 
the federal government.)
House bill
      The House bill would provide that unless preempted by 
section 514 of ERISA, state laws would not be preempted that 
(1) related to matters not specifically addressed in subtitles 
A and B, or (2) that required insurers or HMOs to: (a) impose a 
limitation or exclusion of benefits relating to the treatment 
of a preexisting condition for periods shorter than specified 
in the bill, (b) allowed persons to be considered to be in a 
period of previous qualifying coverage if they experienced a 
lapse in coverage greater than 60 days, or (c) had a look-back 
provision shorter than 6 months.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment does not include ``related to 
matters not specifically addressed in subtitles A and B.'' The 
Senate Amendment would provide that unless preempted by section 
514 of ERISA, state laws would not be preempted that (1) 
required health plan issuers to impose a limitation or 
exclusion of benefits relating to the treatment of a 
preexisting condition for periods that are shorter than 
specified in the bill; (2) allowed individuals, participants, 
and beneficiaries to be considered in a period of previous 
qualifying coverage if such person experienced a lapse in 
coverage that was greater than the 30-days provided under this 
bill; or (3) required issuers to have a lookback period shorter 
than provided for under this subtitle.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that any provision of 
state law which establishes, implements, or continues in effect 
any standard or requirement solely relating to health insurance 
issuers in connection with health insurance coverage would not 
be superseded unless the state standard or requirement prevents 
the application of a federal requirement of this part. Nothing 
in this part of the Act would affect or modify the provisions 
of section 514 of ERISA with respect to group health plans.
      The conferees intend the narrowest preemption. State laws 
which are broader than federal requirements would not prevent 
the application of federal requirements. For example, states 
may require guaranteed availability of coverage for groups of 
more than 50 employees, or for groups of 1.
      The conference agreement provides special rules in the 
case of portability requirements. State laws applicable to a 
preexisting condition exclusion which differ from the standards 
or requirements specified in this part would be superseded 
except if they: (1) shorten the lookback period in 
determination of a preexisting condition limitation (from 6 
months to any shorter period of time); (2) shorter the length 
of a preexisting condition limitation exclusion (from 12 
months, or 18 months for late enrollees, to any shorter 
period); (3) lengthen the break in coverage time from 63 days 
to any greater number; (4) lengthen the time for enrollment of 
newborns, or certain children adopted or placed for adoption, 
from 30 days to any greater number; (5) prohibit the imposition 
of any preexisting condition exclusions in cases not described, 
or expand the exclusions described; (6) require additional 
special enrollment periods; (7) reduce the maximum period 
permitted in an affiliation period.
      A group health plan or health insurance coverage is not 
required to provide specific benefits other than those provided 
under the terms of such plan or coverage.

                      IV. Individual Market Rules

Current law
      The individual health insurance market is currently 
regulated by the states. As of December, 1995, 11 states 
required that individual insurers write policies on a 
guaranteed issue basis; 16 states required guaranteed renewal; 
and 22 states limited the use of preexisting condition 
limitation periods.
House bill
      The House bill would provide for federal requirements to 
guarantee availability of individual health insurance coverage 
to certain qualified individuals with prior group coverage, 
without limitation or exclusion of benefits, and to guarantee 
renewability of individual health insurance coverage.
Senate amendment
      Similar.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides for federal 
requirements to guarantee availability of individual health 
insurance coverage to certain qualified individuals with prior 
group coverage, without limitation or exclusion of benefits, 
and to guarantee renewability of individual health insurance 
coverage.

   A. Guaranteed availability of individual health insurance coverage

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would include goals that any qualifying 
individual would be able to obtain qualifying coverage and that 
qualifying individuals would receive credit for prior coverage 
toward the new coverage's preexisting condition exclusion 
period, if any. If states fail to implement programs meeting 
these goals, a federal fall back requirement would take effect 
requiring that each individual insurer enroll all eligible 
individuals and that such persons receive credit for their 
prior coverage toward any preexisting condition limitation 
period. (See item IV(D) below on exceptions for network plans 
and HMOs.)
      The House bill would require that any preexisting 
condition exclusion period be reduced by the length of the 
aggregate period of qualified prior coverage. To determine 
qualified coverage, the plan could choose one of two 
alternatives: (1) it could disregard specific benefits covered 
and include all periods of coverage from qualified sources; or 
(2) it could examine prior coverage on a benefit-specific 
basis, and exclude from qualified coverage any specific 
benefits not covered under the most recent prior plan. If the 
second method were chosen, plans would be required to disclose 
this procedure at the time of enrollment or sale of the plan.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide that all health plan 
issuers that issue or renew individual health plans must enroll 
all eligible individuals except if the insurer demonstrates 
that it would have financial problems, or, that its ability to 
service individuals already enrolled in the plan would diminish 
if new enrollees were allowed to join the plan. In these cases, 
the insurer would be prohibited from enrolling new individuals 
for a period of 6 months, or, if later, when the insurer could 
demonstrate that they could properly service new entrants. An 
insurer would have to enroll individuals on a first-come-first-
served basis, or other basis determined by the state, to be 
eligible for this limitation. States implementing guaranteed 
availability programs meeting certain requirements would be 
excepted from the federal requirements.
      The Senate amendment would provide that a health plan 
issuer may not impose a limitation or exclusion of benefits on 
benefits that were covered under prior health plans.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that each health 
insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the 
individual market in a state may not decline to offer coverage 
to, or deny enrollment of an eligible individual and may not 
impose any preexisting condition exclusions with respect to 
such coverage. This requirement will not apply in States with 
acceptable alternative mechanisms as described in section IV(E) 
below. In addition, in States without an acceptable alternative 
mechanism, a health insurance issuer may limit the coverage 
offered as described in section IV(C).

                   B. Qualifying/eligible individuals

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that qualifying individuals 
are individuals: with 18 or more months of qualified coverage 
periods; with most recent prior coverage from a group health 
plan, governmental plan, or church plan; ineligible for group 
health coverage, Medicare Parts A or B, Medicaid, and without 
individual coverage; not terminated from most recent prior 
coverage for nonpayment of premiums or fraud; who, if eligible 
for continuation coverage under COBRA or similar state program, 
elected and exhausted this coverage; and who applied for 
individual coverage not more than 60 days after the last day of 
coverage under a group plan, or the termination date of COBRA 
benefits.
Senate amendment
      Similar, but individual would have to apply for 
individual coverage not more than 30 days after the last day of 
coverage under a group plan.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement defines eligible individuals as 
individuals: with 18 or more months of aggregate creditable 
coverage; with most recent prior coverage from a group health 
plan, governmental plan, or church plan (or health insurance 
coverage offered in connection with any such plan); ineligible 
for group health coverage, Medicare Parts A or B, Medicaid (or 
any successor program), and without any other health insurance 
coverage; not terminated from their most recent prior coverage 
for nonpayment of premiums or fraud; and who, if eligible for 
continuation coverage under COBRA or a similar state program, 
elected and exhausted this coverage.

                         C. Qualifying coverage

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would require coverage with an actuarial 
value of benefits not less than the weighted average actuarial 
value of the benefits provided by all the individual health 
insurance coverage (excluding coverage issued under this 
section) during the previous year, issued by: (1) the insurer 
or HMO in the state; or (2) all insurers and HMOs in the state. 
Requires that the actuarial value of benefits be calculated 
based on a standardized population and a set of standardized 
utilization and cost factors.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement requires individual health 
insurance issuers to offer coverage to eligible individuals 
under all policy forms with exceptions. First, a health 
insurance issuer may not offer coverage under all policy forms 
if the state is implementing an acceptable alternative 
mechanism (see section IV(E) below). If a state is not 
implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism, the health 
insurance issuer may elect to limit the policy forms offered to 
eligible individuals so long as it offers at least two 
different policy forms of health insurance coverage both of 
which are designed for, made generally available and actively 
marketed to, and enroll both eligible and other individuals by 
the issuer. In addition, the 2 policy forms must meet one of 
the following: (1) the 2 policy forms have the largest and next 
to the largest premium volume; or (2) the 2 policy forms are 
representative of individual health insurance coverage by the 
issuer. An issuer must apply the election uniformly to all 
eligible individuals in the state for that issuer, and the 
election will be effective for policies offered for not less 
than 2 years.
      The 2 representative policy forms would include a lower 
and higher-level of coverage, each of which has benefits 
substantially similar to other individual health insurance 
coverage offered by the issuer in the state. The lower-level 
policy form would have benefits with an actuarial value at 
least 85 percent, but not greater than 100 percent of a 
weighted average benefit. The higher-level policy form would 
have benefits with an actuarial value: (1) at least 15 percent 
greater than the actuarial value of the lower-level policy 
form; and (2) between 100 and 120 percent of the weighted 
average benefit. Both products must include benefits 
substantially similar to other individual health insurance 
coverage offered by the issuer in the state. The weighted 
average may be either: (1) the average actuarial value of the 
benefits from individual coverage provided by the issuer; or 
(2) the average actuarial value of the benefits from individual 
coverage provided by all issuers in the state. The weighted 
average will be based on coverage provided during the previous 
year and exclude coverage of eligible individuals. Actuarial 
values will be calculated based on a standardized population 
and a set of standardized utilization and cost factors.
      Network plans may limit coverage to those who live, 
reside, or work within the service area for the network plan. 
Within the service area for the plan, the issuer may deny 
coverage to individuals if the issuer has demonstrated, if 
required, to the applicable state authority that it will not 
have the capacity to deliver services adequately to additional 
individual enrollees. Denial must be made uniformly to 
individuals without regard to any health status-related factor 
and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible 
individuals. Upon denial, the issuer may not offer coverage in 
the individual market within the service area for 180 days. 
Similar rules apply for financial capacity limits.

                         D. Guaranteed renewal

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would require that individual coverage is 
renewable at the option of the individual except for: 
nonpayment; fraud; termination of all individual coverage by 
the insurer or HMO, or termination of coverage in a geographic 
area in the case of network or HMO plans; movement of the 
individual outside the insurer's service area; termination of 
the particular type of coverage by the insurer or HMO, after 
the insurer has provided 90 day notice, offered the option to 
purchase any other coverage, and acted without regard to health 
status or insurability; discontinuation of all individual 
coverage by the insurer or HMO, after 180 days notice; uniform 
modification of all health plans within the individual's type 
of coverage.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would require that individual 
coverage is renewable at the option of the individual except 
for: nonpayment; fraud; termination of the particular type of 
coverage by the insurer or HMO, which has provided 90 day 
notice, offered the option to purchase any other coverage, and 
acted without regard to health status or insurability; 
termination of all individual coverage by the insurer or HMO, 
after 180 days notice, and prohibition against market re-entry 
for 5 years; change such that the individual lives or works 
outside the insurer's service area but only if denial of 
coverage is applied uniformly without regard to the health 
status or insurability of the individual.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that a health insurance 
issuer that provides individual health insurance coverage to an 
individual must renew or continue in force such coverage at the 
option of the individual. It provides exceptions to the 
guaranteed renewability requirement for one or more of the 
following: (1) nonpayment of premiums or untimely payment; (2) 
fraud; (3) termination of coverage in the market (as outlined 
below) in accordance with applicable state law; (4) for network 
plans, the individual no longer lives, resides, or works in the 
service area of the issuer, or area for which the issuer is 
authorized to do business but only if coverage is terminated 
uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor; 
(5) for coverage made available to bona fide associations, if 
membership in the association ceases, but only if the coverage 
is terminated uniformly without regard to any health status-
related factor.
      An issuer may discontinue a particular type of coverage 
in the individual market only if the issuer: (1) provides prior 
notice to each covered individual; (2) offers each individual 
the option to purchase any other individual health insurance 
coverage offered by the issuer for individuals; and (3) acts 
uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of 
enrolled individuals or individuals who may become eligible for 
such coverage. An issuer may elect to discontinue offering all 
health insurance coverage in the individual market in a state 
only if certain conditions are met. In this case, the issuer 
could not issue coverage in the market and state involved for 5 
years. Issuers could modify the health insurance coverage for a 
policy form offered to individuals in the individual market so 
long as the modification was consistent with state law and was 
effective on a uniform basis among all individuals with that 
policy form.
      In the case of health insurance coverage that is made 
available by a health insurance issuer in the individual market 
to individuals only through one or more associations, the 
issuer would be required to meet the Act's requirements related 
to individuals.
      Health insurance issuers in the individual market must 
provide certifications of coverage in the same manner as health 
insurance issuers in the small group market.

              E. OPTIONAL STATE PROGRAMS/STATE FLEXIBILITY

                             1. In general

Current law
      No provision.
House bill.
      The House bill would provide that a state may establish 
public or private mechanisms to meet the goals of guaranteed 
availability of coverage. The chief executive officer of the 
state must notify the Secretary of HHS if the state elects to 
use state mechanisms. Under a state mechanism, a state may 
define qualified coverage as coverage with benefits not less 
than the weighted average actuarial value of the benefits 
provided by all the individual health insurance coverage 
(excluding coverage issued under this section) during the 
previous year, issued by: the insurer or HMO in the state; or 
all insurers and HMOs in the state. The state may elect to 
establish qualified coverage for all insurers and HMOs in the 
state after it has established qualified coverage for each 
insurer or HMO.
      State mechanisms could include one or more, or a 
combination of: health insurance coverage pools or programs 
authorized or established by the state; mandatory group 
conversion policies; guaranteed issue of one or more plans; or 
open enrollment by one or more insurers or HMOs. This list is 
not exclusive.
      A state with a health insurance coverage pool or risk 
pool in effect on March 12, 1996, which offers qualified 
coverage, would automatically be considered to have met the 
Federal access objectives.
      In general, states would have until July 1, 1997 to 
implement a state program. States without a regular legislative 
session between January 1, 1997 and June 30, 1997 would have a 
deadline of July 1, 1998.
Senate amendment
      Similar. The Senate Amendment would provide that a state 
may adopt alternative public or private mechanisms to provide 
access to affordable health benefits for eligible individuals. 
The Governor of the state must notify the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services that the state has adopted an alternative 
mechanism which achieves the goals of portability and 
renewability, and that the state intends to implement this 
mechanism.
      State mechanisms could include guaranteed issue, open 
enrollment by one or more health plan issuers, high-risk pools, 
mandatory conversion policies, or any combination of these 
mechanisms. A state high risk pool would meet the portability 
and renewability requirements if it is: (a) open to eligible 
individuals; (b) limits preexisting condition waiting periods; 
and (c) is consistent with premium rates and covered benefits 
in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) 
Model Health Plan for Uninsurable Individuals Act. States which 
adopt a NAIC model act, including group to individual market 
portability provisions that meet the Federal portability and 
renewability goals, would not be subject to federal rules.
      A state may notify the Secretary, within 6 months after 
enactment of this Act, that state alternate mechanism(s) would 
meet portability and renewability goals. The Secretary would 
not determine if the state mechanism meets the goals until 12 
months after the initial state notification, or January 1, 
1998, whichever is later. The Secretary would not make a 
determination until January 1, 1999 for states without 
legislative sessions within the 12 months after enactment of 
this Act.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that a state may 
implement an acceptable alternative mechanism that is designed 
to provide access to health benefits for individuals. This 
mechanism must: (1) provide a choice of health insurance 
coverage to all eligible individuals; (2) not impose any 
preexisting condition exclusions; and (3) include at least one 
policy form of coverage that is comparable to either 
comprehensive health insurance coverage offered in the 
individual market in the state or a standard option of coverage 
available under the group or individual health insurance laws 
in the state. If a state elects to implement the following 
mechanisms, the state must also meet the preceding 
requirements. These mechanisms are: (1) the NAIC Small Employer 
and Individual Health Insurance Availability Model Act (as it 
applies to individual health insurance coverage) or the 
Individual Health Insurance Portability Model Act; (2) a 
qualified high risk pool that meets certain specified 
requirements; or (3) other mechanisms that provide for risk 
adjustment, risk spreading, or a risk spreading mechanism (by 
an issuer or among issuers or policies of an issuer), or 
otherwise provide some financial subsidies for participating 
insurers or eligible individuals, or, alternatively, a 
mechanism under which each eligible individual is provided a 
choice of all individual health insurance coverage otherwise 
available.
      Examples of potential alternative mechanisms include 
health insurance coverage pools or programs, mandatory group 
conversion policies, guaranteed issue of one or more plans of 
individual health insurance coverage, or open enrollment by one 
or more health insurance issuers, or a combination of such 
mechanisms.
      A state is presumed to be implementing an acceptable 
alternative mechanism as of January 1, 1998, by not later than 
July 1, 1997, the chief executive officer of the state notifies 
the Secretary that the state has enacted any necessary 
legislation as of January 1, 1998 and provides the Secretary 
with information needed to review the mechanism and its 
implementation, or proposed implementation. The state must 
provide this information to the Secretary every 3 years to 
continue to be presumed to have an acceptable alternative 
mechanism. If a state submits notice and information after July 
1, 1997, and the Secretary makes no determination within 90 
days, the mechanism will be considered acceptable after 90 
days.

                       f. construction/preemption

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that states are not 
prevented from: (1) implementing guaranteed availability 
mechanisms before the deadline; (2) continuing state mechanisms 
that were in effect before the enactment of this Act; (3) 
offering guaranteed availability of coverage that is not 
qualifying coverage; or (4) offering guaranteed availability of 
coverage to individuals who are not qualifying individuals
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide that states are not 
required to replace or dissolve high risk pools or other 
similar state mechanisms which are designed to provide 
individuals in those states with access to health benefits.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that nothing in this 
part would prevent a state from establishing, implementing, or 
continuing in effect standards and requirements unless they 
prevent the application of a requirement in this part. Nothing 
in this part would affect or modify the provisions of section 
514 of ERISA.

     g. federal rules (fallback or in absence of state alternative)

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that the Secretary of HHS 
notify a state that federal rules would apply if: (1) the state 
has not elected to use a state mechanism; or (2) if the 
Secretary finds, after consultation with state officials, that 
the state mechanism would not meet the federal availability 
goals, and the state has had reasonable opportunity to change 
or implement a state mechanism to meet the goals.
      Federal rules would provide that each insurer or HMO 
which issues individual health insurance coverage in the state 
would have to offer qualifying coverage to qualifying 
individuals, and credit prior coverage toward any preexisting 
condition exclusion periods. In addition, no individual could 
be refused coverage based on health status. Network plans or 
HMOs could refuse coverage to individuals who did not reside or 
work in the plan's service area, or if network or financial 
capacity limits would be exceeded. Federal rules would cease to 
apply if the state implements a mechanism designed to meet the 
federal goals of availability.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide that Federal standards 
would apply if the state does not notify the Secretary of HHS 
of its intent to implement state mechanisms, or if the 
Secretary finds that the state mechanism fails to: (1) offer 
coverage to eligible individuals; (2) prohibit preexisting 
condition limitations or exclusions for benefits covered under 
previous health plans; (3) offer eligible individuals a choice 
of individual health plans, including at least one 
comprehensive plan, or a plan comparable to a standard option 
plan available under the group or individual health insurance 
laws of the state; or (4) implement a risk spreading mechanism, 
cross subsidy mechanism, risk adjustment mechanism, rating 
limitation or other mechanism designed to reduce the variation 
in costs of coverage for eligible individuals and other plans 
offered by the carrier or available in the state.
      The bill would waive the requirement for a risk spreading 
mechanism if all individual health plans available in the 
market are also available to eligible individuals.
      It would provide that if the Secretary determines that 
the state alternative mechanism fails to meet the above 
criteria, or if the state mechanism is no longer being 
implemented, the Secretary would have to notify the Governor of 
the failure to meet the goals of portability and renewability, 
and permit the state to come into compliance. Federal 
individual health plan portability rules would apply if the 
state still does not meet these criteria. Under these rules, a 
plan issuer could not, with respect to an eligible individual, 
decline to offer coverage to or deny enrollment of the 
individual or impose a limitation or exclusion of benefits, 
otherwise available under the plan, for which coverage was 
available under the group health plan or employee health 
benefit plan in which the person was previously enrolled. (This 
would not prevent a health plan issuer from establishing 
premium discounts or modifying otherwise applicable copayments 
or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health 
promotion or disease prevention.)
      Future adoptions of a state mechanism would be subject to 
the same procedures of: (1) notification of the Secretary; and 
(2) determination of satisfaction of criteria for compliance, 
except in the cases of adoption of the NAIC model or high risk 
pool.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that if the Secretary 
finds that the state mechanism is not acceptable or is no 
longer being implemented, the Secretary must notify the state 
of the preliminary determination and consequences of failure to 
implement an acceptable mechanism. The state will have a 
reasonable opportunity to modify the mechanism, or adopt a new 
mechanism. If the Secretary finds that the state mechanism is 
not acceptable, or is not being implemented, the Secretary must 
notify the state of the effective date of federal requirements 
for guaranteed availability. Each issuer would then be required 
to guarantee issue health insurance coverage to any individual, 
but could limit coverage to 2 policy forms as outlined in 
section IV(C) above. Secretarial authority would be limited to 
determinations based only on whether a state mechanism is not 
an acceptable alternative mechanism or is not being 
implemented. It is the intent of Congress that the risk 
adjustment, risk spreading, risk spreading mechanism and 
financial subsidization standards provide meaningful financial 
protection and assistance for eligible individuals, both in the 
case of a state alternative system and alternative coverage 
provided under section 2741(c).

 h. construction (premiums, market requirements, association coverage 
                             and marketing)

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that insurers or HMOs are 
free to determine the premiums for individual health insurance 
coverage under applicable state law. Insurers or HMOs which 
only insure groups or associations would not be required to 
offer individual health insurance coverage. Insurers or HMOs 
that offer conversion policies in connection with a group 
health plan would not be required to offer individual coverage. 
Insurers or HMOs that offer coverage only in connection with a 
group health plan or in connection with individuals based on 
affiliation with one or more bona fide associations would not 
be considered to be offering individual coverage.
      A state could require that insurers or HMOs offering 
individual coverage actively market this coverage.
Senate bill
      The Senate Amendment is similar but did not include a 
provision relating to associations.
Conference agreement
      Premiums that an issuer may charge an individual for 
individual health insurance coverage are not restricted by the 
conference agreement, but must comply with state law. The 
health insurance issuer may establish premium discounts or 
rebates, or modify otherwise applicable copayments or 
deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health 
promotion and disease prevention.
      Under the conference agreement, health insurance issuers 
offering health insurance coverage in connection with group 
health plans, or through one or more bona fide associations, or 
both, are not required to offer health insurance coverage in 
the individual market. A health insurance issuer offering group 
health coverage is not considered to be a health insurance 
issuer offering individual health insurance coverage solely 
because the issuer offers a conversion policy.

   i. enforcement of requirements on individual insurers, hmo's, and 
                          health plan issuers

Current law
      Under section 502 of ERISA, employee benefit plans that 
fail to comply with applicable requirements can be sued for 
relief and be subject to civil money penalties, and can be sued 
to recover any benefits due under the plan. Section 504 of 
ERISA provides the Secretary of Labor with investigative 
authority to determine whether any person is out of compliance 
with the law's requirements. Section 506 provides for 
coordination and responsibility of agencies in enforcement. 
Section 510 prohibits a health plan from discriminating against 
a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right under the 
plan.
House bill
      Noncomplying insurers and HMOs would be subject to 
enforcement through federal civil money penalties (in the same 
manner as imposed above (see item II(G)) but only in the event 
that the Secretary of HHS has determined that the state in 
which the insurer or HMO is selling coverage is not providing 
for enforcement.
Senate amendment
      Noncomplying individual health plans offered by a health 
plan issuer would be subject to state enforcement. Each state 
would require each individual health plan issued, sold, 
renewed, or offered for sale or operated in the state by a 
health plan issuer to meet the Act's standards pursuant to an 
enforcement plan filed with the Secretary of Labor. The state 
would be required to submit such information as required by the 
Secretary demonstrating effective implementation of the 
enforcement plan. In the event that the state failed to 
substantially enforce the Act's standards and requirements, the 
Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of HHS, 
would implement an enforcement plan. Issuers would then be 
subject to civil enforcement as provided under sections 502, 
504, 506 and 510 of ERISA. The Secretary of Labor could issue 
such regulations as needed to carry out this Act.
Conference agreement
      Each state may require health insurance issuers that 
issue, sell, renew, or offer health insurance coverage in the 
individual market to meet the requirements under this part with 
respect to such issuers. If a state fails to substantially 
enforce the federal requirements, the Secretary will provide 
enforcement in the same manner as in the small group market 
(see section II(G) above).

               V. Multiple Employer Pooling Arrangements

A. Clarification of duty of the Secretary of Labor to implement current 
law providing for exemptions from State regulation of multiple employer 
                          health plans (MEHPS)

Current law
      Section 3(40) of ERISA defines a multiple employer 
welfare benefit plan, or any other arrangement which offers or 
provides health benefits and meets additional criteria, (e.g., 
it must offer such benefits to the employees of 2 or more 
employers and cannot be a plan established under a collective 
bargaining agreement, a rural electric cooperative, or rural 
telephone cooperative association). Two or more trades or 
businesses, whether or not incorporated, are deemed a single 
employer and thus not a MEWA if such trades or businesses are 
within the same control group.
      Section 514 of ERISA treats fully-insured MEWAs 
differently from those that are not fully-insured (i.e., that 
are partly or fully- self-insured). With respect to a fully-
insured MEWA, a state may apply and enforce its insurance laws 
(section 514(b)(6)(A)(i)). With respect to a not-fully-insured 
MEWA, a state may apply and enforce its insurance laws so long 
as such laws or regulations are not inconsistent with ERISA 
(section 514(b)(6)(A)(ii). Section 514(b)(6)(B) provides that 
the Department of Labor (DOL) may issue an exemption from state 
law with respect to non-fully-insured MEWAs. (No such 
exemptions have been issued.)
House bill
      The House bill would add a new Part 7 (Rules Governing 
State Regulation of Multiple Employer Health Plans) to Title I 
of ERISA.
      It would define the following terms: insurer, fully-
insured, HMO, participating employer, sponsor, and state 
insurance commissioner. The House bill would define a multiple 
employer health plan as a MEWA which provides medical care and 
which is or has been exempt under section 514(b)(6)(B) of 
ERISA.
      The bill clarifies the conditions under which multiple 
employer health plans (MEHPs)--non-fully-insured multiple 
employer arrangements providing medical care--may apply for an 
exemption from certain state laws. It provides that only 
certain legitimate association health plans and other 
arrangements (described below) which are not fully insured are 
eligible for an exemption. This is accomplished by clarifying 
the duty of the Secretary of Labor to implement the provisions 
of current law section 514(b)(6)(B) to provide exemption from 
state law for MEHPS.
      The bill would establish criteria which a not fully-
insured arrangement must meet to qualify for an exemption and 
thus become a MEHP. The Secretary could grant an exemption to 
an arrangement only if: (1) a complete application has been 
filed, accompanied by the filing fee of $5,000; (2) the 
application demonstrates compliance with requirements 
established in new sections 703 and 704 described below; (3) 
the Secretary finds that the exemption is administratively 
feasible, not adverse to the interests of the individuals 
covered under it, and protective of the rights and benefits of 
the individuals covered under the arrangement, and (4) all 
other terms of the exemption are met (including financial, 
actuarial, reporting, participation, and such other 
requirements as may be specified as a condition of the 
exemption). The application must include: (1) identifying 
information about the arrangement and the states in which it 
will operate; (2) evidence that ERISA's bonding requirements 
will be met; (3) copies of all plan documents and agreements 
with service providers; (4) a funding report indicating that 
the reserve requirements of new section 705 will be met, that 
contribution rates will be adequate to cover obligations, and 
that a qualified actuary (a member in good standing of the 
American Academy of Actuaries or an actuary meeting such other 
standards the Secretary considers adequate) has issued an 
opinion with respect to the arrangement's assets, liabilities, 
and projected costs; and (5) any other information prescribed 
by the Secretary. Exempt arrangements must notify the Secretary 
of any material changes in this information at any time, must 
file annual reports with the Secretary, and must engage a 
qualified actuary.
      In addition, the bill would provide for a class exemption 
from section 514(b)(6)(B)(ii) of ERISA for large MEHPs that 
have been in operation for at least five years on the date of 
enactment. An arrangement would qualify for this class 
exemption if, in addition to all other requirements: (1) at the 
time of application for exemption; the arrangement covers at 
least 1,000 participants and beneficiaries, or has at least 
2,000 employees of eligible participating employers ; (2) a 
complete application has been filed and is pending; and (3) the 
application meets requirements established by the Secretary 
with respect to class exemptions. Class exemptions would be 
treated as having been granted with respect to the arrangement 
unless the Secretary provide appropriate notice that the 
exemption has been denied.

  1. Requirements relating to MEHP sponsors, board of trustees, plan 
                    operations, and covered persons

      The House bill would establish eligibility requirements 
for MEHPs. Applications must comply with requirements 
established by the Secretary. They must demonstrate that the 
arrangement's sponsor has been in existence for a continuous 
period of at least 5 years and is organized and maintained in 
good faith, with a constitution and by laws specifically 
starting its purpose and providing for at least annual 
meetings, as a trade association, an industry association, a 
professional association, or a chamber of commerce (or similar 
business group, including a corporation or similar organization 
that operates on a cooperative basis within the meaning of 
section 1381 of the IRC) for purposes other than that of 
obtaining or providing medical care. Also, the applicant must 
demonstrate that the sponsor is established as a permanent 
entity, has the active support of its members, and collects 
dues from its members without conditioning such on the basis of 
the health status or claims experience of plan participants or 
beneficiaries or on the basis of the member's participation in 
the MEHP.
      The bill would require that the arrangement be operated, 
pursuant to a trust agreement, by a ``board of trustees'' which 
has complete fiscal control and which is responsible for all 
operations of the arrangement. The board of trustees must 
develop rules of operation and financial control based on a 
three-year plan of operation which is adequate to carry out the 
terms of the arrangement and to meet all applicable 
requirements of the exemption and Title I of ERISA.
      With respect to covered persons, the bill would require 
that all employers who are association members be eligible for 
participation under the terms of the plan. Eligible individuals 
of such participating employers cannot be excluded from 
enrolling in the plan because of health status (as required 
under section 103 of the Act as described in item I-(B) above). 
The rules also stipulate that premium rates established under 
the plan with respect to any particular participating employer 
cannot be based on the claims experience of the particular 
employer.

              2. Additional entities eligible to be MEHPs

      In addition to the associations described above, certain 
other entities would be provided eligibility to seek an 
exemption as MEHPs under section 514(b)(6)(B). These include 
(1) franchise networks (section 703(b)), (2) certain existing 
collectively bargained arrangements which fail to meet the 
statutory exemption criteria (section 703(c)), and (3) certain 
arrangements not meeting the statutory exemption criteria for 
single employer plans (section 703(d)). (Section 709 of ERISA, 
added by section 166 of this subtitle, also makes eligible 
certain church plans electing to seek an exemption.)

                  3. Other requirements for exemption

      The House bill would require a MEHP to meet the following 
additional requirements: (1) its governing instruments must 
provide that the board of trustees serves as the named 
fiduciary and plan administrator, that the sponsor serves as 
plan sponsor, and that the reserve requirements of new section 
705 are met; (2) the contribution rates must be adequate, and 
(3) any other requirements set out in regulations by the 
Secretary of Labor must be met.

                       4. Maintenance of reserves

      The House bill would require that MEHPs establish and 
maintain reserves sufficient for unearned contributions, 
benefit liabilities incurred but not yet satisfied, and for 
which risk of loss has not been transferred, expected 
administrative costs, and any other obligations and margin for 
error recommended by the qualified actuary. The minimum 
reserves must be no less than 25% of expected incurred claims 
and expenses for the year or $400,000, whichever is greater. 
The Secretary may provide additional requirements relating to 
reserves and excess/stop loss coverage and may provide 
adjustments to the levels of reserves otherwise required to 
take into account excess/stop loss coverage or other financial 
arrangements. The bill provides for an alternative means of 
compliance in which the Secretary could permit an arrangement 
to substitute, for all or part of the requirements of this 
section, such security, guarantee, hold-harmless arrangement, 
or other financial arrangement as the Secretary of Labor 
determined to be adequate to enable the arrangement to fully 
meet its financial obligations on a timely basis.

            5. Notice requirements for voluntary termination

      The House bill would provide that, except as permitted in 
new section 707 below, a MEHP may terminate only if the board 
of trustees provides 60 days advance written notice to 
participants and beneficiaries and submits to the Secretary a 
plan providing for timely payment of all benefit obligations.

            6. Corrective actions and mandatory termination

      The House bill would require a MEHP to continue to meet 
the reserve requirements even if its exemption is no longer in 
effect. The board of trustees must quarterly determine whether 
the reserve requirements of new section 705 (as described 
above) are being met and, if they are not, must, in 
consultation with the qualified actuary, develop a plan to 
ensure compliance and report such information to the Secretary. 
In any case where a MEHP notifies the Secretary that it has 
failed to meet the reserve requirements and corrective action 
has not restored compliance, and the Secretary of Labor 
determines that the failure will result in a continuing failure 
to pay benefit obligations, the Secretary may direct the board 
to terminate the arrangement and take action needed to ensure 
that the arrangement's affairs are resolved in a manner which 
will result in timely provision of all benefits for which the 
arrangement is obligated.

                 7. Temporary application of state laws

      a. Provides for exclusion of arrangements from the small 
group market in any state upon the state's certification of 
guaranteed access to health insurance coverage in such state 
(i.e, state opt-out). Provides that a state which certifies to 
the Secretary that it provides guaranteed access to health 
coverage may deny a MEHP the right to offer coverage in the 
small group market (or otherwise regulate such MEHP with 
respect to such coverage), except as described below. The 
certification triggering the state opt-out could be in effect 
no longer than 3 years.
      A state is considered to provide such guaranteed access, 
if (1) the state certifies that at least 90% of all state 
residents are covered by a group health plan or otherwise have 
health insurance coverage, or (2) the state has, in the small 
group market, provided for guaranteed issue of at least one 
standard benefits package and for rating reforms designed to 
make health insurance coverage more affordable. In states 
without such guaranteed access, MEHPs could offer coverage in 
the small group market in the state as long as they met the 
standards set forth in Part 7 (as established by this 
subtitle).
      b. Provides for exceptions to the exclusion of MEHPs from 
state small group markets. Provides a limited exception to the 
state opt out for certain large, multi-state arrangements. The 
State opt out would not apply to new and existing MEHPs that 
meet the following criteria: (1) the sponsor operates in a 
majority of the 50 states and in at least 2 of the regions of 
the country; (2) the arrangement covers or will cover at least 
7,500 participants and beneficiaries; and (30 at the time the 
application to become a MEHP is filed, the arrangement does not 
have pending against it any enforcement action by the state. In 
addition, the state opt out would not apply in a state in which 
an arrangement meeting the MEHP standards operates on March 6, 
1996, to the extent a state enforcement action is not pending 
against such an entity at the time an application for an 
exemption is made.
      The above two exceptions do not apply to any state which, 
as of January 1, 1996, either (1) has enacted a law providing 
for guaranteed issue of fully community rated individual health 
insurance coverage offered by insurers and HMOs, or (2) 
requires insurers offering group health coverage to reimburse 
insurers offering individual coverage for losses resulting from 
their offering individual coverage on an open enrollment basis. 
Regulations may also provide for an exemption to the 
application of state law for certain single industry plans.
      c. Premium tax assessment authority with respect to new 
arrangements. Provides that a state could assess new 
association-based MEHPs (formed after March 6, 1996) 
nondiscriminatory state premium taxes set at a rate no greater 
than that applicable to any insurer or health maintenance 
organization offering health insurance coverage in the state. 
MEHPs existing as of March 6, 1996 would remain exempt from 
state premium taxes. However, if they expanded into a new 
state, the state could apply the above rule.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

               VI. State Authority Over Non-Exempt MEWAs

Current law
      Under section 514(6)(A) of ERISA, a state may apply and 
enforce state insurance laws with respect to a MEWA so long as 
the law or regulation is not inconsistent with ERISA.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that states have the 
authority under ERISA to regulate without limitation non-fully-
insured MEWAs which are not provided an exemption under new 
Part 7 of ERISA (see item V above). In other words, states can 
continue to regulate MEWAs that are not MEHPs.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

              VII. Additional MEWA and Related Provisions

     A. Clarification of treatment of single-employer arrangements

Current law
      Section 3(40) of ERISA defines a MEWA and specifies the 
conditions under which two or more trades or businesses shall 
be deemed a single employer, if such trades or businesses are 
within the same control group. Common control could not be 
based on an interest of less than 25%.
House bill
      The House bill would modify the treatment of certain 
single employer arrangements under section 3(40) of ERISA. The 
treatment of a single employer plan as being excluded from the 
definition of a MEWA (and thus from state law) is clarified by 
defining the minimum interest required for two or more entities 
to be in ``common control'' as a percentage which cannot be 
required to be greater than 25%. Also a plan would be 
considered a single employer plan if less than 25% of the 
covered employees are employed by other participating 
employers.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

    b. clarification of treatment of certain collectively-bargained 
                              arrangements

Current law
      Under section 3(40) of ERISA, a MEWA is defined not to 
include any plan or arrangement which is established or 
maintained under or pursuant to one or more agreements which 
the Secretary finds to be collective bargaining agreements, or 
by a rural electric cooperative. (No such Secretarial finding 
has ever been issued).
House bill
      The House bill would establish the conditions under which 
multiemployer and other collectively-bargained arrangements are 
exempted from the MEWA definition, and thus exempt from state 
law. Amends the definition of a MEWA to exclude a plan or 
arrangement which is established or maintained under or 
pursuant to a collective bargaining arrangement (as described 
in the National Labor Relations Act, the Railway Labor Act, and 
similar state public employee relations laws). It then 
specifies additional conditions which must be met for such a 
plan to be a statutorily excluded collectively bargained 
arrangement and thus not a MEWA.
      These conditions include: (1) The plan cannot utilize the 
services of any licensed insurance agent or broker to solicit 
or enroll employers or pay a commission or other form of 
compensation to certain persons that is related to the volume 
or number of employers or individuals solicited or enrolled in 
the plan; (2) a maximum 15 percent rule applies to the number 
of covered individuals in the plan who are not employees (or 
their beneficiaries) within a bargaining unit covered by any of 
the collective bargaining agreements with a participating 
employer or who are not present or former employees (or their 
beneficiaries) of sponsoring employee organizations or 
employers who are or were a party to any of the collective 
bargaining agreements (provides for a higher maximum in the 
case of certain plans or arrangements in existence as of the 
date of enactment); and (3) the employee organization or other 
entity sponsoring the plan or arrangement must certify annually 
to the Secretary the plan has met the previous requirements.
      If the plan or arrangement is not fully insured, it must 
be a multiemployer plan meeting specific requirements of the 
Labor Management Relations Act (i.e., the requirement for joint 
labor-management trusteeship under section 302(c)(5)(B)).
      If the plan or arrangement is not in effect as of the 
date of enactment, the employee organization or other entity 
sponsoring the plan or arrangement must have existed for at 
least 3 years or have been affiliated with another employee 
organization in existence for at least 3 years, or demonstrates 
to the Secretary that certain of the above requirements have 
been met.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

                      c. treatment of church plans

Current law
      Section 4(b)(2) of ERISA exempts from its requirements 
church plans that do not elect to participate in qualified 
pension plans under the IRC.
House bill
      The House bill would add a new section 709 to ERISA 
treating certain church plans (including a church, convention 
or association of churches or similar organization) as a MEWA 
and permitting such plans to voluntarily elect to apply to the 
Department of Labor for an exemption from state laws that would 
otherwise apply to a MEWA under section 514(b)(6)(B) and in 
accordance with new ERISA Part 7. An exempted church plan 
would, with certain exceptions, have to comply with the 
provisions of ERISA Title I in order to receive an exception 
from state law. The election to be covered by ERISA would be 
irrevocable. A church plan is covered under this section if the 
plan provides benefits which include medical care and some or 
all of the benefits are not fully insured. (Certain provisions 
of ERISA, such as its COBRA continuation coverage requirements, 
would not apply to the church plans described herein.)
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

              d. enforcement provisions relating to mewas

Current law
      MEWAs are subject to ERISA's enforcement and other 
provisions of title I.
House bill
      The House bill would amend ERISA to establish enforcement 
provisions relating to the multiple employer elements of the 
bill: (1) a civil penalty would apply for failure of MEWAs to 
file registration statements; (2) state enforcement would be 
authorized through Federal courts with respect to violations by 
multiple employer health plans, subject to the existence of 
enforcement agreements between the states and the federal 
government; (3) willful misrepresentation that an entity is an 
exempted MEWA or collectively-bargained arrangement could 
result in criminal penalties; (4) cease activity orders could 
be issued for arrangements found to be neither licensed, 
registered, or otherwise approved under State insurance law, or 
operating in accordance with the terms of an exemption granted 
by the Secretary under new part 7; and (5) provides that each 
MEHP require its fiduciary or board of trustees to comply with 
the required claims procedure under ERISA.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

          e. cooperation between federal and state authorities

Current law
      Section 506 of ERISA provides for coordination between 
the Department of Labor and other federal agencies in the 
enforcement of ERISA. The Secretary is authorized to use the 
facilities or services of the states, with the consent of the 
affected departments, agencies, or establishments in enforcing 
ERISA.
House bill
      The House bill would amend section 506 of ERISA to 
specify State responsibility with respect to self-insured MEHPs 
and voluntary health insurance associations (VHIAs). A State 
could enter into an agreement with the Secretary for delegation 
to the State of some or all of the Secretary's authority to 
enforce provisions of ERISA applicable to exempted MEHPs or to 
VHIAs. The Secretary would be required to enter into the 
agreement if the Secretary determined that delegation to the 
State would not result in a lower level or quality of 
enforcement. However, if the Secretary delegated authority to a 
State, the Secretary could continue to exercise such authority 
concurrently with the State. The Secretary would be required to 
provide enforcement assistance to the States with respect to 
MEWAs.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

    f. filing and disclosure requirements for mewas offering health 
                                benefits

Current law
      ERISA provides for certain reporting and disclosure 
requirements.
House bill
      The reporting and disclosure requirements of ERISA would 
be amended to require MEWAs offering health benefits to file 
with the Secretary a registration statement within 60 days 
before beginning operations (for those starting on or after 
January 1, 1997) and no later than February 15 of each year. In 
addition, MEWAs providing medical care would be required to 
issue to participating employers certain information including 
summary plan descriptions, contribution rates, and the status 
of the arrangement (whether fully-insured or an exempted self-
insured plan).
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

        g. single annual filing for all participating employers

Current law
      Section 110 of ERISA provides for alternative methods of 
compliance with reporting and disclosure requirements to those 
specified in previous sections of the law.
House bill
      This section would amend ERISA's section 110 to provide 
for a single annual filing for all participating employers of 
fully insured MEWAs.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

                  h. effective dates/transition rules

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that in general, the 
amendments made by this title would be effective January 1, 
1998. In addition, the Secretary would be required to issue all 
regulations needed to carry out the amendments before January 
1, 1998.
      The bill would provide for transition rules for self-
insured MEWAs which meet the requirements of Part 7 and which 
are in operation as of the effective date so that those 
applying to the Secretary for an exemption from State 
regulation are deemed to be excluded for a period not to exceed 
18 months unless the Secretary denies the exemption or finds 
the MEWAs application deficient, provided that the arrangement 
does not have pending against it an enforcement action by a 
state. The Secretary could revoke the exemption at any time if 
it would be detrimental to the interests of individuals covered 
under the Act.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

 VIII. Voluntary Health Insurance Associations/Health Plan Purchasing 
                          Cooperatives (HPPCs)

Current law
      While the states regulate insurance sold to purchasing 
cooperatives, a purchasing cooperative that is also a MEWA is 
also regulated under ERISA. Under ERISA, a state may apply and 
enforce its insurance laws with respect to fully-insured MEWAs.
      As of December 1995, 15 states had enacted laws relating 
to voluntary purchasing alliances/cooperatives.
House bill
      The House bill would add a new subsection (d) to section 
514 of ERISA defining under ERISA voluntary health insurance 
associations and establishing federal requirements for such 
associations. Associations meeting these requirements would be 
exempt from specific state laws.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide for limited exemptions 
from state laws for health insurance purchasing cooperatives 
that meet the requirements established by this section.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House or 
Senate provision.

                 a. definitions/nature of organization

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would define a voluntary health insurance 
association as a multiple employer welfare arrangement, 
maintained by a qualified association, under which all medical 
benefits are fully-insured, under which no employer is excluded 
as a participating employer (subject to minimum participation 
requirements of an insurer), under which the enrollment 
requirements of section 103 of the Act apply (see item II 
above), under which all health insurance coverage options are 
aggressively marketed, and under which the health insurance 
coverage is provided by an insurer or HMO to which the laws of 
the state in which it operates apply.
      A qualified association would be an association in which 
the sponsor of the association is, and has been (together with 
its immediate predecessor, if any) for a continuous period of 
not less than 5 years, organized and maintained in good faith, 
with a constitution and bylaws specifically stating its 
purpose, as a trade association, an industry association, a 
professional association, or a chamber of commerce (or similar 
business group), for substantial purposes other than that of 
obtaining or providing medical care, is established as a 
permanent entity which receives the active support of its 
members and meets at least annually, and collects dues without 
conditioning such dues on the basis of the health status or 
claims experience of plan participants or beneficiaries or on 
the basis of participation in a VHIA.
      A ``small employer'' would be defined as one who employs 
at least 2 but fewer than 51 employees on a typical business 
day in the year.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would define a ``health plan 
purchasing cooperative'' or HPPC to mean a group of employees 
or a group of individuals and employers that, on a voluntary 
basis and in accordance with this section, form a cooperative 
for the purpose of purchasing an individual health plan or 
group health plans offered by health plan issuers.
      An HPPC could not: (a) perform any activity relating to 
the licensing of health plan issuers; (b) assume financial risk 
directly or indirectly (that is, it would have to be fully-
insured); (c) establish eligibility, enrollment, or premium 
contribution requirements for individual participants or 
beneficiaries based on health status, medical condition, claims 
experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence 
of insurability, genetic information, or disability; (d) 
operate on a for-profit or other basis where the legal 
structure of the cooperative permits profits to be made and not 
returned to the members of the cooperative, or (e) perform any 
other activities that conflict or are inconsistent with the 
performance of its duties under this Act. A for-profit 
cooperative could be formed by a nonprofit organization or 
organizations in which: (1) membership in such organization is 
not based on health status, medical condition, claims 
experience, receipt of health care, medical history, evidence 
of insurability, genetic information, or disability and (2) 
that accepts as members all employers or individuals on a 
first-come, first-serve basis, subject to any established limit 
on the maximum size of an employer that may become a member.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House or 
Senate provision.

                            b. certification

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate agreement
      The Senate Amendment would provide that a state certify a 
group as a HPPC if it appropriately notifies the state and the 
Secretary of Labor that it wants to form a HPPC under the 
requirements of this section. The state would be required to 
determine in a timely fashion whether the group is in 
compliance with the section's requirements and to oversee the 
operations of the HPPC to ensure continued compliance with the 
requirements. Each certified HPPC would have to register with 
the Secretary of Labor.
      If a state failed to implement a HPPC certification 
program in accordance with this Act's standards, the Secretary 
of Labor would certify and oversee the HPPCs in that state.
      However, the Secretary would not certify a HPPC if, upon 
submission of an application of the state to the Secretary, the 
Secretary determined that a state law was in effect on the date 
of enactment of this Act providing that all small employers in 
the state had a means readily available that ensured: (a) that 
individuals and employees had a choice of multiple, 
unaffiliated health plan issuers; (b) that health plan coverage 
was subject to state premium rating requirements that were not 
based on the health and other risk factors described above and 
that contained a mandatory minimum loss ratio; (c) that 
comparative health plan materials were disseminated (including 
information about cost, quality, benefits, and other 
information); and that (d) the state program otherwise met the 
objectives of this Act.
      A HPPC operating in more than one state would be 
certified by the state in which the cooperative was domiciled. 
States could enter into cooperative agreements for the purpose 
of overseeing a HPPC's operation. A HPPC would be considered to 
be domiciled in the state in which most of the members of the 
HPPC reside.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

           c. structure and responsibilities of organization

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that VHIAs and qualified 
associations meet certain conditions (described in items 
VIII(A) and VIII(D)) to qualify as a VHIA and therefore for 
exemption from state insurance laws.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide for the following 
requirements for HPPCs:
      I. Board of Directors.--Requires each HPPC to be governed 
by a board of directors that would be responsible for ensuring 
the performance of the HPPC. The board would have to be 
composed of a cross-section of representatives of employers, 
employees, and individuals participating in the HPPC. The board 
members could not be compensated but could receive 
reimbursement for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in 
performing their HPPC responsibilities.
      2. Membership and marketing area.--Permits a HPPC to 
establish limits on the maximum size of employers who could 
become members and to determine whether to allow individuals to 
be members. Once membership limits were established, the HPPC 
would be required to accept all employers (or individuals) 
residing within the area served by the HPPC who met the 
membership requirements on a first-come, first-served basis, or 
on another basis established by the state to ensure equitable 
access to the HPPC.
      3. Duties and responsibilities.--Requires a HPPC to: (a) 
objectively evaluate potential health plan issuers and enter 
into agreements with multiple, unaffiliated ones, except that 
this requirement would not apply in regions, such as remote or 
frontier areas, where compliance was not possible; (b) enter 
into agreements with employers and individuals who become 
members; (c) participate in any program of risk-adjustment or 
reinsurance, or any similar program established by the state; 
(d) prepare and disseminate comparative health plan materials 
concerning the plans offered through the HPPC; (e) broadly 
solicit and actively market to all eligible employers and 
individuals residing within the service area; and (f) act as an 
ombudsman for enrollees.
      4. Permissible activities.--Permits a HPPC to perform 
other functions as needed to further the purposes of this Act, 
such as: (a) collecting and distributing premiums and 
performing other administrative functions; (b) collecting and 
analyzing surveys of satisfaction; (c) charging fees for 
membership and participation fees to issuers; (d) cooperating 
with (or accepting as members) employers who provide health 
benefits directly but only for the purpose of negotiating with 
providers; and (5) negotiating with health care providers and 
health plan issuers.
      5. Limitation on cooperative activities.--see item 
VIII(A) above.
      6. Conflict of interest.--Prohibits any individual, 
partnership, or corporation from serving on the HPPC board, 
being employed by or receiving compensation from the HPPC, or 
initiating or financing a HPPC if such individual, partnership, 
or corporation (a) fails to discharge the duties and 
responsibilities in a manner that is solely in the interest of 
the members; or (b) derives personal benefit from the sale of, 
or financial interest in, health plans, services, or products 
sold through the HPPC. However, a HPPC could contract with 
third parties to provide administrative, marketing, consultive, 
or other services.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House or 
Senate provision.

                      d. preemption of state laws

Current law
      Section 514(a) of ERISA preempts state laws relating to 
employee benefit plans. Section 514(b)(2) of ERISA provides 
that state laws apply in the case of the regulation of 
insurance.
House bill
      The House bill would amend section 514 of ERISA to 
preempt the following state laws: (1) laws that preclude an 
insurer or HMO from offering health insurance coverage under 
VHIAs; (2) laws that preclude an insurer or HMO from setting 
premium rates under a VHIA based on the claims experience of 
the VHIA (except the VHIA's premium rates could not vary on the 
basis of any particular employer's claims experience); (3) laws 
that require coverage in connection with a VHIA to include 
specific items or services of medical care or that require an 
insurer or HMO offering coverage in connection with a VHIA to 
include specific item or services consisting of medical care, 
except to the extent that such state laws prohibit an exclusion 
for a specific disease in such coverage. This preemption of 
mandated benefits would apply only with respect to those items 
and services specified in a list which would be prescribed in 
regulations by the Secretary of Labor.
      In general, states would be able to apply their laws if 
they had in place guaranteed access measures meeting certain 
conditions. A state which certified to the Secretary that it 
provided ``guaranteed access'' to health coverage could deny a 
VHIA the right to offer coverage in the small group market (or 
otherwise regulate such VHIA with respect to such coverage), 
except as described below. (The certification could not be in 
effect for more than 3 years.)
      A state would be considered to provide such guaranteed 
access, if (1) it certified that at least 90% of all state 
residents were covered by a group health plan or otherwise had 
health insurance coverage, or (2) that it had, in the small 
group market, provided for guaranteed issue of at least one 
option of coverage and for small group rating reforms designed 
to make health insurance coverage more affordable. However, an 
exception to this provision would apply for certain large, 
multi-state arrangements that demonstrated to the Secretary 
that it met the following criteria. In other words, state laws 
would not apply if: (1) the VHIA sponsor operates in a majority 
of the 50 states and in at least 2 of the regions of the 
country; (2) the arrangement covers or will cover (in the case 
of new VHIAs) at least 7,500 participants and beneficiaries; 
and (3) under the terms of the arrangement, either the 
qualified association does not exclude from membership any 
small employer in the state, or the arrangement accepts every 
small employer in the state that applies for coverage. In 
addition, state laws would not apply in a state in which a VHIA 
operated on March 6, 1996 and under the terms of the 
arrangement, either the qualified association does not exclude 
from membership any small employer in the state, or the 
arrangement accepts every small employer in the state that 
applies for coverage.
      The exemption from state laws for multistate plans and 
existing plans would not apply to any state which, as of 
January 1, 1996, either (1) had enacted a law providing for 
guaranteed issue of fully community rated individual health 
insurance coverage offered by insurers and HMOs, or (2) 
required insurers offering group health coverage to reimburse 
insurers offering individual coverage for losses resulting from 
their offering individual coverage on an open enrollment basis. 
In other words, such states could apply their insurance laws.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide that HPPCs that meet 
the requirements of this Act would be exempt from state 
fictitious group laws.
      A health plan issuer offering a group or individual 
health plan through a HPPC meeting the requirements of this Act 
would be required to comply with all otherwise applicable state 
rating requirements if the plan were to be offered outside the 
cooperative except a state would be required to permit an 
issuer to reduce its premiums negotiated with a HPPC to reflect 
savings derived from administrative costs, marketing costs, 
profit margins, economies of scale, or other factors. However, 
such premium reductions could not be based on the health 
status, demographic factors, industry type, duration, or other 
indicators of risk of HPPC members.
      Health plan issuers offering coverage through the HPPC 
would be required to comply with state mandated benefit laws. 
However, in states that have enacted laws authorizing 
alternative benefit plans for small employers, such issuers 
could offer such small employer plan through a HPPC.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House or 
Senate provision.

                        e. rules of construction

Current law
      No provision.
House bill

section should be construed to: (1) require that a state 
organize, operate, or create HPPCs; (2) otherwise establish 
HPPCs; (3) require individuals, plan sponsors, or employers to 
purchase coverage through a HPPC; (4) preempt a state from 
requiring licensure for individuals who are involved in 
directly supplying advice or selling health plans on behalf of 
a HPPC; (5) require that a HPPC be the only type of purchasing 
arrangement permitted to operate in a state; (6) confer 
authority upon a state that the state would not otherwise have 
to regulate health plan issuers or employee health benefit 
plans; (7) confer authority upon a state (or the federal 
government) that it would not otherwise have to regulate group 
purchasing arrangements, coalitions, association plans, or 
similar entities that do not desire to become a HPPC; or (8) 
except as specifically provided for above, prevent the 
application of state laws and regulations otherwise to health 
plan issuers offering coverage through a HPPC.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

                      f. enforcement through erisa

Current law
      Part 4 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA provides for 
fiduciary responsibilities, including the fiduciary duties of a 
plan sponsor and prohibited transactions; part 5 provides for 
administration and enforcement, including criminal and civil 
penalties.
House bill
      The House bill contains no specific provision (but as 
MEWAs, VHIAs would be subject to ERISA requirements including 
those related to fiduciary responsibilities and administration 
and enforcement, including enforcement of the new VHIA rules as 
added by this subtitle.)
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide that for enforcement 
purposes only, that parts 4 and 5 of subtitle B of title I of 
ERISA apply to a HPPC as if such plan were an employee benefit 
plan.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

              IX. Additional Definitions/Other Provisions

Current law
      Section 3 of ERISA defines numerous terms relating to 
pension and employee welfare benefit plans.
House bill
      The House bill:
      A. Defines the following terms: group health plan, 
including treatment of governmental and church plans, and 
defines Medicaid, medicare, and the Indian Health Service 
programs as group health plans.
      B. Incorporates specific ERISA definitions such as 
beneficiary, participant, employee, and employer.
      C. Provides additional definitions including applicable 
state authority, bona fide association, COBRA continuation 
provision, health insurance coverage, health maintenance 
organization, health status, individual health insurance 
coverage, insurer, medical care network plan, and waiting 
period.
      D. Provides for the treatment of partnerships.
      E. Provides definitions related to markets and small 
employers, including individual market, large group market, 
small employer and small group market.
Senate bill
      The Senate Amendment:
      A. Defines an employee health benefit plan to include a 
governmental or church plan. An employee health benefit plan is 
not a group health plan, individual plan, or a health plan. 
Provides different definition for group health plan.
      B. Similarly incorporates many ERISA definitions such as 
that for beneficiary, participant, employee, and employer.
      C. Defines group purchaser and health plan issuer.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement:
      A. Defines under ERISA the following terms relating to 
health insurance: health insurance coverage, health insurance 
issuer, health maintenance organization, group health insurance 
coverage, and excepted benefits. Also defines placed for 
adoption.
      B. Defines under PHS Act the following terms relating to 
health insurance: health insurance coverage, health insurance 
issuer, health maintenance organization, group health insurance 
coverage, and excepted benefits.
      C. Defines under the PHS Act: state, applicable state 
authority, state law, beneficiary, and bona fide association. 
Also, provides definitions under the PHS Act relating to 
markets and small employers for: large group market, small 
employer, and small group market.

relating to portability for: preexisting condition exclusion, 
enrollment date, late enrollee, waiting period, creditable 
coverage, and affiliation period.
      E. Defines under ERISA and the PHS Act group health plan, 
medical care, COBRA continuation provision, and health status-
related factor.
      The definition of medical care is intended to parallel 
that of the IRC using current law, and is intended to be broad 
enough to encompass the services of Christian Science 
practitioners, nurses, and sanatoriums and nursing facilities.
      F. Amends ERISA to provide for the treatment of 
partnerships.
      G. Incorporates in the PHS Act specific ERISA definitions 
such as employee, employer, beneficiary, church plan,

                           X. Effective Dates

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill, except as otherwise provided, would apply 
with respect to (a) group health plans, and health insurance 
coverage offered in connection with group health plans, for 
plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1998; (b) 
individual health insurance coverage issued, renewed, in 
effect, or operated on or after July 1, 1998. The bill would 
require the Secretaries of HHS, Treasury, and Labor to jointly 
establish rules regarding the treatment of certain coverage 
periods before the applicable effective dates, and would 
require the 3 Secretaries to issue such regulations on a timely 
basis.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment, except as otherwise provided, (a) 
with respect to group health plans, would apply to plans 
offered, sold, issued, renewed, in effect, or operated on or 
after January 1, 1997; (b) with respect to individual health 
plans, would apply to plans offered, sold, issued, renewed, in 
effect, or operated on or after the date that is 6 months after 
enactment or January 1, 1997, whichever is later; and (c) with 
respect to employee health benefit plans, would apply on the 
first day of the first plan year beginning on or after January 
1, 1997, whichever is later.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement, except as otherwise provided, 
would apply with respect to (a) group health plans, and health 
insurance coverage offered in connection with group health 
plans, for plan years beginning after July 1, 1997; (b) 
individual health insurance coverage offered, sold, issued, 
renewed, in effect, or operated after July 1, 1997. In general, 
group health plans and health plan issuers would be required to 
issue certifications of coverage for periods of coverage after 
July 1, 1996; actual certifications need not be issued before 
October 1, 1996. A special rule directs the Secretaries to 
provide for a process whereby individuals who need to establish 
creditable coverage for periods before July 1, 1996 may be 
given credit through the presentation of documents or other 
means. A special rule would apply to collective bargaining 
agreements.
      A good faith compliance provision is provided with 
respect to a transition period.

                XI. Health Coverage Availability Studies

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would require the Secretary of HHS, 
in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, representatives of 
state officials, consumers, and other representatives of 
individuals and entities that have expertise in health 
insurance and employee benefits, to conduct a three-part study 
and prepare and submit reports. (A) By January 1, 1998, the 
Secretary would be required to prepare and submit to Congress 
an evaluation of the various mechanisms used to ensure the 
availability of reasonably priced health coverage and whether 
standards that limit premium variations would further the 
purposes of this Act. (B) No later than January 1, 1999, the 
Secretary would be required to prepare and submit to Congress a 
report concerning the effectiveness of provisions of the Act 
and various state laws in ensuring the availability of 
reasonably priced health coverage. (C) No later than January 1, 
1998, the Secretary would be required to prepare and submit to 
Congress a report (1) evaluating the extent to which patients 
have direct access to, and choice of, health care providers, as 
well as the opportunity to utilize providers outside of the 
network, under the various types of coverage offered under the 
provisions of this Act; (2) evaluating the cost to the insurer 
of providing out-of-network access to providers and the 
feasibility of offering out-of-network access under all plans 
offered under this Act; and (3) evaluating the percent of 
premium used for medical care administration of the various 
types of coverage offered.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement requires the Secretary of HHS, 
in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, representatives of 
state officials, consumers, and other representatives of 
individuals and entities that have expertise in health 
insurance and employee benefits, to conduct two studies by 
January 1, 2000. The first study, on the effectiveness of 
federal and state reforms, would examine the availability of 
reasonably priced health coverage to employers purchasing group 
coverage and individuals purchasing coverage on a non-group 
basis. The second study, on access and choice, would examine 
the extent to which patients have direct access to, and choice 
of, health care providers, including specialty providers, 
within a network plan, as well as the opportunity to use 
providers outside of the network plan, under the various types 
of coverage offered under the provisions of this title. This 
study will also examine the cost and cost-effectiveness to 
health insurance issuers of providing access to out-of-network 
providers, and the potential impact of providing such access on 
the cost and quality of health insurance coverage offered under 
provisions of this title.

                   XII. Reimbursement of Telemedicine

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment would direct the Health Care 
Financing Administration (HCFA) to complete its ongoing study 
of reimbursement of all telemedicine services and submit a 
report to Congress with a proposal for reimbursement of fee-
for-service medicine by March 1, 1997. The report would be 
required to use data compiled from the current demonstration 
projects already under review and gather data from other 
ongoing telemedicine networks, and include an analysis of the 
cost of services provided via telemedicine.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement directs the HCFA to complete its 
ongoing study of Medicare reimbursement of all telemedicine 
services and submit a report to Congress on reimbursement of 
telemedicine services by March 1, 1997. The report would be 
required to use data compiled from the current demonstration 
projects already under review and gather data from other 
ongoing telemedicine networks, include an analysis of the cost 
of services provided via telemedicine, and include a proposal 
for Medicare reimbursement of telemedicine services.

             XIII. HMOs and Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)

Current law
      Under the Public Health Service Act, federally qualified 
HMOs may require enrollees to pay only nominal copayments and a 
reasonable deductible if services are obtained from an out-of-
network provider.
House bill
      No provision, but see Title III, Subtitle A on Medical 
Savings Accounts.
Senate amendment
      The PHS Act would be amended to allow federally-qualified 
HMOs, at the request of the HMO member, to charge a deductible 
to the HMO member if he or she has an MSA.
      Provides that it is the sense of the Committee on Labor 
and Human Resources that the establishment of MSAs should be 
encouraged as part of any health insurance reform legislation 
passed by the Senate through the use of tax incentives relating 
to contributions to, the income growth of, and the qualified 
use of, such accounts.
      Provides that it is the sense of the Senate that Congress 
should take measures to further the purposes of this Act, 
including any necessary changes to the Internal Revenue Code to 
encourage groups and individuals to obtain health coverage, and 
to promote access, equity, portability, affordability, and 
security of health benefits.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement amends the PHS Act to allow 
federally qualified HMOs to offer a high-deductible health plan 
as defined in the IRC. All other requirements of the federal 
HMO Act remain in effect.

   XIV. Volunteer Services Provided by Health Professionals at Free 
                                Clinics

      See report language for Title II.

                       XV. Findings; Severability

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that Congress finds: (1) 
that group health plans and health insurance coverage that 
impose preexisting conditions impact the ability of employees 
to seek employment in interstate commerce and thereby impedes 
such commerce; (2) that health insurance coverage is commercial 
in nature and is in and affects interstate commerce; (3) that 
it is a necessary and proper exercise of congressional 
authority to impose requirements on group health plans and 
health insurance coverage to promote commerce among states; and 
(4) that Congress intends however to defer to the states to the 
maximum extent practicable in carrying out requirements with 
respect to insurers and HMOs that are subject to state 
regulation, consistent with ERISA.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would provide that if any provision 
of the Act or application of a provision of the Act to any 
person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the 
remainder of the Act and the application of the provisions of 
such to any person or circumstances would not be affected.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement provides that Congress finds: 
(1) that group health plans and health insurance coverage that 
impose preexisting conditions impact the ability of employees 
to seek employment in interstate commerce and thereby impedes 
such commerce; (2) that health insurance coverage is commercial 
in nature and is in and affects interstate commerce; (3) that 
it is a necessary and proper exercise of congressional 
authority to impose requirements under this title on group 
health plans and health insurance coverage, including coverage 
offered to individuals previously covered under group health 
plans, to promote commerce among states; and (4) that Congress 
intends to defer to the states, to the maximum extent 
practicable, in carrying out such requirements with respect to 
insurers and HMOs that are subject to state regulation, 
consistent with ERISA.
      The conference agreement provides that if any provision 
of this title or application of such provision to any person or 
circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of 
this title and the application of the provisions of such to any 
person or circumstances would not be affected.

                       XVI. COBRA Clarifications

Current law
      Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
Act of 1985 (COBRA, P.L. 99-272) amends the Internal Revenue 
Code (IRC), ERISA, and the Public Health Service Act to require 
employers who provide group health plans with 20 or more 
employees to offer continuation coverage to employees and their 
dependents who experience specific qualifying events, including 
changes in job or family status. In general, when a covered 
employee experiences termination or reductions in hours of 
employment, the continued coverage of the employee and any 
qualified beneficiaries is for 18 months. For other qualifying 
events (e.g., death, divorce, legal separation, and child turns 
age of majority under the plan), the duration of coverage is 3 
years. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (P.L. 10-
239) provides that if a covered employee is determined to be 
disabled under the Social Security Act at the time in which he 
or she terminates or reduces hours of employment, then the 
employee is eligible for 29 months of continued coverage.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would amend the PHS Act, ERISA, and 
the IRC to provide for clarifications of COBRA continuation 
requirements. Provides that individuals who have disabled 
family members or who become disabled at any time during their 
coverage under an initial COBRA period (the first 18 months) be 
able to extend their coverage for the additional 11 month 
period currently available only to workers who are disabled at 
the time they lose their coverage.
      Provides that newborns and children who are placed for 
adoption may be covered immediately under a parent's COBRA 
policy.
Conference agreement
      See Title IV, Subtitle B.

            XVII. Sense of the Committee Regarding Medicare

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Committee on Labor and Human Resources notes that the 
Medicare trustees concluded in their 1995 report that: (i) the 
Medicare program is unsustainable in its present form; (ii) 
that the hospital insurance trust fund will only be able to pay 
for benefits for about 7 years and is severely out of financial 
balance in the long run; and (iii) the Public Trustees 
recommended that the problems be urgently addressed on a 
comprehensive basis including a review of the program's 
financing methods, benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms. 
The provision expresses the sense of the Committee that the 
Senate should take up measures necessary to reform the Medicare 
program, to provide increased choice for seniors, and to 
respond to the findings of the Public Trustees by protecting 
the short term solvency and long-term sustainability of the 
Medicare program.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

                XVIII. Parity for Mental Health Services

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment would prohibit an employee health 
benefit plan, or a health plan issuer offering a group health 
plan or individual health plan from imposing treatment 
limitations or financial requirements on the coverage of mental 
health services if similar requirements are not imposed on 
coverage for services for other conditions.
      It would provide for a rule of construction that the 
preceding should not be construed as prohibiting an employee 
health benefit plan or a health plan issuer offering a group or 
individual health plan from requiring preadmission screening 
prior to the authorization of services covered under the plan 
or from applying other limitations that restrict coverage for 
mental health services to those services that are medically 
necessary.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

XIX. Waiver of Foreign Country Residence With Respect to International 
                           Medical Graduates

Current law
      The Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections Act 
of 1994 provides for a waiver of the requirement that 
nonimmigrant international medical graduates entering as J 
exchange visitors return to their country of nationality for 
two years before being eligible to return to the U.S. The 
provision applies to aliens admitted to the U.S. before June 1, 
1996.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate bill
      The Senate Amendment would extend waivers for the 
requirement that nonimmigrant international medical graduates 
entering as J exchange visitors return to their country of 
nationality for two years before being eligible to return to 
the U.S. through June 1, 2002.
      It would amend provisions related to federally requested 
waivers requested by an interested U.S. agency on behalf of 
certain aliens.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

  XX. Organ and Tissue Donation Information Included With Income Tax 
                            Refund Payments

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate bill
      The Senate Amendment would require the Secretary of 
Treasury to include with any payment of a refund of individual 
income tax made during the period beginning on February 1, 1997 
through June 30, 1997, a copy of the document developed in 
consultation with the Secretary of HHS and organizations 
promoting organ and tissue donation which encourages organ and 
tissue donation. The document would also include a detachable 
organ and tissue donor card, and would urge recipients to sign 
the card, discuss organ and tissue donations with family 
members, and encourage family members to request or authorize 
organ and tissue donation if the occasion arises.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

 XXI. Sense of the Senate Regarding Adequate Health Care Coverage for 
                    all Children and Pregnant Women

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment provides that the Senate finds that 
the health care coverage of mothers and children in the United 
States is unacceptable, with more than 9.3 million children and 
500,000 expectant mothers having no health insurance, in 
addition to there being high levels of infant and maternal 
mortality and other enumerated indicators of inadequate access 
to care.
      The Senate Amendment provides that it is the sense of the 
Senate that the issue of adequate health care for our mothers 
and children is important to the future of the United States, 
and in consideration of the importance of such issue, the 
Senate should pass health care legislation that will ensure 
health care coverage for all of the United States' pregnant 
women and children.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

        XXII. Sense of the Senate Regarding Available Treatments

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate Amendment provides that it is the sense of the 
Senate that patients deserve to know the full range of 
treatments available to them and Congress should thoughtfully 
examine these issues to ensure that all patients get the care 
they deserve.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

                      XXIII. Rule of Construction

Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The House bill would provide that nothing in this title 
or any amendment made by it may be construed to require (or to 
authorize any regulation that requires) the coverage of any 
specific procedure, treatment, or service under a group health 
plan or health insurance coverage.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision, but see section III(E).

   TITLE II--PREVENTING HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE: ADMINISTRATIVE 
                SIMPLIFICATION; MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM

                   1. Fraud and abuse control program

      (Subtitle A of title II of the House bill; title V of the 
Senate amendment.)

                             I. In general

                   A. Fraud and Abuse Control Program

      (Section 201 of the House bill; section 501 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Currently, the investigation and prosecution of fraud 
related to Federal health programs is the responsibility of the 
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the FBI and the 
Department of Justice. The DHHS Office of Inspector General 
investigates Federal cases of fraud regarding Medicare, 
Medicaid, and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant 
programs and is authorized by the Secretary to impose civil 
monetary penalties and program exclusions on fraudulent 
providers. The FBI can investigate both Federal and private 
payer cases of fraud but cannot impose sanctions. Both the 
Office of Inspector General and the FBI refer investigative 
findings to the Department of Justice which may prosecute 
persons for violations of federal criminal laws. State Medicaid 
fraud control units are responsible for the investigation, 
prosecution, or referral for prosecution, of fraudulent 
activities associated with State Medicaid programs.
House bill
      The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human 
Services (acting through the Office of the Inspector General) 
and the Attorney General would be required to jointly establish 
a national health care fraud and abuse control program to 
coordinate Federal, State and local law enforcement to combat 
fraud with respect to health plans. To facilitate the 
enforcement of this fraud and abuse control program the 
Secretary and Attorney General would be authorized to conduct 
investigations, audits, evaluations and inspections relating to 
the delivery of and payment for health care, and would be 
required to arrange for the sharing of data with 
representatives of public and private third party payers. This 
program, implemented by guidelines issued by the Secretary and 
the Attorney General, would also facilitate the enforcement of 
applicable Federal statutes relating to health care fraud and 
abuse, and would provide for the provision of guidance to 
health care providers through the issuance of safe harbors, 
advisory opinions and special fraud alerts.
      The Secretary and Attorney General would consult with and 
share data with representatives of health plans. Guidelines 
issued by the Secretary and Attorney General would ensure the 
confidentiality of information furnished by health plans, 
providers and others, as well as the privacy of individuals 
receiving health care services. The Inspector General would 
retain all current authorities.
      For purposes of this section the term ``health plan'' 
means a plan or program that provides health benefits through 
insurance or otherwise. Such plans include health insurance 
policies, contracts of service benefit organizations, and 
membership agreements with health maintenance organizations or 
other prepaid health plans.
      The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account would be 
established as an expenditure account within the Federal 
Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund. Amounts equal to monies 
derived from the coordinated health care anti-fraud and abuse 
programs from the imposition of civil money penalties, fines, 
forfeitures and damages assessed in criminal, civil or 
administrative health care cases, along with any gifts or 
bequests would be transferred into the Medicare HI trust fund 
from the U.S. Treasury. There are appropriated from the HI 
trust fund to the Account such sums as the Secretary and the 
Attorney General certify are necessary to carry out certain 
functions, subject to specified limits for each fiscal year 
beginning with 1997.
      There would be appropriated from the general fund of the 
U.S. Treasury to the Fraud and Abuse Account for transfer to 
the FBI certain funds, subject to fiscal year limitations, for 
specified functions. These functions include prosecuting health 
care matters, investigations, audits of health care programs 
and operations, inspections and other evaluations, and provider 
and consumer education regarding compliance with fraud and 
abuse provisions. Specified amounts in the Account would also 
be available to carry out the Medicare Integrity Program. The 
Secretary and the Attorney General would be required to submit 
a joint annual report to Congress on the revenues and 
expenditures, and the justification for such disbursements from 
the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account.
Senate amendment
      Similar.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with an amendment adding a requirement that the Comptroller 
General submit to Congress a report for certain fiscal years 
regarding amounts deposited in the Hospital Insurance Trust 
Fund under this section. The conference agreement also includes 
a provision regarding the availability of recoveries and 
forfeitures for purposes of certain provisions of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

                     B. Medicare Integrity Program

      (Section 202 of the House bill; section 502 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Currently Medicare's program integrity functions are 
subsumed under Medicare's general administrative budget. These 
functions are performed, along with general claims processing 
functions, by insurance companies under contract with the 
Health Care Financing Administration.
House bill
      Establishes a Medicare Integrity Program under which the 
Secretary would promote the integrity of the Medicare program 
by entering into contracts with eligible private entities to 
carry out certain activities. These activities would include 
the following: (1) review of activities of providers of 
services or other individuals and entities furnishing items and 
services for which payment may be made under the Medicare 
program, including medical and utilization review and fraud 
review, (2) audit of cost reports, (3) determinations as to 
whether payment should not be, or should not have been, made by 
reason of Medicare as secondary payor provisions and recovery 
of payments that should not have been made, (4) education of 
providers of services, beneficiaries and other persons with 
respect to payment integrity and benefit quality assurance 
issues, and (5) developing and updating a list of durable 
medical equipment pursuant to section 1834(a)(15) of the Social 
Security Act. An entity is eligible to enter into a contract 
under this program if it meets certain requirements, including 
demonstrating to the Secretary that the entity's financial 
holdings, interests, or relationships will not interfere with 
its ability to perform the required functions.
Senate amendment
      Similar except for differences in applicable conflict of 
interest requirements with regard to entities eligible to enter 
into contracts under this program.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with a modification of the applicable conflict of interest 
requirements for eligible entities and assurance that current 
contractors meeting applicable requirements may compete for 
contracts on new program integrity activities.

                   c. beneficiary incentive programs

      (Section 203 of the House bill; section 503 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The Secretary would be required to provide an explanation 
of Medicare benefits with respect to each item or service for 
which payment may be made, without regard to whether a 
deductible or coinsurance may be imposed with respect to the 
item or service.
      This provision would require the Secretary, within three 
months after enactment of this bill, to establish a program to 
encourage individuals to report to the Secretary information on 
individuals and entities who are engaging or who have engaged 
in acts or omissions that constitute grounds for sanctions 
under sections 1128, 1128A, or 1128B of the Social Security 
Act, or who have otherwise engaged in fraud and abuse against 
the Medicare program. If an individual reports information to 
the Secretary under this program that serves as a basis for the 
collection by the Secretary or the Attorney General of any 
amount of at least $100 (other than amounts paid as a penalty 
under section 1128B), the Secretary may pay a portion of the 
amount collected to the individual, under procedures similar to 
those applicable under section 7623 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986.
      The Secretary would be required, within three months 
after enactment of this bill, to establish a program to 
encourage individuals to submit to the Secretary suggestions on 
methods to improve the efficiency of the Medicare program. If 
the Secretary adopts a suggestion and savings to the program 
result, the Secretary would make a payment to the individual of 
an amount the Secretary considers appropriate.
Senate amendment
      Identical.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

  d. application of certain health anti-fraud and abuse sanctions to 
          fraud and abuse against federal health care programs

      (Section 204 of the House bill; section 504 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Section 1128B provides for certain criminal penalties for 
convictions of Medicare and Medicaid (and certain other state 
health care programs) program-related fraud.
House bill
      This provision would extend certain criminal penalties 
for fraud and abuse violations under the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs to similar violations in Federal health care programs 
generally. The term ``Federal health care program'' would mean 
any plan or program that provides health benefits, whether 
directly, through insurance, or otherwise which is funded 
directly, in whole or in part by the United States Government 
(other than the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, 
Chapter 89 of Title 5 of the United States Code). The term also 
would include any state health care program, which under 
section 1128(h), includes Medicaid, the Maternal and Child 
Health Services Block Grant Program and the Social Services 
Block Grant Program.
Senate amendment
      Identical.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

   e. guidance regarding application of health care fraud and abuse 
                               sanctions

      (Section 205 of House bill, section 505 of Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      The 1987 Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program 
Protection Act specified various payment practices which, 
although potentially capable of including referrals of business 
under Medicare or State health care programs, are protected 
from criminal prosecution or civil sanction under the anti-
kickback provisions of the law. The 1987 law also established 
authority for the Secretary to promulgate regulations 
specifying additional payment practices, known as ``safe 
harbors,'' which will not be subject to sanctions under the 
fraud and abuse provisions.
House bill
      The Secretary would publish an annual notice in the 
Federal Register soliciting proposals for modifications to 
existing safe harbors and new safe harbors. After considering 
such proposals the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney 
General, would issue final rules modifying existing safe 
harbors and establishing new safe harbors, as appropriate. The 
Inspector General would submit an annual report to Congress 
describing the proposals received, as well as the action taken 
regarding the proposals. The Secretary, in considering 
proposals, may consider a number of factors including the 
extent to which the proposals would affect access to health 
care services, quality of care services, patient freedom of 
choice among health care providers, competition among health 
care providers, ability of health care facilities to provide 
services in medically underserved areas or to medically 
underserved populations, and the like.
      The Secretary of Health and Human Services would publish 
the first notice in the Federal Register soliciting proposals 
for new or modified safe harbors no later than January 1, 1997.
      The Secretary would issue written advisory opinions 
regarding what constitutes prohibited remuneration under 
section 1128B(b), whether an arrangement or proposed 
arrangement satisfies the criteria for activities which do not 
result in prohibited remuneration, what constitutes an 
inducement to reduce or limit services to individuals entitled 
to benefits, and, whether an activity constitutes grounds for 
the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions under sections 
1128, 1128A or 1128B. Advisory opinions would be binding as to 
the Secretary and the party requesting the opinion.
      Any person would be able to request the Inspector General 
to issue a special fraud alert informing the public of 
practices which the Inspector General considers to be suspect 
or of particular concern under the Medicare program or a State 
health care program, as defined in section 1128(h) of the 
Social Security Act. After investigation of the subject matter 
of the request, and, if appropriate, the Inspector General 
would issue a special fraud alert in response to the request, 
published in the Federal Register.
Senate amendment
      Identical to the House bill provisions regarding the 
issuance of safe harbors and special fraud alerts. However, 
provides for the issuance of ``interpretative rulings'' instead 
of ``advisory opinions'' by the Secretary.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with modifications to the advisory opinion provisions. The 
Secretary will be required to issue to a party requesting an 
advisory opinion within 60 days and the advisory opinion 
provisions will apply to requests made for opinions on or after 
the date which is 6 months after the date of enactment of this 
section and before the date which is 4 years after such date of 
enactment.

         II. Revision to Current Sanctions for Fraud and Abuse

      (Subtitle B of the House bill; subtitle B of the Senate 
amendment.)

A. Mandatory Exclusion from Participation in Medicare and State Health 
                             Care Programs

      (Section 211 of the House bill; section 511 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Section 1128 of the Social Security Act authorizes the 
Secretary to impose mandatory and permissive exclusions of 
individuals and entities from participation in the Medicare 
program, Medicaid program and programs receiving funds under 
the Maternal and Child Health Service Block Grant, or the 
Social Services Block Grant. Mandatory exclusions are 
authorized for convictions of criminal offenses related to the 
delivery of health care services under Medicare and State 
health care programs, as well as for convictions relating to 
patient abuse in connection with the delivery of a health care 
item or service. In the case of an exclusion under the 
mandatory exclusion authority the minimum period of exclusion 
could be no less than 5 years, with certain exceptions. 
Permissive exclusions are authorized for a number of offenses 
relating to fraud, kickbacks, obstruction of an investigation, 
and controlled substances, and activities relating to license 
revocations or suspensions, claims for excessive charges or 
unnecessary services, and the like. There are no specified 
minimum periods of exclusion under the permissive exclusion 
authority.
      Under Section 1128A of the Social Security Act civil 
monetary penalties may be imposed for false and fraudulent 
claims for reimbursement under the Medicare and State health 
care programs.
      Under section 1128B, upon conviction of a program-related 
felony, an individual may be fined not more than $25,000 or 
imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.
House bill
      The provision would require the Secretary to exclude 
individuals and entities from Medicare and State health care 
programs who have been convicted of felony offenses relating to 
health care fraud for a minimum five year period. The Secretary 
would also retain the discretionary authority to exclude 
individuals from Medicare and State health care programs who 
have been convicted of misdemeanor criminal health care fraud 
offenses, or who have been convicted of a criminal offense 
relating to fraud, theft, embezzlement, breach of fiduciary 
responsibility, or other financial misconduct in programs 
(other than health care programs) funded in whole or part by 
any Federal, State or local agency.
      The Secretary would also be required to exclude 
individuals and entities from Medicare and State health care 
programs who have been convicted of felony offenses relating to 
controlled substances for a minimum five year period. The 
Secretary would retain the discretionary authority to exclude 
individuals from Medicare and State health care programs who 
have been convicted of misdemeanor offenses relating to 
controlled substances.
Senate amendment
      Identical.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

B. Establishment of Minimum Period of Exclusion for Certain Individuals 
       and Entities Subject to Permissive Exclusion from Medicare

      (Section 212 of the House bill; section 512 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      See above.
House bill
      This section would establish a minimum period of 
exclusion for certain permissive exclusions from participation 
in Medicare and State health care programs.
      For convictions of misdemeanor criminal health care fraud 
offenses, criminal offenses relating to fraud in non-health 
care Federal or State programs, convictions relating to 
obstruction of an investigation of health care fraud offenses, 
and convictions of misdemeanor offenses relating to controlled 
substances, the minimum period of exclusion would be three 
years, unless the Secretary determines that a longer or shorter 
period is appropriate, due to aggravating or mitigating 
circumstances.
      For permissive exclusions from Medicare or State health 
care programs due to the revocation or suspension of a health 
care license of an individual or entity, the minimum period of 
exclusion would not be less than the period during which the 
individual's or entity's license was revoked or suspended.
      For permissive exclusions from Medicare or State health 
care programs due to exclusion from any Federal health care 
program or State health care program for reasons bearing on an 
individual's or entity's professional competence of financial 
integrity, the minimum period of exclusion would not be less 
than the period the individual or entity is excluded or 
suspended from a Federal or State health care program.
      For permissive exclusions from Medicare or State health 
care programs due to a determination by the Secretary that an 
individual or entity has furnished items or services to 
patients substantially in excess of the needs of such patients 
or of a quality which fails to meet professionally recognized 
standards of health care, the period of exclusion would be not 
less than one year.
Senate amendment
      Identical.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

   c. permissive exclusion of Individuals with ownership or control 
                    interest in sanctioned entities

      (Section 213 of the House bill; section 513 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      See above.
House bill
      Under this provision an individual who has a direct or 
indirect ownership or control interest in a sanctioned entity 
and who knows or should know of the action constituting the 
basis for the conviction or exclusion, or who is an officer or 
managing employee of such an entity, may also be excluded from 
participation in Medicare and State health care programs by the 
Secretary if the entity has been convicted of an offense listed 
in section 1129(a) or (b)(1), (2) or (3) or otherwise excluded 
from program participation. Under this provision, the culpable 
individual would also be subject to program exclusion, even if 
not initially convicted or excluded.
Senate amendment
      Identical.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

 d. sanctions against practitioners and persons for failure to comply 
                       with statutory obligations

      (Section 214 of the House bill; section 514 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      See above.
House bill
      Under this provision the Secretary may exclude a 
practitioner or person who has failed to comply with certain 
statutory obligations relating to quality of health care for 
such period as the Secretary may prescribe, except that such 
period shall be not less than one year.
      The Secretary, in making his determination that a 
practitioner or person should be sanctioned for failure to 
comply with certain statutory obligations relating to quality 
of health care, will no longer be required to prove that the 
individual was either unwilling or unable to comply with such 
obligations.
Senate amendment
      Identical.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

e. intermediate sanctions for medicare health maintenance organizations

      (Section 215 of the House bill; section 515 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      A contract between the Secretary and a Medicare Health 
Maintenance Organization (HMO) is generally for a 1 year term, 
with an option for automatic renewal. However, the Secretary 
may terminate any such contract at any time, after reasonable 
notice and an opportunity for a hearing, if the Medicare HMO 
has failed substantially to carry out the contract, or is 
carrying out the contract in a manner inconsistent with the 
efficient and effective administration of the requirements of 
section 1876 of the Social Security Act, or if the Medicare HMO 
no longer substantially meets the statutory requirements 
contained in Section 1876(b), (c), (e) and (f).
House bill
      Under this section the Secretary may terminate a contract 
with a Medicare Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or may 
impose certain intermediate sanctions on the organization if 
the Secretary determines that the Medicare HMO has failed 
substantially to carry out the contract; is carrying out the 
contract in a manner substantially inconsistent with the 
efficient and effective administration of this section; or, if 
the Medicare HMO no longer substantially meets the statutory 
requirements contained in Section 1876(b), (c), (e) and (f) of 
the Social Security Act.
      If the basis for the determination by the Secretary that 
intermediate sanctions should be imposed on an eligible 
organization is other than that the organization has failed 
substantially to carry out its contract with the Secretary, 
then the Secretary may apply intermediate sanctions as follows: 
civil money penalties of not more than $25,000 for each 
determination if the deficiency that is the basis of the 
determination has directly adversely affected (or has the 
substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) an individual 
covered under the organization's contract; civil money 
penalties or not more than $10,000 for each week of a 
continuing violation; and suspension of enrollment of 
individuals until the Secretary is satisfied that the 
deficiency has been corrected and is not likely to recur.
      Whenever the Secretary seeks to either terminate a 
Medicare HMO contract or impose intermediate sanctions on such 
an organization, the Secretary must do so pursuant to a formal 
investigation and under compliance procedures which provide the 
organization with a reasonable opportunity to develop and 
implement a corrective action plan to correct the deficiencies 
that were the basis of the Secretary's adverse determination. 
In making a decision whether to impose sanctions the Secretary 
is required to consider aggravating factors such as whether an 
entity has a history of deficiencies or has not taken action to 
correct deficiencies the Secretary has brought to their 
attention. The Secretary's compliance procedures must also 
include notice and opportunity for a hearing (including the 
right to appeal an initial decision) before the Secretary 
imposes any sanction or terminates the contract of a Medicare 
HMO, and there must not be any unreasonable or unnecessary 
delay between the finding of a deficiency and the imposition of 
sanctions.
      Under this section each risk-sharing contract with a 
Medicare HMO must provide that the organization will maintain a 
written agreement with a utilization and quality control peer 
review organization or similar organization for quality review 
functions.
      The amendments made by this section would apply to 
contract years beginning on or after January 1, 1996.
Senate amendment
      Same as the House bill provision except specifies a 
different effective date, i.e., January 1, 1997.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision, 
but with an effective date of January 1, 1997.

  F. Additional Exception to Anti-Kickback Penalties for Risk-sharing 
                              Arrangements

      (Section 216 of the House bill; section 516 of the Senate 
amendment)
Current law
      The anti-kickback provision in section 1128B(b) contains 
several exceptions. These exceptions include discounts or other 
reductions in price obtained by a provider of services or other 
entity under Medicare or a State health care program if the 
reduction in price is properly disclosed and appropriately 
reflected in the costs claimed or charges made by the provider 
or entity under Medicare or a State health care program; any 
amount paid by an employer to an employee for employment in the 
provision of covered items or services; any amount paid by a 
vendor of goods or services to a person authorized to act as a 
purchasing agent for a group of individuals or entities under 
specified conditions; a waiver of any co-insurance under Part B 
of Medicare by a Federally qualified health care center with 
respect to an individual who qualifies for subsidized services 
under a provision of the Public Health Service Act; and any 
payment practice specified by the Secretary as a safe harbor 
exception.
House bill
      This section would add a new exception to the anti-
kickback provisions allowing remuneration between an eligible 
organization under section 1876 and an individual or entity 
providing items or services pursuant to a written agreement 
between an eligible organization under section 1876 and the 
individual or entity. Remuneration would also be allowed 
between an organization and an individual or entity if a 
written agreement places the individual or entity at 
substantial financial risk for the cost or utilization of the 
items or services which the individual or entity is obligated 
to provide. The risk arrangement may be provided through a 
withhold, capitation, incentive pool, per diem payment or other 
similar risk arrangement. This amendment would apply to acts of 
omissions occurring after January 1, 1997.
Senate amendment
      Similar. However, the House provision specifically lists 
two permissible risk arrangements, i.e., incentive pools, and 
per diem payments, which are not listed in the Senate 
provision, and the Senate provision provides for the issuance 
of regulations by the Secretary, in consultation with the 
Attorney General, to define substantial financial risk as 
necessary to protect program or patient abuse.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with modifications to the definition of allowable remuneration. 
In addition, the conference agreement adds a provision setting 
forth a negotiated rulemaking process for standards relating to 
the new exception to the anti-kickback penalties added by this 
section.

 G. Criminal Penalty for Fraudulent Disposition of Assets in Order to 
                        Obtain Medicaid Benefits

      (Section 217 of the House bill.)
Current law
      Under section 1128B, upon conviction of a program-related 
felony, an individual may be fined not more than $25,000 or 
imprisoned for not more than five years or both.
House bill
      This provision would add a new crime to the list of 
prohibited activities under section 1128B of the Social 
Security Act for cases where a person knowingly and willfully 
disposes of assets by transferring assets in order to become 
eligible for benefits under the Medicaid program, if disposing 
of the assets results in the imposition of a period of 
ineligibility.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

                          III. Data Collection

      (Subtitle C of the House bill; subtitle C of the Senate 
amendment.)

  A. Establishment of the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Data Collection 
                                program

      (Section 221 of the House bill; section 521 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The Secretary of Health and Human Services would be 
required to establish a national health care fraud and abuse 
data collection program for reporting final adverse actions 
(not including settlements in which no findings of liability 
have been made) against health care providers, suppliers, or 
practitioners.
      Each government agency and health plan would, on a 
monthly basis, report any final adverse action taken against a 
health care provider, supplier, or practitioner. Certain 
information would be included in the report, including a 
description of the acts or omissions and injuries upon which 
the final adverse action was taken. The Secretary would, 
however, protect the privacy of individuals receiving health 
care services.
      The Secretary would, by regulation, provide for 
disclosure of the information about adverse actions, upon 
request, to the health care provider, supplier, or licensed 
practitioner and provide procedures in the case of disputed 
accuracy of the information. Each government agency and health 
plan is required to report corrections of information already 
reported about any final adverse action taken against a health 
care provider, supplier, or practitioner in such form and 
manner that the Secretary prescribes by regulation.
      The information in the database would be available to 
Federal and State government agencies and health plans. The 
Secretary may approve reasonable fees for the disclosure of 
information in the data base (other than with respect to 
requests by Federal agencies). The amount of such a fee shall 
be sufficient to recover the full costs of operating the data 
base.
      No person or entity would be held liable in any civil 
action with respect to any report made as required by this 
section, unless the person or entity knows the information is 
false.
      The Secretary may impose appropriate fees on physicians 
to cover the costs of investigation and recertification 
activities with respect to the issuance of identifiers for 
physicians who furnish services for which Medicare payments are 
made.
Senate amendment
      Similar with one additional provision requiring that the 
Secretary implement this section in such a manner as to avoid 
duplication with the reporting requirements established for the 
National Practitioner Data Bank.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with a modification directing the Secretary to implement this 
section so as to avoid duplication with the reporting 
requirements of the National Practitioner Data Bank under the 
Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986.

                      IV. Civil Monetary Penalties

amendment.)

            a. social security act civil monetary penalties

      (Section 231 of the House bill; section 531 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Under Section 1128A of the Social Security Act civil 
monetary penalties may be imposed for false and fraudulent 
claims for reimbursement under the Medicare and State health 
care programs.
House bill
      The Medicare and Medicaid program provisions providing 
for civil monetary penalties for specified fraud and abuse 
violations would apply to similar violations involving other 
Federal health care programs. Federal health care programs 
would include any health insurance plans or programs funded, in 
whole or part, by the Federal government, such as CHAMPUS. 
Civil monetary penalties and assessments received by the 
Secretary would be deposited into the Health Care Fraud and 
Abuse Control Account established under this Act.
      Any person who has been excluded from participating in 
Medicare or a State health care program and who retains a 
direct or indirect ownership or control interest in an entity 
that is participating in a program under Medicare or a State 
health care program, and who knows or should know of the action 
constituting the basis for the exclusion, or who is an officer 
or managing employee of such an entity, would be subject to a 
civil monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for each day 
the prohibited relationship occurs.
      Amends the civil monetary penalty provisions of Section 
1128A(a) by increasing the amount of a civil money penalty from 
$2,000 to $10,000 for each item or service involved. Also 
increases the assessment which a person may be subject to from 
``not more than twice the amount'' to ``not more than three 
times the amount'' claimed for each such item or service in 
lieu of damages sustained by the United States or a State 
agency because of such claim.
      Adds two practices to the list of prohibited practices 
for which civil money penalties may be assessed. The first 
occurs when a person engages in a pattern or practice of 
presenting a claim for an item or service based on a code that 
the person knows or should know will result in greater payments 
than appropriate. The second is the practice whereby a person 
submits a claim or claims that the person knows or should know 
is for a medical item or service which is not medically 
necessary.
      The sanction against practitioners and persons who fail 
to comply with certain statutory obligations is changed from an 
amount equal to ``the actual or estimated cost'' of the 
medically improper or unnecessary services provided, to ``up to 
$10,000 for each instance of medically improper or unnecessary 
services provided.
      The procedural provisions outlined in Section 1128A, such 
as notice, hearings, and judicial review rights, would apply to 
civil monetary penalties assessed against Medicare Health 
Maintenance Organizations in the same manner as they apply to 
civil monetary penalties assessed against health care providers 
generally.
      This provision also adds a new practice to the list of 
prohibited practices for which civil monetary penalties could 
be assessed. Any person who offers remuneration to an 
individual eligible for benefits under Medicare or a State 
health care program that such individual knows or should know 
is likely to influence such individual to order or received 
from a particular provider, practitioner or supplier any item 
or service reimbursable under Medicare or a State health care 
program would be subject to the various civil monetary 
penalties, assessments and exclusion provisions of section 
1128A of the Social Security Act.
      The term ``remuneration'' is defined to include the 
waiver of part or all of coinsurance and deductible amounts, as 
well as transfers of items or services for free, or for other 
than fair market value. There would be exceptions to this 
definition. The waiver of part or all of coinsurance and 
deductible amounts would not be considered remuneration under 
this section if the waiver is not offered as part of any 
advertisement or solicitation, the person does not routinely 
waive coinsurence or deductible amounts, and the person either 
waives the coinsurance and deductible amounts because the 
individual is in financial need, or fails to collect the 
amounts after reasonable collection efforts, or provides for a 
permissible waiver under regulations issued by the Secretary. 
In addition, the term remuneration would not include 
differentials in coinsurance and deductible amounts as part of 
a benefit plan design if the differentials have been disclosed 
in writing to all beneficiaries, third party payors, and 
providers, and if the differentials meeting the standards 
defined in the Secretary's regulations. Remuneration would also 
not include incentives given to individuals to promote the 
delivery of preventive care under the Secretary's regulations.
      The effective date of these provisions is January 1, 
1997.
Senate amendment
      Identical.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision. 
The conferees do not intend that the language of section 231(d) 
create any new standard for coverage of a claim. The intent is 
to assure that a proper evaluation by a practitioner is 
completed and evidence of treatment need is established before 
services are delivered for which claims are submitted. The 
conferees recognize that under current law the reasonableness 
of a service provided by a non-medical practitioner, including 
a practitioner of alternative medicine, is judged by the 
application of principles particular to such non-medical health 
care professions. For example, the provision and reasonableness 
of chiropractic services under Medicare is judged by the 
application of chiropractic principles.
      There is significant concern regarding the impact of the 
anti-fraud provisions on the practice of complementary or 
alternative medicine and health care. The practice of 
complementary or alternative medical or health care practice 
itself would not constitute fraud.
      The conferees do not intend to penalize the exercise of 
medical judgment of health care treatment choices made in good 
faith and which are supported by significant evidence or held 
by a respectable minority of those providers who customarily 
provide similar methods of treatment. The Act is not intended 
to penalize providers simply because of a professional 
difference of opinion regarding diagnosis or treatment.
      A sanction is not intended for providers who submit 
claims they know will not be considered reimbursable as 
medically necessary services, but who are required to submit 
the claims because their patients need to document that 
Medicare will not reimburse the service. In submitting such 
claims, providers shall notify carriers that a claim is being 
submitted solely for purpose of seeking reimbursement from 
secondary payers.
      Moreover, the conferees intend that a penalty will be 
imposed on presentation of a claim that is false or fraudulent. 
No sanction is intended for providers who simply inform 
beneficiaries that a particular service is not covered by 
Medicare. Moreover, nothing in this section is intended to 
supersede the limitation on liability provisions established 
under Section 1879 of the Social Security Act.
      In addition, the conferees intend, with respect to 
allowable remuneration, that this provision not preclude the 
provision of items and services of nominal value, including, 
for example, refreshments, medical literature, complimentary 
local transportation services, or participation in free health 
fairs.

    B. Clarification of Level of Intent Required for Imposition of 
                               Sanctions

      (Section 232 of the House bill.)
Current law
      Civil monetary penalties may be imposed for seeking 
reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs for 
items of services not provided or for services provided by 
someone who is not a licensed physician, whose license was 
obtained through misrepresentation, or who misrepresented his 
or her qualification as a specialist, or where the claim is 
otherwise fraudulent. Civil penalties may also be sought for 
presenting a claim due for payments which are in violation of 
(1) contracts limiting payment due to assignment of a patient, 
(2) agreements with state agencies limiting permitted charges, 
(3) agreements with participating physicians or suppliers, and 
(4) agreements with providers of services. Civil monetary 
penalties may also be sought against persons who provide false 
or misleading information that could reasonably be expected to 
influence a decision to discharge a person from a hospital. A 
person is subject to these provisions if he or she presented a 
claim and he or she ``knows or should have known'' that the 
claim fell into one of the categories listed above.
House bill
      This provision adds a requirement, similar to the False 
Claims Act, that a person is subject to this provision when the 
person ``knowingly'' presents a claim that the person ``knows 
or should know'' falls into one of the prohibited categories. 
Thus, an assessment under this provision would only be made 
where a person had actual knowledge that he or she had 
submitted a claim or had provided false or misleading 
information, and where the person had actual knowledge of the 
fraudulent nature of the claim, acted in deliberate ignorance, 
or acted in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the 
information. The requirement that a person ``knowingly'' 
present a claim or ``knowingly'' make a false or misleading 
statement which influences discharge would prevent charging 
persons who inadvertently perform these acts.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision, 
but this provision has been added to the section of this bill 
entitled ``Social Security Act Civil Monetary Penalties'', 
above.

      c. penalty for false certification for home health services

      (Section 233 of the House bill.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      This provision would add an additional civil monetary 
penalty of not more than three times the amount of the 
payments, or $5,000, whichever is greater, for a physician who 
certifies that an individual meets all of Medicare's 
requirements to receive home health care while knowing that the 
individual does not meet all such requirements. This provision 
would apply to certifications made on or after the date of 
enactment of this Act.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

                      V. Revisions to Criminal Law

      (Subtitle E of the House bill; subtitle E of the Senate 
amendment.)

         a. definitions relating to federal health care offense

      (Section 241 of the House bill; section 542 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      This provision defines the term ``Federal health care 
offense'' to include violations of, or criminal conspiracies to 
violate, section 669, 1035, 1347 or 1518 of Title 18 of the 
United States Code, or section 287, 371, 664, 666, 1001, 1027, 
1341, 1343, or 1954 of this title, if the violation or 
conspiracy relates to a health care benefit program. A ``health 
care benefit program'' is any public or private plan affecting 
commerce under which any medical benefit, item or service is 
provided to any individual, and includes any individual or 
entity providing such a medical benefit, item or service for 
which payment may be made under the plan.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment defines ``Federal health care 
offense'' as a violation of, or a criminal conspiracy to 
violate section 1128B of the Social Security Act, section 1347 
of this title, and sections 287, 371, 664, 666, 669, 1001, 
1027, 1341, 1343, or 1954 of this title if the violation or 
conspiracy relates to health care fraud.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

                          b. health care fraud

      (Section 242 of the House bill; section 541 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Depending on the facts of a particular case, criminal 
penalties may be imposed on persons engaged in health care 
fraud under federal mail and wire fraud statutes, the False 
Claims Act, false statement statues, money laundering statutes, 
racketeering, and other related laws.
House bill
      Under this provision criminal penalties would be imposed 
for knowingly executing or attempting to execute a scheme or 
artifice (1) to defraud any health care benefit program; or (2) 
to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, money or 
property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any 
health care benefit program. Penalties include fines and up to 
10 years imprisonment. If the violation results in serious 
bodily injury, the person may be imprisoned up to 20 years. If 
the violation results in death, the person may be imprisoned 
for life.
Senate amendment
      Similar. However, the Senate provision provides that the 
crime be committed ``willfully'' as well as knowingly, and the 
penalties are listed as ``any term of years'' if the violation 
results in serious bodily injury. The Senate provision also 
provides that criminal fines imposed under this section be 
deposited into the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with a modification specifying that the standard of intent will 
be ``knowingly and willfully''.
      There has been significant concern regarding the impact 
of the anti-fraud provisions on the practice of complementary 
and alternative medicine and health care. The practice of 
complementary, alternative, innovative, experimental or 
investigational medical or health care itself would not 
constitute fraud. The conferees intend that this proposal not 
be interpreted as a prohibition of the practice of these types 
of medical or health care. The Act is not intended to penalize 
a person who exercises a health care treatment choice or makes 
a medical or health care judgment in good faith simply because 
there is a difference of opinion regarding the form of 
diagnosis or treatment. Nor does this provision in general 
prohibit plans from covering specific types of treatment. 
Whether certain complementary and alternative practices will be 
covered is and should be a decision left to health care plan 
administrators.

                        c. theft or embezzlement

      Section 243 of the House bill; section 546 of the Senate 
amendment)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      Criminal penalties would be imposed for embezzling, 
stealing, or otherwise without authority knowingly converting 
or intentionally misapplying any of the moneys, funds, 
securities, premiums, credits, property, or other assets of a 
health care benefit program. A person convicted under this 
provision would be subject to a fine under Title 18 of the 
United States Code, or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or 
both. If the value of property does not exceed $100, the 
defendant would be fined or imprisoned not more than one year, 
or both.
Senate amendment
      Requires that this crime be committed ``willfully'', and 
the person convicted is subject to a fine under this title or 
imprisonment of not more than 10 years, or both.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with a modification specifying that the standard of intent will 
be ``knowingly and willfully''.

                          d. false statements

      (Section 244 of the House bill; section 544 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      The Federal false statements provision at 18 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1001 generally prohibits false statements with regard to 
any matter within the jurisdiction of a Federal department or 
agency.
House bill
      Criminal penalties would be imposed for knowingly 
falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick, scheme, or 
device a material fact, or making false, fictitious, or 
fraudulent statements or representations, or making or using 
any falsewriting or document knowing the same to contain any 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry in any 
matter involving a health care benefit program. A person 
convicted under this provision may be punished by the 
imposition of fines under title 18 of the United States Code, 
or by imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both.
Senate amendment
      Contains additional elements of the crime of false 
statements, including the words ``willfully'' and 
``materially''. The House bill language specifying that the 
false statements be ``in connection with the delivery of or 
payment for health care benefits, items, or services'' does not 
appear in the Senate amendment provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with a modification specifying that the standard of intent will 
be ``knowingly and willfully''.

   e. obstruction of criminal investigations of health care offenses

      (Section 245 of the House bill; section 545 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Under current law, criminal penalties are imposed for 
obstructing, delaying or preventing the communication of 
information to law enforcement officials regarding the 
violation of criminal statues by using bribery, intimidation, 
threats, corrupt persuasion, or harassment.
House bill
      Criminal penalties would be imposed for willfully 
preventing, obstructing, misleading, delaying or attempting to 
prevent, obstruct, mislead or delay the communication of 
information or records relating to a Federal health care 
offense to a criminal investigator. A person convicted under 
this provision could be punished by the imposition of fines 
under title 18 of the United States Code or by imprisonment of 
not more than 5 years, or both. Criminal investigator would 
mean any individual duly authorized by a department, agency, or 
armed force of the United States to conduct or engage 
investigations for prosecution for violations of health care 
offenses.
Senate amendment
      Similar, with only minor drafting differences.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

                 f. laundering of monetary instruments

      (Section 246 of the House bill; section 547 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      The current Federal money laundering provision is found 
at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956(c)(7), but does not include money 
laundering as related to health care fraud.
House bill
      An act or activity constituting a Federal health care 
offense would be considered a ``specified unlawful activity'' 
for purposes of the prohibition on money laundering, so that 
any person who engages in money laundering in connection with a 
Federal health care offense would be subject to existing 
criminal penalties.
Senate amendment
      Similar, with only minor drafting differences.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

         g. injunctive relief relating to health care offenses

      (Section 247 of the House bill; section 543 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Depending on the facts of a particular case, injunctive 
relief may be imposed on persons who are committing or about to 
commit health care fraud under federal racketeering statutes 
and other related laws.
House bill
      If a person is violating or about to commit a Federal 
health care offense, the Attorney General of the United States 
could commence a civil action in any Federal court to enjoin 
such a violation. If a person is alienating or disposing of 
property or intends to alienate or dispose of property obtained 
as a result of a Federal health care offense, the Attorney 
General could seek to enjoin such alienation or disposition, or 
could seek a restraining order to prohibit the person from 
withdrawing, transferring, removing, dissipating or disposing 
of any such property or property of equivalent value and 
appoint a temporary receiver to administer such restraining 
order.
Senate amendment
      Similar.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

             h. authorized investigative demand procedures

      (Section 248 of the House bill; section 548 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      This provision would establish procedures for the 
Attorney General to make investigative demands in cases 
regarding health care fraud. Under this section, the Attorney 
General could issue a summons for records and/or a witness to 
authenticate the records.
      Administrative summons would be authorized for 
investigations of any scheme to defraud an health care benefit 
program in connection with the delivery of or payment for 
health care. This section would provide for service of a 
subpoena and enforcement of a subpoena in all United States 
courts, as well as a grant of immunity to persons responding to 
a subpoena from civil liability for disclosure of such 
information.
      The provision would also provide that health information 
about an individual that is disclosed under this section may 
not be used in, or disclosed to any person for use in any 
administrative, civil, or criminal action or investigation 
directed against the individual who is the subject of the 
information unless the action or investigation arises out of, 
and is directly related to, receipt of health care of payment 
for health care or action involving a fraudulent claim related 
to health, or if good cause is shown.
Senate amendment
      Contains additional language relating to testimony by a 
custodian of records, the production of records, witness fees, 
and administrative summons.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with an amendment to include Senate bill language relating to 
testimony by a custodian of records.

            I. Forfeitures for Federal Health Care Offenses

      (Section 249 of the House bill; section 542 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Current law
      Depending on the facts of a particular case, criminal 
forfeiture may be imposed on persons convicted under federal 
money laundering statutes, racketeering statutes, and other 
related laws.
House bill
      A court imposing a sentence on a person convicted of a 
Federal health care offense could order the person to forfeit 
all real or personal property that is derived, directly or 
indirectly, from proceeds traceable to the commission of the 
offense. After payment of the costs of asset forfeiture have 
been made, the Secretary of the Treasury would deposit into the 
Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund an amount equal to the 
net amount realized from the forfeiture of property by reason 
of a federal health care offense.
Senate amendment
      Identical.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

                     J. Relation to ERISA Authority

      (Section 250 of the House bill.)
Current law
      The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 sets 
forth comprehensive requirements for employee pension and 
welfare benefit plans, including reporting and disclosure 
requirements and fiduciary standards for trustees and 
fiduciaries; pension plans are also subject to funding, 
participation, and vesting requirements.
House bill
      The provision states that nothing in this subtitle 
(Revisions to Criminal law), shall affect the authority of the 
Secretary of Labor under section 506(b) of ERISA to detect and 
investigate civil and criminal violations related to ERISA.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

                    2. Administrative simplification

      (Sections 251 and 252 of subtitle F of title II of the 
House bill.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would provide that the purpose of the subtitle 
was to improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system, by 
encouraging the development of health information network 
through the establishment of standards and requirements for the 
electronic transmission of certain health information. Amends 
title XI of the Social Security Act by adding Part C--
Administrative Simplification.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

                             A. Definitions

      (New section 1171 of the Social Security Act.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would provide definitions for this part of the 
Act including the following: clearinghouse, code set, 
coordination of benefits, health care provider, health 
information, health plan, individually identifiable health 
information, standard, and standard setting organization.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with an amendment to exclude a definition for coordination of 
benefits and clarifies the definition of health plan.

           B. General requirements for adoption of standards

      (New section 1172 of the Social Security Act.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would require that any standard or modification 
of a standard adopted would apply to the following: (1) a 
health plan, (2) a clearinghouse, or (3) a health care 
provider, but only to the extent that the provider was 
conducting electronic transactions referred to in the bill. The 
bill would require that any standard or modification of a 
standard adopted must reduce the administrative cost of 
providing and paying for health care. The standard setting 
organization would be required to develop or modify any 
standard or modification adopted. The Secretary could adopt a 
standard or modification of a standard that was different from 
any standard developed by such organization if the different 
standard or modification was promulgated in accordance with 
rulemaking procedures and would substantially reduce 
administrative costs to providers and plans. The Secretary 
would be required to establish specifications for implementing 
each of the standards and modifications adopted. The standards 
adopted would be prohibited from requiring disclosure of trade 
secrets or confidential commercial information by a participant 
in the health information network. In complying with the 
requirements of this part, the Secretary would be required to 
rely on the recommendations of the Health Information Advisory 
Committee established by the bill, and consult with appropriate 
Federal and State agencies and private organizations.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with a modification that requires the Secretary to rely on the 
recommendations of the National Committee on Vital and Health 
Statistics. The standard-setting organization should consult 
with the National Uniform Billing Committee, the National 
Uniform Claim Committee, the Working Group for Electronic Data 
Interchange, and the American Dental Association.

      C. Standards for information transactions and data elements

      (New section 1173 of the Social Security Act.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would require the Secretary to adopt appropriate 
standards for financial and administrative transactions and 
data elements exchanged electronically that are consistent with 
the goals of improving the operation of the health care system 
and reducing administrative costs. Financial and administrative 
transactions would include claims, claims attachments, 
enrollment and disenrollment, eligibility, health care payment 
and remittance advice, premium payments, first report of 
injury, claims status, and referral certification and 
authorization. Standards adopted by the Secretary would be 
required to accommodate the needs of different types of health 
care providers.
      The Secretary would be required to adopt standards 
providing for a standard unique health identifier for each 
individual, employer, health plan, and health care provider for 
use in the health care system. The Secretary would be required 
to establish security standards that (1) take into account the 
technical capabilities of record systems to maintain health 
information, the costs of security measures, the need for 
training persons with access to health information, the value 
of audit trails in computerized record systems used, and the 
needs and capabilities of small health care providers and rural 
health care providers; and (2) ensure that a clearinghouse, if 
it is part of a larger organization, has policies and security 
procedures which isolate the activities of such service to 
prevent unauthorized access to such information by such larger 
organization. The Secretary would be required to establish 
standards and modifications to such standards regarding the 
privacy of individually identifiable health information that is 
in the health information network. The Secretary, in 
coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, would be required 
to adopt standards specifying procedures for the electronic 
transmission and authentication of signatures, compliance with 
which would be deemed to satisfy Federal and State statutory 
requirements for written signatures with respect to the 
transactions specified by the bill. This part would not be 
construed to prohibit the payment of health care services or 
health plan premiums by debit, credit, payment card or numbers, 
or other electronic means. The Secretary would be required to 
adopt standards for determining the financial liability of 
health plans when health benefits are payable under two or more 
health plans, the sequential processing of claims, and other 
data elements for individuals who have more than one health 
plan.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.
    The conferees recognize that certain uses of individually 
identifiable information are appropriate, and do not compromise 
the privacy of an individual. Examples of such use of 
information include the transfer of information when making 
referrals from primary care to specialty care, and the transfer 
of information from a health plan to an organization for the 
sole purpose of conducting health care-related research. As 
health plans and providers continue to focus on outcomes 
research and innovation, it is important that the exchange and 
aggregated use of health care data be allowed.
    The conference agreement includes a modification that this 
part would not be construed to regulate the payment of health 
care services or health care premiums by debit, credit, payment 
card or other electronic means.

                D. Timetables for adoption of standards

      (New section 1174 of the Social Security Act.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would require the Secretary to adopt standards 
relating to the transactions, data elements of health 
information, security and privacy by not later than 18 months 
after the date of enactment of the part, except that standards 
relating to claims attachments would be required to be adopted 
not later than 30 months after enactment. The Secretary would 
be required to review the adopted standards and adopt 
additional or modified standards as appropriate, but not more 
frequently than once every 6 months, except during the first 
12-month period after the standards are adopted unless the 
Secretary determines that a modification is necessary in order 
to permit compliance with the standards. The Secretary would 
also be required to ensure that procedures exist for the 
routine maintenance, testing, enhancement, and expansion of 
code sets.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with a modification that the Secretary would be required to 
adopt additional or modified standards not more frequently than 
12 months.

                            e. requirements

      (New section 1175 of the Social Security Act.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would establish that if a person desires to 
conduct a financial or administrative transaction with a health 
plan as a standard transaction, (1) the health plan may not 
refuse to conduct such transaction as a standard transaction, 
(2) the health plan may not delay such transaction, or 
otherwise adversely affect, or attempt to adversely affect, the 
person or the transaction on the grounds that the transaction 
is a standard transaction, and (3) the information transmitted 
and received in connection with the transaction would be 
required to be in a form of standard data elements for health 
information. Health plans could satisfy the transmission of 
information by directly transmitting standard data elements of 
health information, or submitting nonstandard data elements to 
a clearinghouse for processing in to standard data elements and 
transmission. Not later than 24 months after the date on which 
standard or implementation specification was adopted or 
established under this part, each person to which the standard 
applied would be required to comply with the standard or 
specification. Small health plans, determined by the Secretary, 
would be required to comply not later than 36 months after 
standards were adopted.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

    f. general penalty for failure to comply with requirements and 
                               standards

      (Section 1176 of the Social Security Act.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would require the Secretary to impose on any 
person who violates a provision under the bill a penalty of not 
more than $100 for each such violation of a specific standard 
or requirement, except that the total amount imposed on the 
person for all such violations during a calendar year would not 
exceed $25,000. A penalty would not be imposed if it was 
established that the person liable for the penalty did not 
know, and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have 
known, that such person violated the provision. A penalty would 
not be imposed if (1) the failure to comply was due to 
reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and (2) the failure 
to comply as corrected during the 30-day period beginning on 
the first date the person liable for the penalty knows, or 
would have known, that the failure to comply occurred.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement.
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

 g. wrongful disclosure of individually identifiable health information

      (New section 1177 of the Social Security Act.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would define the offense of wrongful disclosure 
of individually identifiable health information as instances 
when a person who knowingly (1) uses or causes to be used a 
unique health identifier violation of a provision in this part, 
(2) obtains individually identifiable health information 
relating to an individual in violation of a provision in this 
part, or (3) discloses individually identifiable health 
information to another person in violation of this part. A 
person committing such an offense would be required to (1) be 
fined not more than $50,000, imprisoned not more than 1 year, 
or both; (2) if the offense was committed under false 
pretenses, be fined not more than $100,000, imprisoned not more 
than 5 years, or both; and (3) if the offense was committed 
with intent to sell, transfer, or use individually identifiable 
health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or 
malicious harm, fined not more than $250,000, imprisoned not 
more than 10 years, or both.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.

                         h. effect on state law

      (New section 1178 of the Social Security Act.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would require that a provision, requirement, or 
standard provided by the bill supersede any contrary provision 
of state law, including a provision of state law that required 
medical or health plan records (including billing information) 
to be maintained or transmitted in written rather that 
electronic form. A provision under the bill would not supersede 
a contrary provision of state law if the provision of state law 
(1) was more stringent than the requirements of the bill with 
respect to privacy or individually identifiable health 
information, or (2) was a provision the Secretary determined 
was necessary to prevent fraud and abuse with respect to 
controlled substances or for other purposes.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with a modification, that the provision would not supersede a 
contrary State law only if the Secretary determines that the 
State law (1) is necessary to prevent fraud and abuse; (2) to 
ensure appropriation State regulation of insurance and health 
plans; (3) for state reporting on health care delivery or 
costs, or for other purposes; or (4) addresses controlled 
substances.
      The conference agreement also includes the requirement 
that any standard adopted under this part would not apply to 
the following: (1) the use or disclosure of information for 
authorizing, processing, clearing, settling, billing, 
transferring, collecting, or reconciling a payment for, health 
plan premiums or health care, where such payment is made by 
means of a credit, debit, or other payment card, or by an 
account, check, electronic funds transfer or other such means; 
(2) the use or disclosure of information relating to a payment 
described above for transferring receivables, resolving 
customer disputes or inquiries, auditing, supplying a statement 
to a consumer of a financial institution regarding the 
customer's account with such an institution, reporting to 
customer reporting agencies, or complying with a civil or 
criminal subpoena or a Federal or State law regulating 
financial institutions.
      The conferees do not intend to exclude the activities of 
financial institutions or their contractors from compliance 
with the standards adopted under this part if such activities 
would be subject to this part. However, conferees intend that 
this part does not apply to use or disclosure of information 
when an individual utilizes a payment system to make a payment 
for, or related to, health plan premiums or health care. For 
example, the exchange of information between participants in a 
credit card system in connection with processing a credit card 
payment for health care would not be covered by this part. 
Similarly sending a checking account statement to an 
accountholder who uses a credit or debit card to pay for health 
care services, would not be covered by this part. However, this 
part does apply if a company clears health care claims, the 
health care claims activities remain subject to the 
requirements of this part.

 1. changes in membership and duties of national committee on vital and 
                           health statistics

      (Section 253 of the House bill.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The bill would amend the membership and duties of the 
National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, authorized 
under section 306(k) of the Public Health Service Act, as 
amended, by increasing the number of members to 18. The 
committee would be required to (1) provide assistance and 
advice to the Secretary on issues related to health statistical 
and health information; health with complying with the 
requirements of the bill; (2) study the issues related to the 
adoption of uniform data standards for patient medical record 
information and electronic exchange of such information; (3) 
report to the Secretary not later than 4 years after enactment 
of the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 
1996, and annually thereafter, recommendations and legislative 
proposals for such standards and electronic exchange; and (4) 
be generally responsible for advising the Secretary and the 
Congress on the status of the future of the health information 
network. The committee would be required, not later than 1 year 
after enactment, to report to Congress, health care providers, 
health plans, and other entities using the health information 
network regarding (1) the extent to which entities using the 
network were meeting the standards adopted and working together 
to form an integrated network that meets the needs of its 
users; (2) the extent to which entities were meeting the 
privacy and security standards, and the types of penalties 
assessed for noncompliance; (3) whether the federal and state 
governments were receiving information of sufficient quality to 
meet their responsibilities; (4) any problems that exist with 
implementation of the network; and (5) the extent to which 
timetables established by under this part of the bill were 
being met.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision.
      The conference agreement also includes a requirement that 
the Secretary submit detailed recommendations on standards with 
respect to the privacy of individually identifiable health 
information not later than 12 months after enactment. The 
recommendations would be required to address at least: (1) the 
rights an individual should have relating to individually 
identifiable health information; (2) the procedures that should 
be established for the exercise of such rights; and (3) the 
uses and disclosures of such information that should be 
authorized or required. The Secretary would be required to 
consult with the Attorney General, and the National Committee 
on Vital and Health Statistics for carrying out this 
requirement. If Congress fails to enact privacy legislation, 
the Secretary is required to develop standards with respect to 
privacy of individually identifiable health information not 
later than 42 months from the date of enactment.
      The conferees recognize that industry experts are 
essential to the membership of the National Committee on Vital 
and Health Statistics. It is the conferees' intent that the 
Committee select representatives from the insurer, HMO, 
provider, employer, accreditation communities, and a 
representative from the Workgroup for Electronic Data 
Interchange (WEDI).
      The conferees recognize that technological innovation 
with respect to electronic transmission of health-care related 
transactions is progressing rapidly in the marketplace. The 
conferees do not intend to stifle innovation in this area. 
Therefore, the conferees intend that the Committee take into 
account private sector initiatives.

       3. Duplication and coordination of Medicare-related plans

      (Subtitle G of title II of the House bill.)

       a. duplication and coordination of medicare-related plans

      (Section 281 of House bill.)
Current law
      Many Medicare beneficiaries purchase private health 
insurance to supplement their Medicare coverage. These 
individually purchased policies are known as Medigap policies. 
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990, P.L. 
101-508) provided for a standardization of Medigap policies. 
OBRA also substantially modified the antiduplication provision 
contained in law. The intent of the OBRA 1990 anti-duplication 
provision was to prohibit sales of duplicative Medigap 
policies. However, the statutory language applied, with very 
limited exceptions, to all ``health insurance policies'' sold 
to Medicare beneficiaries. Observers noted that this provision 
could thus apply to a broad range of policies including 
hospital indemnity plans, dread disease policies, and long-term 
care insurance policies.
      The Social Security Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-432) 
included a number of technical modifications to the Medigap 
statute, including modifications to the anti-duplication 
provisions contained in section 1882(d)(3) of the Act. Under 
the revised language, it is illegal to sell or issue the 
following policies to Medicare beneficiaries: (i) a health 
insurance policy with knowledge that it duplicates Medicare or 
Medicaid benefits to which a beneficiary is otherwise entitled; 
(ii) a Medigap policy, with knowledge that the beneficiary 
already has a Medigap policy; or (iii) a health insurance 
policy (other than Medigap) with knowledge that it duplicates 
private health benefits to which the beneficiary is already 
entitled.
      A number of exceptions to these prohibitions are 
established. The sale of a medigap policy is not in violation 
of the provisions relating to duplication of Medicaid coverage 
if: (i) the State Medicaid program pays the premiums for the 
policy; (ii) in the case of qualified Medicare beneficiaries 
(QMBs), the policy includes prescription drug coverage; or 
(iii) the only Medicaid assistance the individual is entitled 
to is payment of Medicare Part B premiums.
      The sale of a health insurance policy (other than a 
Medigap policy) that duplicates private coverage is not 
prohibited if the policy pays benefits directly to the 
individual without regard to other coverage. Further, the sale 
of a health insurance policy (other than a Medigap policy to an 
individual entitled to Medicaid) is not in violation of the 
prohibition relating to selling of a policy duplicating 
Medicare or Medicaid, if the benefits are paid without regard 
to the duplication in coverage. This exception is conditional 
on the prominent disclosure of the extent of the duplication, 
as part of or together with, the application statement.
      P.L. 103-432 provided for the development by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) of disclosure 
statements describing the extent of duplication for each of the 
types of private health insurance policies. Statements were to 
be developed, at a minimum, for policies paying fixed cash 
benefits directly to the beneficiary and policies limiting 
benefits to specific diseases. The NAIC identified 10 types of 
health insurance policies requiring disclosure statements and 
developed statements for them. These were approved by the 
Secretary and published in the Federal Register on June 12, 
1995.
House bill
      The provision would modify the anti-duplication 
provisions. The requirement for obtaining a written application 
statement would be limited to the sale of Medigap policies to 
persons already having Medigap policies.
      Anti-duplicative provisions would specifically state that 
a policy which pays benefits to or on behalf of an individual 
without regard to other health benefit coverage would not be 
considered to duplicate any health benefits under Medicare, 
Medicaid, or a health insurance policy. Further, such policies 
would be excluded from the sales prohibitions.
      The provision would specifically state that a health 
insurance policy (or a rider to an insurance contract which is 
not a health policy) which provides benefits for long term 
care, nursing home care, home health care or community-based 
care and that coordinates or excludes against services covered 
under Medicare would not be considered duplicative, provided 
such coordination or exclusion was disclosed in the policy's 
outline of coverage.
      The provision would specify that a health insurance 
policy (which may be a contract with a health maintenance 
organization), provided to a disabled beneficiary, that is a 
replacement product for another policy that is being terminated 
by the insurer would not be considered duplicative if it 
coordinates with Medicare.
      The provision would prohibit the imposition of criminal 
or civil penalties, or taking of legal action, with respect to 
any actions which occurred between enactment of P.L. 103-432 
and enactment of this measure, provided the policies met the 
new requirements.
      The provision would prohibit States from imposing 
duplication requirements with respect to a policy (other than 
Medigap policy) or rider to an insurance contract which is not 
a health policy if the policy or rider pays benefits without 
regard to other benefits coverage or if it is a long-term care 
policy or policy sold to the disabled (as such policies are 
described above).
      The provision would also delete current language relating 
to required disclosure statements.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
with modifications. The agreement would clarify that policies 
offering only long-term care nursing home care, home health 
care, or community based care, or any combination thereof would 
be allowed to coordinate benefits with Medicare and not be 
considered duplicative, provided such coordination was 
disclosed. The conference agreement does not include the 
provision relating to replacement policies sold to disabled 
persons.
      The conference agreement would modify, rather than 
repeal, the current law requirement for disclosure statements 
for policies that pay regardless of other coverage. Disclosure 
statements, for the type of policy being applied for, would be 
furnished to a Medicare beneficiary applying for a health 
insurance policy. The statement would be furnished as a part of 
(or together with) the policy application.
      The conference agreement would specify that whoever 
issues or sells a health insurance policy to a Medicare 
beneficiary and fails to furnish the required disclosure 
statement would be fined under title 18 of the United States 
Code, or imprisoned not more than five years or both. In 
addition, or in lieu of the criminal penalty, a civil money 
penalty of $25,000 (or $15,000 in the case of someone who is 
not an issuer) could be imposed for each violation.
      The disclosure requirements would not apply to Medigap 
policies or health insurance policies identified in the July 
12, 1995 Federal Register notice (i.e. policies that do not 
duplicate Medicare (even incidentally), life insurance policies 
that contain long-term care riders or accelerated death 
benefits, disability insurance policies, property and casualty 
policies, employer and union group health plans, managed care 
organizations with Medicare contracts, and health care 
prepayment plans (HCPPs) that provide some or all of Part B 
benefits under an agreement with HCFA.)
      The conference agreement would modify existing disclosure 
statements to remove the wording that implies the policies 
duplicate Medicare coverage. New language would be substituted 
which states that: ``Some health care services paid for by 
Medicare may also trigger the payment of benefits under this 
policy''.
      The agreement would further modify the required statement 
for policies providing both nursing home and non-institutional 
coverage, nursing home benefits only, or home health care 
benefits only. The reference to Federal law would be modified 
to read: ``Federal law requires us to inform you that in 
certain situations this insurance may pay for some care also 
covered by Medicare''. All other policies would be required to 
include the following statement: ``This policy must pay 
benefits without regard to other health benefit coverage to 
which you may be entitled under Medicare or other insurance.''
      The conference agreement would further modify the 
language relating to State actions. The law would specifically 
state that nothing in the provision restricts or precludes a 
State's ability to regulate health insurance, including the 
policies subject to disclosure requirements. However, a State 
may not declare or specify, in statute, regulation, or 
otherwise, that a health insurance policy (other than a Medigap 
policy) or rider to an insurance contract which is not a health 
insurance policy that pays regardless of other coverage 
duplicates Medicare or Medigap benefits.
      The conference agreement further narrows the language 
relating to application of penalties and legal action with 
respect to non-duplication requirements during a transition 
period, defined as beginning on November 5, 1991 and ending on 
the date of enactment. No criminal or civil monetary penalty 
could be imposed for an act or omission that occurred during 
the transition period relating to policies that pay benefits 
without regard to other coverage or long-term care policies. No 
legal action could be brought or continued in any Federal or 
State court with respect to the sale of such policies insofar 
as such action includes a cause of action which arose or is 
based on action occurring during the transition period and 
relating to non-duplication requirements. This limitation on 
legal actions would be conditional on the existing disclosure 
requirements being met with respect to any policy sold during 
the period beginning on the effective date of the disclosure 
requirements required by the 1994 Act (i.e. August 11, 1995) 
and ending 30 days after enactment.
      The conference agreement further provides that the new 
disclosure rules only apply after enactment to health insurance 
policies that pay regardless of other coverage and 30-days 
after enactment to another health insurance policy.
      The conference agreement would further permit a seller or 
issuer of a health insurance policy to use current disclosure 
statements rather than the new disclosure statements.

                      4. Medical liability reform

      (Subtitle H of title II of the House bill; section 310 of 
title I of the Senate amendment.)

                         I. General Provisions

           A. Federal reform of health care liability actions

      (Section 271 of House bill.)
Current law
      There are no uniform Federal standards governing health 
care liability actions.
House bill
      (1) Applicability. The provision would provide for 
Federal reform of health care liability actions. It would apply 
to any health care liability action brought in any State or 
Federal court. The provisions would not apply to any action for 
damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death or to 
the extent that the provisions of the National Vaccine Injury 
Compensation Program apply. The provisions would also not apply 
to actions under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act.
      (2) Preemption; Effect on Sovereign Immunity. The 
provisions would preempt State law to the extent State law 
provisions were inconsistent with the new requirements. 
However, it would not preempt State law to the extent State law 
provisions were more stringent. The provision specifies that 
nothing in the preemption provision could be construed to: (i) 
waive or affect any defense of sovereign immunity asserted by 
any State under any provision of law; (ii) waive or affect any 
defense of sovereign immunity asserted by the U.S.: (iii) 
affect any provision of the Foreign Services Immunity Act of 
1976; (iv) preempt State choice-of-law rules with respect to 
claims brought by a Foreign nation or a citizen of a foreign 
nation; or (v) affect the right of any court to transfer venue 
or to apply the law of a foreign nation or to dismiss a claim 
of a foreign nation or of a citizen of a foreign nation on the 
ground of inconvenient forum.
      (3) Amount in Controversy; Federal Court Jurisdiction. 
The provision would specify that in the case of a health care 
liability action brought under section 1332 of Title 28 of the 
U.S. Code, the amount of noneconomic and punitive damages and 
attorneys fees would not be included in establishing the amount 
in controversy for purposes of establishing original 
jurisdiction. Further, the provision would specify that nothing 
in this subtitle would be construed to establish any 
jurisdiction in the U.S. district courts over health care 
liability action on the basis of Federal question grounds 
specified in section 1331 or 1337 of title 28 of the U.S. Code.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

                             b. definitions

      (Section 272 of House bill.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The provision would define the following terms for 
purposes of the Federal reforms: actual damages; alternative 
dispute resolution system; claimant; clear and convincing 
evidence; collateral source payments; drug; economic loss; 
harm; health benefit plan; health care liability action; health 
care liability claim; health care provider; health care 
service; medical device; noneconomic damages; person; product 
seller; punitive damages; and State.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

                           c. effective date

      (Section 273 of House bill.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The provision would specify that Federal reforms apply to 
any health care liability action brought in any State or 
Federal court that is initiated after the date of enactment. 
The provision would also apply to any health care liability 
claim subject to an alternative dispute resolution system, Any 
health care liability claim or action arising from an injury 
occurring prior to enactment would be governed by the statute 
of limitations in effect at the time the injury occurred.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

        II. Uniform Standards for Health Care Liability Actions

                       a. statute of limitations

      (Section 281 of House bill.)
Current law
      To date reforms of the malpractice system have occurred 
primarily at the State level and have generally involved 
changes in the rules governing tort cases. (A tort case is a 
civil action to recover damages, other than for a breach of 
contract.)
House bill
      The provision would establish a uniform statute of 
limitations. Actions could not be brought more than two years 
after the injury was discovered or reasonably should have been 
discovered. In no event could the action be brought more than 
five years after the date of the alleged injury.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

                 B. Calculation and payment of damages

      (Section 282 of House bill.)
Current bill
      No provision.
House bill
      1. Noneconomic Damages. The provision would limit 
noneconomic damages to $250,000 in a particular case. The limit 
would apply regardless of the number of persons against whom 
the action was brought or the number of actions brought.
      The provision would specify that a defendant would only 
be liable for the amount of noneconomic damages attributable to 
that defendant's proportionate share of the fault or 
responsibility for that claimant's injury.
      2. Punitive Damages. The provision would permit the award 
of punitive damages (to the extent allowed under State law) 
only if the claimant established by clear and convincing 
evidence either that the harm was the result of conduct that 
specifically intended to cause harm or the conduct manifested a 
conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of 
others. The amount of punitive damages awarded could not exceed 
$250,000 or three times the amount of economic damages, 
whichever was greater. The determination of punitive damages 
would be determined by the court and not be disclosed to the 
jury. The provision would not create a cause of action for 
punitive damages. Further, it would not preempt or supersede 
any State or Federal law to the extent that such law would 
further limit punitive damage awards.
      The provision would permit either party to request a 
separate proceeding (bifurcation) on the issue of whether 
punitive damages should be awarded and in what amount. If a 
separate proceeding was requested, evidence related only to the 
claim of punitive damages would be inadmissible in any 
proceeding to determine whether actual damages should be 
awarded.
      The provision would prohibit the award of punitive 
damages in a case where the drug or device was subject to 
premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration, unless 
there was misrepresentation or fraud. A manufacturer or product 
seller would not be held liable for punitive damages related to 
adequacy of required tamper resistant packaging unless the 
packaging or labeling was found by clear and convincing 
evidence to be substantially out of compliance with the 
regulations.
      3. Periodic Payments for Future Losses. The provision 
would permit the periodic (rather than lump sum) payment of 
future losses in excess of $50,000. The judgment of a court 
awarding periodic payments could not, in the absence of fraud, 
be reopened at any time to contest, amended, or modify the 
schedule or amount of payments. The provision would not 
preclude a lump sum settlement.
      4. Treatment of Collateral Source Payments. The provision 
would permit a defendant to introduce evidence of collateral 
source payments. Such payments are those which are any amounts 
paid or reasonably likely to be paid by health or accident 
insurance, disability coverage, workers compensation, or other 
third party sources. If such evidence was introduced, the 
claimant could introduce evidence of any amount paid or 
reasonably likely to be paid to secure the right to such 
collateral source payments. No provider of collateral source 
payments would be permitted to recover any amount against the 
claimant or against the claimant's recovery. The provision 
would apply to settlements as well as actions resolved by the 
courts.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

                   C. Alternative dispute resolution

      (Section 283 of House bill.)
Current law
      No provision.
House bill
      The provision would require that any alternative dispute 
resolution system used to resolve health care liability actions 
or claims must include provisions identical to those specified 
in the bill.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House 
provision.

                        III. Medical Volunteers

      (Section 310 of Senate bill.)
Current law
      The Federally Supported Health Centers Assistance Act of 
1992 (P.L. 102-501) provides protection from legal liability 
for certain health professionals providing services under the 
Public Health Service Act P.L. 104-73 made the provision 
permanent.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 310 of the bill would be known as the Medical 
Volunteer Act. It would provide that under certain 
circumstances a health care professional would be regarded for 
purposes of a malpractice claim to be a Federal employee for 
purposes of the Federal tort claims provisions of title 28 of 
the U.S. Code. Specifically this would occur when such 
professional provided services to a medically underserved 
person without receiving compensation for such services. The 
professional would be deemed to have provided services without 
providing compensation only if prior to furnishing services the 
professional: (i) agreed to furnish services without charge to 
any person, including any health insurance plan or program 
under which the recipient is covered; and (ii) provided the 
recipient with adequate notice (as determined by the Secretary) 
of the limited liability of the professional. These provisions 
would preempt any State law to the extent such law was 
inconsistent; they would not preempt any State law that 
provided greater incentives or protections.
      A medically underserved person would be defined as a 
person residing in either: (I) a medically underserved area as 
defined for purposes of determining a medically underserved 
population under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act; 
or (ii) a health professional shortage area as defined in 
section 332 of that Act. Further the individual would have to 
receive care in a facility substantially comparable to any of 
those designated in the Federally-Supported Health Centers Act, 
as determined in regulations of the Secretary.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the Senate provision. 
This provision extends Federal Tort Claims Act coverage to 
certain medical volunteers in free clinics in order to expand 
access to health care services to low-income individuals in 
medically underserved areas. Such coverage is currently 
provided in the Public Health Service Act to certain community 
and other health centers under the Federally Supported Health 
Centers Assistance Act. The provision tracks to the extent 
possible the provisions of that Act with respect to the 
coverage provided, quality assurance, and the process by which 
a free clinic applies to have a free clinic health professional 
deemed an employee of the Public Health Service.
      Health professionals must meet certain conditions before 
they are deemed employees of the Public Health Service Act. 
They must be licensed or certified in accordance with 
applicable law and they must be volunteers; they may not 
receive compensation for the services in the form of salary, 
fees, or third-party payments. However, they may receive 
reimbursement from the clinic for reasonable expenses, such as 
costs of transportation and the cost of supplies they provide. 
Further, the free clinic may receive a voluntary donation from 
the individual served.
      Eligible health professionals must provide qualifying 
services (i.e., otherwise available for Medicaid reimbursement) 
at a free clinic or through programs or events conducted by the 
clinic. These programs or events may include the provision of 
health services in a clinic-owned or clinic-operated mobile van 
or at a booth in a health fair. They may not include the 
provision of health services in a private physician's office 
following a referral from the free clinic. The health care 
professional or the free clinic must provide prior written 
notice of the extent of the limited liability to the 
individual. This notice should include written disclosure, 
understandable to a reasonable person, given a reasonable 
amount of time prior to the provision of services. Separate 
notice need not be provided by each professional nor prior to 
each discrete service but adequate written notice must be 
received by each individual.
      The free clinic must be licensed or certified under 
applicable law and may not impose a charge on or accept 
reimbursement from any private or public third-party payor. The 
free clinic may, however, receive voluntary donations from 
individuals receiving health care services and is not precluded 
from receiving donations, grants, contracts, or awards from 
private or public sources for the general support of the 
clinic, or for specific purposes other than for payment or 
reimbursement for a health care service.
      A free clinic must apply, consistent with the provisions 
applicable to community health centers, to have each health 
care professional ``deemed'' an employee of the Public Health 
Service Act, and therefore eligible for coverage under the 
Federal Tort Claims Act. A free clinic may not be deemed such 
an employee under this provision.
      The Committee is aware that each of the 50 states have 
passed laws to limit the liability of volunteers in a variety 
of circumstances. This provision does not preempt those laws 
beyond the preemption provided in the Federal Tort Claims Act. 
Instead, the United States shall be liable in the same manner 
and to the same extent as a private individual in the same 
circumstances under State law.
      The provision applies only to causes of action filed 
against a health professional for acts or omissions occurring 
on or after the date on which the health professional is 
determined by the Secretary to be a ``free clinic health 
professional.''
      The provision establishes for free clinics funding and 
estimating mechanisms that match to the extent possible those 
for community health centers. No funds appropriated for 
purposes of community health centers will be available to free 
clinics.

                          4. Other provisions

          I. Extension of Medicare Secondary Payer Provisions

      (Sec. 621 of Senate Amendment.)
Current law
      Generally Medicare is the ``primary payer,'' that is, it 
pays health claims first, with an individual's private or other 
public insurance filling in some or all of Medicare's coverage 
gaps. However, in certain instances, the individual's other 
coverage pays first, while Medicare is the secondary payer. 
This phenomenon is referred to as the MSP program. A group 
health plan offered by an employer (with 20 or more employees 
is required to offer workers age 65 or over (and workers 
spouses age 65 or over) the same group health insurance 
coverage as is offered to younger workers. If the worker 
accepts the coverage, the employer is the primary payer, with 
Medicare becoming the secondary payer.
      Similarly, a group health plan offered by a large 
employer (100 or more employees) is the primary payer for 
employees or their dependents who are on the Medicare 
disability program. The provision applies only to persons 
covered under the group plan because the employee is in 
``current employment status'' (i.e. is an employee or is 
treated as an employee by the employer). The MSP provision for 
the disabled population expires October 1, 1998.
      The MSP provisions apply to end-stage renal (ESRD) 
beneficiaries with employer group health plans, regardless of 
employer size. The group health plan is the primary payer for 
18 months for persons who become eligible for Medicare ESRD 
benefits. The employer's role as primary payer is limited to a 
maximum of 21 months (18 months plus the usual 3-month waiting 
period for Medicare ESRD coverage). The 18-month MSP provisions 
for the ESRD population expire October 1, 1998; at that time 
the period would revert to 12 months.
      The law authorizes a data match program which is intended 
to identify potential secondary payer situations. Medicare 
beneficiaries are matched against data contained in Social 
Security Administration (SSA) and Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) files to identify cases in which a working beneficiary 
(or working spouse) may have employer-based health insurance 
coverage. Cases of previous incorrect Medicare payments are 
identified and recoveries are attempted. The authority for the 
program extends through Sept. 30, 1998.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate Amendment
      The provision would make permanent the MSP provisions for 
the disabled and the 18-month period for the ESRD population. 
It would also make permanent the data match requirement.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
provision.

                Title III. Tax-Related Health Provisions

                      a. medical savings accounts

      (Sec. 301 of the House bill.)
Present law
      The tax treatment of health expenses depends on whether 
the individual is an employee or self employed, and whether the 
individual is covered under an employer-sponsored health plan. 
Employer contributions to a health plan for coverage for the 
employee and the employee's spouse and dependents is excludable 
from the employee's income and wages for social security tax 
purposes. Self-employed individuals are entitled to deduct 30 
percent of the amount paid for health insurance for a self-
employed individual and his or her spouse or dependents. Any 
individual who itemizes tax deductions may deduct unreimbursed 
medical expenses (including expenses for medical insurance) 
paid during the year to the extent that the total of such 
expenses exceeds 7.5 percent of the individual's adjusted gross 
income (``AGI''). Present law does not contain any special 
rules for medical savings accounts.
House bill
            In general
      Within limits, contributions to a medical savings account 
(``MSA'') are deductible if made by an eligible individual and 
are excludable from income (and wages for social security 
purposes) if made by the employer of an eligible individual. 
Earnings on amounts in an MSA are not currently taxable. 
Distributions from an MSA for medical expenses are not taxable.
            Eligible individuals
      An individual is eligible to make a deductible 
contribution to an MSA (or to have employer contributions made 
on his or her behalf) if the individual is covered under a high 
deductible health plan and is not covered under another health 
plan (other than a plan that provides certain permitted 
coverage). An individual with other coverage in addition to a 
high deductible plan is still eligible for an MSA if such other 
coverage is certain permitted insurance or is coverage (whether 
provided through insurance to otherwise) for accidents, 
disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care. 
Permitted insurance is (1) Medicare supplemental insurance; (2) 
insurance if substantially all of the coverage provided under 
such insurance relates to (a) liabilities incurred under 
worker's compensation law, (b) tort liabilities, (c) 
liabilities relating to ownership or use of property (e.g., 
auto insurance), or (d) such other similar liabilities as the 
Secretary may prescribe by regulations, (3) insurance for a 
specified disease or illness, and (4) insurance that provides a 
fixed payment for hospitalization. An individual is not 
eligible to make deductible contributions to an MSA for a year 
if any employer contributions are made to an MSA on behalf of 
the individual for the year.
            Tax treatment of and limits on contributions
      Individuals contributions to an MSA are deductible 
(within limits) in determining AGI. Employer contributions are 
excludable (within the same limits) from gross income and wages 
for employment tax purposes, except that this exclusion does 
not apply to contributions made through a cafeteria plan. The 
maximum amount of contributions that can be deducted or 
excluded for a year is equal to the lesser of (1) the 
deductible under the high deductible health plan or (2) $2,000 
in the case of single coverage and $4,000 if the high 
deductible plan covers the individual and a spouse or 
dependent. The annual limit is the sum of the limits determined 
separately for each month, based on the individual's status as 
of the first day of the month. The maximum contribution limit 
to an MSA is determined separately for each spouse in a married 
couple. In no event can the maximum contribution limit exceed 
$4,000 for a family. The dollar limits are indexed for medical 
inflation and rounded to the nearest multiple of $50.
            Definition of high deductible health plan
      A high deductible health plan is a health plan with a 
deductible of at least $1,500 in the case of single coverage 
and $3,000 in the case of coverage of more than one individual. 
These dollar limits are indexed for medical inflation, rounded 
to the nearest multiple of $50.
            Tax treatment of MSAs
      Earnings on amounts in an MSA are not currently 
includible in income.
            Taxation of distributions
      Distributions from an MSA for the medical expenses of the 
individual and his or her spouse or dependents are excludable 
from income. For this purpose, medical expenses do not include 
expenses for insurance other than long-term care insurance, 
premiums for health care continuation coverage, and premiums 
for health care coverage while an individual is receiving 
unemployment compensation under Federal or State law.
      Distributions that are not for medical expenses are 
includible in income. Such distributions are also subject to an 
additional 10-percent tax unless made after age 59\1/2\, death 
or disability.
      Upon death, if the beneficiary is the individual's 
surviving spouse, the spouse may continue the MSA as his or her 
own. Otherwise, the beneficiary must include the MSA balance in 
income in the year of death. If there is no beneficiary, the 
MSA balance is includible on the final return of the decedent. 
In any case, no estate tax applies.
            Definition of MSA
      In general, an MSA is a trust or custodial account 
created exclusively for the benefit of the account holder and 
is subject to rules similar to those applicable to individual 
retirement arrangements.
            Effective date
      Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment does not contain provisions 
providing favorable tax treatment for MSAs. However, the Senate 
amendment amends the Public Health Services Act to permit 
health maintenance organizations to charge deductibles to 
individuals with an MSA. In addition, the Senate amendment 
provides that it is the sense of the Committee on Labor and 
Human Resources that the establishment of MSAs should be 
encouraged as part of any health insurance legislation passed 
by the Senate through the use of tax incentives relating to 
contributions to, the income growth of, and the qualified use 
of, MSAs. The Senate amendment also provides that it is the 
sense of the Senate that the Congress should take measures to 
further the purposes of the Senate amendment, including any 
necessary changes to the Internal Revenue Code to encourage 
groups and individuals to obtain health coverage, and to 
promote access, equity, portability, affordability, and 
security of health benefits.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement follows the House bill, with 
modifications.
            In general
      Within limits, contributions to a medical savings account 
(``MSA'') are deductible if made by an eligible individual and 
are excludable if made by the employer of an eligible 
individual. Earnings on amounts in an MSA are not currently 
taxable. Distributions from an MSA for medical expenses are not 
taxable.
            Eligible individuals
      Beginning in 1997, MSAs are available to employees 
covered under an employer-sponsored high deductible plan of a 
small employer and self-employed individuals. An employer is a 
small employer if it employed, on average, no more than 50 
employees during either the preceding or the second preceding 
year.
      In determining whether an employer is a small employer, a 
preceding year is not taken into account unless the employer 
was in existence throughout such year. In the case of an 
employer that was not in existence through the first preceding 
year, the determination of whether the employer has no more 
than 50 employees is based on the average number of employees 
that the employer reasonably expects to employ in the current 
year. In determining the number of employees of an employer, 
employers under common control are treated as a single 
employer.
      In order for an employee of an eligible employer to be 
eligible to make MSA contributions (or to have employer 
contributions made on his or her behalf), the employee must be 
covered under an employer-sponsored high deductible health plan 
and must not be covered under any other health plan (other than 
a plan that provides certain permitted coverage). In the case 
of an employee, contributions can be made to an MSA either by 
the individual or by the individual's employer. However, an 
individual is not eligible to make contributions to an MSA for 
a year if any employer contributions are made to an MSA on 
behalf of the individual for the year.
      Similarly, in order to be eligible to make contributions 
to an MSA, a self-employed individual must be covered under a 
high deductible health plan and no other health plan (other 
than a plan that provides certain permitted coverage).
      An individual with other coverage in addition to a high 
deductible plan is still eligible for an MSA if such other 
coverage is certain permitted insurance or is coverage (whether 
provided through insurance to otherwise) for accidents, 
disability, dental care, vision care, or long-term care. 
Permitted insurance is: (1) Medicare supplemental insurance; 
(2) insurance if substantially all of the coverage provided 
under such insurance relates to (a) liabilities incurred under 
worker's compensation law, (b) tort liabilities, (c) 
liabilities relating to ownership or use of property (e.g., 
auto insurance), or (d) such other similar liabilities as the 
Secretary may prescribe by regulations, (3) insurance for a 
specified disease or illness, and (4) insurance that provides a 
fixed payment for hospitalization.
      If a small employer with an MSA plan (i.e., the employer 
or its employees made contributions to an MSA) ceases to become 
a small employer (i.e., exceeds the 50-employee limit), then 
the employer (and its employees) can continue to establish and 
make contributions to MSAs (including contributions for new 
employees and employees that did not previously have an MSA) 
until the year following the first year in which the employer 
has more than 200 employees. After that, those employees who 
had an MSA (to which individual or employer contributions were 
made in any year) can continue to make contributions (or have 
contributions made on their behalf) even if the employer has 
more than 200 employees. For example, suppose Employer A has 48 
employees in 1995 and 1996, and 205 employees in 1997 and 1998. 
A would be a small employer in 1997 and 1998 because it has 50 
or fewer employees in the preceding or the second preceding 
year. Employer A would still be considered a small employer in 
1999. However, in years after 1999, Employer A would not be 
considered a small employer (even if the number of employees 
fell to 50 or below), and in years after 1999, only employees 
who previously had MSA contributions could make new MSA 
contributions (or have employer contributions made on their 
behalf).
            Tax treatment of and limits on contributions
      Individual contributions to an MSA are deductible (within 
limits) in determining AGI (i.e., ``above the line''). In 
addition, employer contributions are excludable (within the 
same limits), except that this exclusion does not apply to 
contributions made through a cafeteria plan.
      In the case of a self-employed individual, the deduction 
cannot exceed the individual's earned income from the trade or 
business with respect to which the high deductible plan is 
established. In the case of an employee, the deduction cannot 
exceed the individual's compensation attributable to the 
employer sponsoring the high deductible plan in which the 
individual is enrolled.
      The maximum annual contribution that can be made to an 
MSA for a year is 65 percent of the deductible under the high 
deductible plan in the case of individual coverage and 75 
percent of the deductible in the case of family coverage. No 
other dollar limits on the maximum contribution apply. The 
annual contribution limit is the sum of the limits determined 
separately for each month, based on the individual's status and 
health plan coverage as of the first day of the month.
      Contributions for a year can be made until the due date 
for the individual's tax return for the year (determined 
without regard to extensions).
      In order to facilitate application of the cap on the 
number of MSA participants, described below, the employer is 
required to report employer MSA contributions, and the 
individual is required to report such employer MSA 
contributions on the individual's tax return.
            Comparability rule for employer contributions
      If an employer provides high deductible health plan 
coverage coupled with an MSA to employees and makes employer 
contributions to the MSAs, the employer must make available a 
comparable contribution on behalf of all employees with 
comparable coverage during the same period. Contributions are 
considered comparable if they are either of the same amount or 
the same percentage of the deductible under the high deductible 
plan. The comparability rule is applied separately to part-time 
employees (i.e., employees who are customarily employed for 
fewer than 30 hours per week). No restrictions are placed on 
the ability of the employer to offer different plans to 
different groups of employees.
      For example, suppose an employer maintains two high 
deductible plans, Plan A, with a deductible of $1,500 for 
individual coverage and $3,000 for family coverage, and Plan B, 
with a deductible of $2,000 for individual coverage and $4,000 
for family coverage. The employer offers an MSA contribution to 
full-time employees in Plan A of $500 for individual coverage 
and $750 for family coverage. In order to satisfy the 
comparability rule, the employer would have to offer full-time 
employees covered under Plan B one of the following MSA 
contributions: (1) $500 for employees with individual coverage 
and $750 for employees with family coverage or (2) $667 for 
employees with individual coverage and $1,000 for employees 
with family coverage. Different contributions (or no 
contributions) could be made for part-time employees covered 
under either high deductible plan.
      If employer contributions do not comply with the 
comparability rule during a period, then the employer is 
subject to an excise tax equal to 35 percent of the aggregate 
amount contributed by the employer to MSAs of the employer for 
that period. The excise tax is designed as a proxy for the 
denial of employer contributions. In the case of a failure to 
comply with the comparability rule which is due to reasonable 
cause and not to willful neglect, the Secretary may waive part 
of all of the tax imposed to the extent that the payment of the 
tax would be excessive relative to the failure involved.
      For purposes of the comparability rule, employers under 
common control are aggregated in the same manner as in 
determining whether the employer is a small employer. The 
comparability rule does not fail to be satisfied in a year if 
the employer is precluded from making contributions for all 
employees with high deductible plan coverage because the 
employer has more than 200 employees or due to operation of the 
cap during the initial 4-year period.
            Definition of high deductible plan
      A high deductible plan is a health plan with an annual 
deductible of at least $1,500 and no more than $2,250 in the 
case of individual coverage and at least $3,000 and no more 
than $4,500 in the case of family coverage. In addition, the 
maximum out-of-pocket expenses with respect to allowed costs 
(including the deductible) must be no more than $3,000 in the 
case of individual coverage and no more than $5,500 in the case 
of family coverage. Beginning after 1998, these dollar amounts 
are indexed for inflation in $50 dollar increments based on the 
consumer price index. A plan does not fail to qualify as a high 
deductible plan merely because it does not have a deductible 
for preventive care as required by State law.
      As under present law, State insurance commissions would 
have oversight over the issuance of high deductible plans 
issued in conjunction with MSAs and could impose additional 
consumer protections. It is intended that the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners (``NAIC'') will develop 
model standards for high deductible plans that individual 
States could adopt.
            Tax treatment of MSAs
      Earnings on amounts in an MSA are not currently 
includible in income.
            Taxation of distributions
      Distributions from an MSA for the medical expenses of the 
individual and his or her spouse or dependents generally are 
excludable from income. However, in any year for which a 
contribution is made to an MSA, withdrawals from an MSA 
maintained by that individual are excludable from income only 
if the individual for whom the expenses were incurred was 
eligible to make an MSA contribution at the time the expenses 
were incurred. This rule is designed to ensure that MSAs are in 
fact used in conjunction with a high deductible plan, and that 
they are not primarily used by other individuals who have 
health plans that are not high deductible plans. For example, 
suppose that, in 1997, individual A is covered by a high 
deductible plan, and A's spouse (``B'') is covered by a health 
plan that is not a high deductible plan. A makes contributions 
to an MSA for 1997. Withdrawals from the MSA to pay B's medical 
expenses incurred in 1997 would be includible in income (and 
subject to the additional tax on nonmedical withdrawals) 
because B is not covered by a high deductible plan.
      For this purpose, medical expenses are defined as under 
the itemized deduction for medical expenses, except that 
medical expenses do not include expenses for insurance other 
than long-term care insurance, premiums for health care 
continuation coverage, and premiums for health care coverage 
while an individual is receiving unemployment compensation 
under Federal or State law.
      Distributions that are not for medical expenses are 
includible in income. Such distributions are also subject to an 
additional 15-percent tax unless made after age 65, death, or 
disability.
            Estate tax treatment
      Upon death, any balance remaining in the decedent's MSA 
is includible in his or her gross estate.
      If the account holder's surviving spouse is the named 
beneficiary of the MSA, then, after the death of the account 
holder, the MSA becomes the MSA of the surviving spouse and the 
amount of the MSA balance may be deducted in computing the 
decedent's taxable estate, pursuant to the estate tax marital 
deduction provided in Code section 2056. The MSA qualifies for 
the marital deduction because the account holder has sole 
control over disposition of the assets in the MSA. The 
surviving spouse is not required to include any amount in 
income as a result of the death; the general rules applicable 
to MSAs apply to the surviving spouse's MSA (e.g., the 
surviving spouse is subject to income tax only on distributions 
from the MSA for nonmedical purposes). The surviving spouse can 
exclude from income amounts withdrawn from the MSA for expenses 
incurred by the decedent prior to death, to the extent they 
otherwise are qualified medical expenses.
      If, upon death, the MSA passes to a named beneficiary 
other than the decedent's surviving spouse, the MSA ceases to 
be an MSA as of the date of the decedent's death, and the 
beneficiary is required to include the fair market value of MSA 
assets as of the date of death in gross income for the taxable 
year that includes the date of death. The amount includable in 
income is reduced by the amount in the MSA used, within one 
year of the death, to pay qualified medical expenses incurred 
prior to the death. As is the case with other MSA 
distributions, whether the expenses are qualified medical 
expenses is determined as of the time the expenses were 
incurred. In computing taxable income, the beneficiary may 
claim a deduction for that portion of the Federal estate tax on 
the decendent's estate that was attributable to the amount of 
the MSA balance (calculated in accordance with the present-law 
rules relating to income in respect of a decedent set forth in 
sec. 691(c)).
      If there is no named beneficiary for the decedent's MSA, 
the MSA ceases to be an MSA as of the date of death, and the 
fair market value of the assets in the MSA as of such date are 
includible in the decedent's gross income for the year of the 
death. This rule applies in all cases in which there is no 
named beneficiary, even if the surviving spouse ultimately 
obtains the right to MSA assets (e.g., if the surviving spouse 
is the sole beneficiary of the decedent's estate). Because of 
the significant tax consequences if a married individual fails 
to name his or her spouse as the MSA beneficiary, even if the 
rights to MSA assets are otherwise acquired by the surviving 
spouse, it is anticipated that the marketing materials 
describing other tax aspects of MSAs will explain the 
consequences of failure to name the spouse as the beneficiary.
            Cap on taxpayers utilizing MSAs
      In general.--The number of taxpayers benefiting annually 
from an MSA contribution is limited to a threshold level 
(generally 750,000 taxpayers). If it is determined in a year 
that the threshold level has been exceeded (called a ``cut-
off'' year) then, in general, for succeeding years during the 
4-year pilot period 1997-2000, only those individuals who (1) 
made an MSA contribution or had an employer MSA contribution 
for the year or a preceding year (i.e. are active MSA 
participants) or (2) are employed by a participating employer, 
would be eligible for an MSA contribution. In determining 
whether the threshold for any year has been exceeded, MSAs of 
individuals who were not covered under a health insurance plan 
for the six month period ending on the date on which coverage 
under a high deductible plan commences would not be taken into 
account.\1\ However, if the threshold level is exceeded in a 
year, previously uninsured individuals would be subject to the 
same restriction on contributions in succeeding years as other 
individuals. That is, they would not be eligible for an MSA 
contribution for a year following a cut-off-year unless they 
are an active MSA participant (i.e. had an MSA contribution for 
the year or a preceding year) or are employed by a 
participating employer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Permitted coverage, as described above, does not constitute 
coverage under a health insurance plan for this purpose.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      In a year after a cut-off year, employees of a 
participating employer can establish new MSAs and make new 
contributions (even if the employee is a new employee or did 
not previously have an MSA). An employer is a participating 
employer if (1) the employer made any MSA contributions on 
behalf of employees in any preceding year or (2) at least 20 
percent of the employees covered under a high deductible plan 
made an MSA contribution of at least $100 in the preceding 
year.
      In the case of a cut-off year before 2000, an individual 
is not an eligible individual or an active MSA participant 
unless the individual was first covered under a high deductible 
plan on or before the cut-off date. The cut-off date is 
generally October 1 of the cut-off year. However, if the 
individual was enrolled in a plan pursuant to a regularly 
scheduled enrollment period, then the cut-off date is December 
31. Similarly, an employer is not considered a participating 
employer if it first offered coverage after October 1 of a cut-
off year unless the high deductible plan is offered pursuant to 
a regularly scheduled enrollment period. In addition, a self-
employed individual is not considered an eligible individual or 
an active MSA participant unless the individual was covered 
under a high deductible plan on or before November 1 of a cut-
off year.
      These rules are designed to prevent high deductible plans 
from being first offered just before the limitation on MSAs is 
effective in order to avoid application of the cap. They are 
not, however, intended to preclude individuals who first enroll 
in an employer-sponsored high deductible health plan or 
employees of employers that adopt a high deductible plan in a 
cut-off year due to normal health plan operation from having 
MSAs. For example, suppose a small employer offers a high 
deductible plan that provides that new employees may be covered 
under the plan beginning the first day of the month after the 
month in which they are hired. New employee A (whose previous 
coverage was not high deductible coverage) is hired on October 
15, and is enrolled in the high deductible plan November 1 of 
that year. If the year is a cut-off year, Employee A is an 
eligible individual and, if he has an MSA contribution for the 
year, an active participant for the year because he was 
enrolled pursuant to a regularly scheduled enrollment period. 
Similarly, suppose that employer A is a small employer and does 
not currently offer health care coverage. In 1997, A decides to 
offer health plan coverage to its employees, including a high 
deductible plan coupled with an MSA. A takes steps to provide 
such coverage on or before October 1 of the year (e.g., making 
arrangements with insurance companies or distributing plan 
material to employees). The first enrollment period for the 
health plans begins September 1, and coverage under the plan 
will begin November 1. If the year is a cut-off year, the 
employer is a participating employer because the plan was 
established pursuant to a regularly scheduled enrollment 
period.
      Under certain circumstances, MSA participation may be 
reopened after a cut-off year so that MSAs are again available 
to all individuals in the qualifying group of self-employed 
individuals and employees of small employers.
      For the 1997 tax year, taxpayers are permitted to 
establish MSAs provided that they are in the qualifying group 
of self-employed individuals or employees working for small 
employers.
            Rules for 1997
      On or before June 1, 1997, each trustee or custodian of 
an MSA (e.g., insurance company or financial institution) is 
required to report to the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') 
the total number of MSAs established as of April 30, 1997, for 
which it acts as trustee or custodian, including the number of 
MSAs established for previously uninsured individuals.\2\ If, 
based on this reporting, the number of MSAs established (but 
excluding those established for previously uninsured 
individuals) as of April 30, 1997, exceeds 375,000 (50 percent 
of 750,000), on or before September 1, 1997, the IRS would 
publish guidance providing that only active MSA participants or 
employees of participating employers would be eligible for an 
MSA contribution for the 1998 tax year and thereafter. If this 
threshold is exceeded, an individual who is first covered by an 
employer-sponsored high deductible health plan after September 
1, 1997, is not an eligible individual or an active MSA 
participant (and therefore cannot have an MSA for 1997 or a 
subsequent year) unless the high deductible coverage is elected 
pursuant to a regularly scheduled enrollment period. Similarly, 
an employer is not considered a participating employer if it 
first offered a high deductible plan after September 1, 1997, 
unless the plan was offered pursuant to a regularly scheduled 
enrollment period. Also, a self-employed individual would not 
be an eligible individual or an active MSA participant unless 
the individual was first covered under a high deductible plan 
on or before October 1, 1997.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ This report would include the name and social security number 
of taxpayers establishing an MSA. Failures to report are subject to a 
penalty of $25 for each MSA up to a maximum of $5,000. A trustee or 
custodian required to report could elect to do so on a company-wide or 
branch-by-branch basis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If the 375,000 cap is not exceeded, then another 
determination of MSA participation will be made, as follows. On 
or before August 1, 1997, each trustee or custodian of an MSA 
(e.g., insurance company or financial institution) is required 
to report to the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') the total 
number of MSAs established as of June 30, 1997, for which it 
acts as trustee or custodian, including the number of MSAs 
established for previously uninsured individuals. If, based on 
this reporting, the number of MSAs established (but excluding 
those established for previously uninsured individuals) exceeds 
the 1997 threshold level of 525,000 (70 percent of 750,000), on 
or before October 1, 1997, the IRS would publish guidance 
providing that only active MSA participants or employees of 
participating employers would be eligible for an MSA 
contribution for the 1998 tax year and thereafter. If the 1997 
threshold is exceeded, an individual who is first covered by an 
employer-sponsored high deductible health plan after October 1, 
1997, is not an eligible individual or an active MSA 
participant (and therefore cannot have an MSA for 1997 or a 
subsequent year) unless the high deductible coverage is elected 
pursuant to a regularly scheduled enrollment period. Similarly, 
an employer is not considered a participating employer if it 
first offered a high deductible plan after October 1, 1997, 
unless the plan was offered pursuant to a regularly scheduled 
enrollment period. Also, a self-employed individual would not 
be an eligible individual or an active MSA participant unless 
the individual was first covered under a high deductible plan 
on or before November 1, 1997.
      If the 1997 threshold level is not exceeded, all 
taxpayers in the qualifying eligible group (i.e., self-employed 
individuals and employees working for employers with 50 or 
fewer employees) would be permitted to have MSA contributions 
for the 1998 tax year.
            Rules for 1998 and succeeding years
      In general.--In 1998 and succeeding years, on or before 
August 1 of the year, each trustee or custodian of an MSA is 
required to report to the IRS the total number of MSAs 
established as of June 30 for the current year,\3\ including 
the number of such MSAs established for previously uninsured 
individuals. In addition, the IRS is directed to collect data 
with respect to the number of taxpayers showing an MSA 
contribution on their individual income tax returns for the 
prior year and the extent to which such taxpayers were 
previously uninsured.\4\ If, based on this information, the IRS 
determines as described below that the number of taxpayers 
anticipated to have MSA contributions (disregarding previously 
uninsured individuals) exceeds the applicable threshold level, 
the IRS is required to issue guidance to the public by no later 
than October 1. If this guidance is issued, then only taxpayers 
who are active MSA participants or who are employed by a 
participating employer would be entitled to MSA contributions 
in tax years following the year the guidance is issued.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ That is, the report would not include MSAs to which 
contributions are made for the prior year.
    \4\ Each income tax return on which an MSA contribution is shown is 
treated as one taxpayer for purposes of the cap. It is anticipated that 
the IRS would adjust the actual return information to take into account 
MSAs that may have been established by late filers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      For 1998 and succeeding years, the threshold is exceeded 
if either of the following limits are exceeded. The numerical 
limit is exceeded if: (1) the number of MSA returns filed on or 
before April 1 of the year, plus the estimate of the number of 
MSA returns for such year that will be filed after such date 
exceeds the threshold, or (2) 90 percent of the amount 
determined under (1), plus 15/6ths of the MSAs established for 
the year before July 1 exceeds $750,000.
      1998.--In 1998, the IRS would analyze the return data 
from the filing of 1997 tax year returns and would determine, 
based on this data, the number of taxpayers with MSA 
contributions for 1997 and who were not previously uninsured. 
If the IRS determines that (1) MSA returns filed on or before 
April 15, 1998, plus the estimated number of MSA returns for 
1997 filed after such date exceeds 600,000, or (2) that 90 
percent of the MSA returns in (1), plus 15/6ths of the number 
of MSAs established for 1998 between January 1 and July 1, 
1998, the IRS would publish guidance on or before October 1, 
1998, advising taxpayers that only taxpayers who had previously 
had MSA contributions (i.e., for either the 1997 or 1998 tax 
year) or who are employed by a participating employer would be 
eligible for MSA contributions in succeeding tax years. If the 
1998 threshold is exceeded, an individual who is first covered 
by an employer-sponsored high deductible health plan after 
October 1, 1998, is not an eligible individual or an active MSA 
participant (and therefore cannot have an MSA for 1998 or a 
subsequent year) unless the high deductible coverage is elected 
pursuant to a regularly scheduled enrollment period. Similarly, 
an employer is not considered a participating employer if it 
first offered a high deductible plan after October 1, 1998, 
unless the plan was offered pursuant to a regularly scheduled 
enrollment period. Also, a self-employed individual would not 
be an eligible individual or an active MSA participant unless 
the individual was first covered under a high deductible plan 
on or before November 1, 1998.
      In the event that the threshold level had not been 
exceeded, all taxpayers in the qualifying eligible group would 
be permitted to establish MSAs during the 1999 tax year.
      1999.--In 1999, the IRS would analyze the return data 
from the filing of 1998 tax year returns and would determine, 
based on this data, the number of taxpayers with MSA 
contributions for 1998 and who were not previously uninsured. 
If the IRS determines that (1) MSA returns filed on or before 
April 15, 1999, plus the estimated number of MSA returns for 
1998 filed after such date exceeds 600,000, or (2) that 90 
percent of the MSA returns in (1), plus 1\5/6\ths of the number 
of MSAs established for 1998 between January 1 and July 1, 
1999, the IRS would publish guidance on or before October 1, 
1999, advising taxpayers that only taxpayers who had previously 
had MSA contributions (i.e., for the 1997, 1998, or 1999 tax 
year) or who are employed by a participating employer would be 
eligible for MSA contributions in succeeding tax years. If the 
1999 threshold is exceeded, an individual who is first covered 
by an employer-sponsored high deductible health plan after 
October 1, 1999, is not an eligible individual or an active MSA 
participant (and therefore cannot have an MSA for 1999 or a 
subsequent year) unless the high deductible coverage is elected 
pursuant to a regularly scheduled enrollment period. Similarly, 
an employer is not considered a participating employer if it 
first offered a high deductible plan after October 1, 1999, 
unless the plan was offered pursuant to a regularly scheduled 
enrollment period. Also, a self-employed individual would not 
be an eligible individual or an active MSA participant unless 
the individual was first covered under a high deductible plan 
on or before November 1, 1999.
      In the event that the threshold level had not been 
exceeded, all taxpayers in the qualifying eligible group would 
be permitted to establish MSAs during the 2000 tax year.
      Reopening of MSA participation.--If 1997 is a cut-off 
year, then in 1998, the IRS would (as described above) analyze 
the return data from the filing of 1997 tax year returns and 
would determine, based on this data, the number of taxpayers 
with MSA contributions for 1997 and who were not previously 
uninsured. If the IRS determines that MSA returns filed on or 
before April 15, 1998, plus the estimated number of MSA returns 
for 1997 filed after such date (disregarding MSAs of previously 
uninsured individuals) exceeds 750,000, then the IRS will 
announce by October 1, 1998, that MSAs will be available to all 
eligible individuals in the qualifying eligible group of self-
employed individuals and employees of small employers covered 
under a high deductible health plan during the first 6 months 
of 1999. Similarly, if 1998 is a cut-off year, then in 1999, 
MSA returns filed on or before April 15, 1999, plus the 
estimated number of MSA returns for 1998 filed after such date 
(disregarding MSAs of previously uninsured individuals) exceeds 
750,000, then IRS will announce by October 1, 1998, that MSAs 
will be available to all eligible individuals in the qualifying 
eligible group of self-employed individuals and employees of 
small employers with high deductible plan coverage during the 
first 6 months of 2000.
            End of pilot project
      After December 31, 2000, no new contributions may be made 
to MSAs except by or on behalf of individuals who previously 
had MSA contributions and employees who are employed by a 
participating employer. An employer is a participating employer 
if (1) the employer made any MSA contributions for any year to 
an MSA on behalf of employees or (2) at least 20 percent of the 
employees covered under a high deductible plan made MSA 
contributions of at least $100 in the year 2000.
      Self-employed individuals who made contributions to an 
MSA during the period 1997-2000 also may continue to make 
contributions after 2000.
            Measuring the effects of MSAs
      During 1997-2000, the Department of the Treasury will 
evaluate MSA participation and the reduction in Federal 
revenues due to such participation and make such reports of 
such evaluations to the Congress as the Secretary determines 
appropriate.
      The General Accounting Office is directed to contract 
with an organization with expertise in health economics, health 
insurance markets and actuarial science to conduct a study 
regarding the effects of MSAs in the small group market on (1) 
selection (including adverse selection), (2) health costs, 
including the impact on premiums of individuals with 
comprehensive coverage, (3) use of preventive care, (4) 
consumer choice, (5) the scope of coverage of high deductible 
plans purchased in conjunction with an MSA and (6) other 
relevant issues, to be submitted to the Congress by January 1, 
1999.
      The conferees intend that the study be broad in scope, 
gather sufficient data to fully evaluate the relevant issues, 
and be adequately funded. The conferees expect the study to 
utilize appropriate techniques to measure the impact of MSAs on 
the broader health care market, including in-depth analysis of 
local markets with high penetration. The conferees expect the 
study to evaluate the impact of MSAs on individuals and 
families experiencing high health care costs, especially low- 
and middle-income families.
            Definiton of MSA
      In general, an MSA is a trust or custodial account 
created exclusively for the benefit of the account holder and 
subject to rules similar to those applicable to individual 
retirement arrangements.
            Effective date
      The provisions are effective for taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1996.

b. increase in deduction for health insurance expenses of Self-employed 
                              individuals

      (Sec. 311 of the House bill and sec. 401 of the Senate 
amendment.)
Present law
      Under present law, self-employed individuals are entitled 
to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance 
for the self-employed individual and the individual's spouse 
and dependents. The deduction is not available for any month in 
which the taxpayer is eligible to participate in a subsidized 
health plan maintained by the employer of the taxpayer or the 
taxpayer's spouse. The 30-percent deduction is available in the 
case of self insurance as well as commercial insurance. The 
self-insured plan must in fact be insurance (e.g., there must 
be appropriate risk shifting) and not merely a reimbursement 
arrangement.
House bill
      Under the House bill, the deduction for health insurance 
for self-employed individuals is phased up to 50 percent as 
follows: for taxable years beginning in 1998, the amount of the 
deduction would be 35 percent of health insurance expenses; for 
taxable years beginning in 1999, 2000, and 2001, 40 percent; 
for taxable years beginning in 2002, 45 percent; and for 
taxable years beginning in 2003 and thereafter, 50 percent.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1997.
Senate amendment
      Beginning in 1997, the Senate amendment phases up the 
deduction in 5 percent increments until it is 80 percent in 
2006 and thereafter.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1996.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement increases the deduction for 
health insurance of self-employed individuals as follows: the 
deduction would be 40 percent in 1997; 45 percent in 1998 
through 2002; 50 percent in 2003; 60 percent in 2004; 70 
percent in 2005; and 80 percent in 2006 and thereafter.
      The conference agreement also provides that payments for 
personal injury or sickness through an arrangements having the 
effect of accident or health insurance (and that are not merely 
reimbursement arrangements) are excludable from income. In 
order for the exclusion to apply, the arrangement must be 
insurance (e.g., there must be adequate risk shifting). This 
provision equalizes the treatment of payments under commercial 
insurance and arrangements other than commercial insurance that 
have the effect of insurance. Under this provision, a self-
employed individual who receives payments from such an 
arrangement could exclude the payments from income.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1996. No inference is 
intended with respect to the excludability of payments under 
arrangements having the effect of accident or health insurance 
under present law.

         c. treatment of long-term care insurance and services

      (Secs. 321-323 and 325-328 of the House bill and secs. 
411-415 and 421-424 of the Senate amendment.)
Present law
            In general
      Present law generally does not provide explicit rules 
relating to the tax treatment of long-term care insurance 
contracts or long-term care services. Thus, the treatment of 
long-term care contracts and services is unclear. Present law 
does provide rules relating to medical expenses and accident or 
health insurance.
            Itemized deduction for medical expenses
      In determining taxable income for Federal income tax 
purposes, a taxpayer is allowed an itemized deduction for 
unreimbursed expenses that are paid by the taxpayer during the 
taxable year for medical care of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's 
spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer, to the extent that such 
expenses exceed 7.5 percent of the adjusted gross income of the 
taxpayer for such year (sec. 213). For this purpose, expenses 
paid for medical care generally are defined as amounts paid: 
(1) for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or 
prevention of disease (including prescription medicines or 
drugs and insulin), or for the purpose of affecting any 
structure or function of the body (other than cosmetic surgery 
not related to disease, deformity, or accident); (2) for 
transportation primarily for, and essential to, medical care 
referred to in (1); or (3) for insurance (including Part B 
Medicare premiums) covering medical care referred to in (1) and 
(2).
            Exclusion for amounts received under accident or health 
                    insurance
      Amounts received by a taxpayer under accident or health 
insurance for personal injuries or sickness generally are 
excluded from gross income to the extent that the amounts 
received are not attributable to medical expenses that were 
allowed as a deduction for a prior taxable year (sec. 104).
            Treatment of accident or health plans maintained by 
                    employers
      Contributions of an employer to an accident or health 
plan that provides compensation (through insurance or 
otherwise) to an employee for personal injuries or sickness of 
the employee, the employee's spouse, or a dependent of the 
employee, are excluded from the gross income of the employee 
(sec. 106). In addition, amounts received by an employee under 
such a plan generally are excluded from gross income to the 
extent that the amounts received are paid, directly or 
indirectly, to reimburse the employee for expenses for the 
medical care of the employee, the employee's spouse, or a 
dependent of the employee (sec. 105). for this purpose, 
expenses incurred for medical care are defined in the same 
manner as under the rules regarding the deduction for medical 
expenses.
      A cafeteria plan is an employer-sponsored arrangement 
under which employees can elect among cash and certain 
employer-provided qualified benefits. No amount is included in 
the gross income of a participant in a cafeteria plan merely 
because the participant has the opportunity to make such an 
election (sec. 125). Employer-provided accident or health 
coverage is one of the benefits that may be offered under a 
cafeteria plan.
      A flexible spending arrangement (``FSA'') is an 
arrangement under which an employee is reimbursed for medical 
expenses or other nontaxable employer-provided benefits, such 
as dependent care, and under which the maximum amount of 
reimbursement that is reasonably available to a participant for 
a period of coverage is not substantially in excess of the 
total premium (including both employee-paid and employer-paid 
portions of the premium) for such participant's coverage. Under 
proposed Treasury regulations, a maximum amount of 
reimbursement is not substantially in excess of the total 
premium if such maximum amount is less than 500 percent of the 
premium. An FSA may be part of a cafeteria plan or provided by 
an employer outside a cafeteria plan. FSAs are commonly used to 
reimburse employees for medical expenses not covered by 
insurance. If certain requirements are satisfied,\5\ amounts 
reimbursed for nontaxable benefits from an FSA are excludable 
from income.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ These requirements include a requirement that a health FSA can 
only provide reimbursement for medical expenses (as defined in sec. 
213) and cannot provide reimbursement for premium payments for other 
health coverage and that the maximum amount of reimbursement under a 
health FSA must be available at all times during the period of 
coverage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Health care continuation rules
      The health care continuation rules require that an 
employer must provide qualified beneficiaries the opportunity 
to continue to participate for a specified period in the 
employer's health plan after the occurrence of certain events 
(such as termination of employment) that would have terminated 
such participation (sec. 4980B). Individuals electing 
continuation coverage can be required to pay for such coverage.
House bill
            Tax treatment and definition of long-term care insurance 
                    contracts and qualified long-term care services
      Exclusion of long-term care proceeds.--A long-term care 
insurance contract generally is treated as an accident and 
health insurance contract. Amounts (other than policyholder 
dividends or premium refunds) received under a long-term care 
insurance contract generally are excludable as amounts received 
for personal injuries and sickness, subject to a cap of $175 
per day, or $63,875 annually, on per diem contracts only. If 
the aggregate amount of periodic payments under all qualified 
long-term care contracts exceeds the dollar cap for the period, 
then the amount of such excess payments is excludable only to 
the extent of the individual's costs (that are not otherwise 
compensated for by insurance or otherwise) for long-term care 
services during the period. The dollar cap is indexed by the 
medical care cost component of the consumer price index.
      Exclusion for employer-provided long-term care 
coverage.--A plan of an employer providing coverage under a 
long-term care insurance contract generally is treated as an 
accident and health plan. Employer-provided coverage under a 
long-term care insurance contract is not, however, excludable 
by an employee if provided through a cafeteria plan; similarly, 
expenses for long-term care services cannot be reimbursed under 
an FSA.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ The bill does not otherwise modify the requirements relating to 
FSAs. An FSA is defined as a benefit program providing employees with 
coverage under which specified incurred expenses may be reimbursed 
(subject to maximums and other reasonable conditions), and the maximum 
amount of reimbursement that is reasonably available to a participant 
is less than 500 percent of the value of the coverage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Definition of long-term care insurance contract.--A long-
term care insurance contract is defined as any insurance 
contract that provides only coverage of qualified long-term 
care services and that meets other requirements. The other 
requirements are that (1) the contract is guaranteed renewable, 
(2) the contract does not provide for a cash surrender value or 
other money that can be paid, assigned, pledged or borrowed, 
(3) refunds (other than refunds on the death of the insured or 
complete surrender or cancellation of the contract) and 
dividends under the contract may be used only to reduce future 
premiums or increase future benefits, and (4) the contract 
generally does not pay or reimburse expenses reimbursable under 
Medicare (except where Medicare is a secondary payor, or the 
contract makes per diem or other periodic payments without 
regard to expenses).
      A contract does not fail to be treated as a long-term 
care insurance contract solely because it provides for payments 
on a per diem or other periodic basis without regard to 
expenses incurred during the period.
      Medicare duplication rules.--The bill provides that no 
provision of law shall be construed or applied so as to 
prohibit the offering of a long-term care insurance contract on 
the basis that the contract coordinates its benefits with those 
provided under Medicare. Thus, long-term care insurance 
contracts are not subject to the rules requiring duplication of 
Medicare benefits.
      Definition of qualified long-term care services.--
Qualified long-term care services means necessary diagnostic, 
preventive, therapeutic, curing, treating, mitigating and 
rehabilitative services, and maintenance or personal care 
services that are required by a chronically ill individual and 
that are provided pursuant to a plan of care prescribed by a 
licensed health care practitioner.
      Chronically ill individual.--A chronically ill individual 
is one who has been certified within the previous 12 months by 
a licensed health care practitioner as (1) being unable to 
perform (without substantial assistance) at least 2 activities 
of daily living for at least 90 days \7\ due to a loss of 
functional capacity, (2) having a similar level of disability 
as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation 
with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or (3) 
requiring substantial supervision to protect such individual 
from threats to health and safety due to severe cognitive 
impairment. Activities of daily living are eating, toileting, 
transferring, bathing, dressing and continence.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ The 90-day period is not a waiting period. Thus, for example, 
an individual can be certified was chronically ill if the licensed 
health care practitioner certifies that the individual will be unable 
to perform at least 2 activities of daily living for at least 90 days.
    \8\ Nothing in the bill requires the contract to take into account 
all of the activities of daily living. For example, a contract could 
require that an individual be unable to perform (without substantial 
assistance) 2 out of any 5 such activities, or for another example, 3 
out of the 6 activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      It is intended that an individual who is physically able 
but has a cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's disease or 
another form of irreversible loss of mental capacity be treated 
similarly to an individual who is unable to perform (without 
substantial assistance) at least 2 activities of daily living. 
Because of the concern that eligibility for the medical expense 
deduction not be diagnosis-driven, the provision requires the 
cognitive impairment to be severe. It is intended that severe 
cognitive impairment mean a deterioration or loss in 
intellectual capacity that is measured by clinical evidence and 
standardized tests which reliably measure impairment in: (1) 
short- or long-term memory; (2) orientation to people, places 
or time; and (3) deductive or abstract reasoning. In addition, 
it is intended that such deterioration or loss place the 
individual in jeopardy of harming self or others and therefore 
require substantial supervision by another individual.
      A licensed health care practitioner is a physician (as 
defined in sec. 1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act) and any 
registered professional nurse, licensed social worker or other 
individual who meets such requirements as may be prescribed by 
the Secretary of the Treasury.
      Expenses for long-term care services treated as medical 
expenses.--Unreimbursed expenses for qualified long-term care 
services provided to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse or 
dependents are treated as medical expenses for purposes of the 
itemized deduction for medical expenses (subject to the 
present-law floor of 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income). For 
this purpose, amounts received under a long-term care insurance 
contract (regardless of whether the contract reimburses 
expenses or pays benefits on a per diem or other periodic 
basis) are treated as reimbursement for expenses actually 
incurred for medical care.
      For purposes of the deduction for medical expenses, 
qualified long-term care services do not include services 
provided to an individual by a relative or spouse (directly, or 
through a partnership, corporation, or other entity), unless 
the relative is a licensed professional with respect to such 
services, or by a related corporation (within the meaning of 
Code section 267(b) or 707(b)).\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ The rule limiting such services provided by a relative or a 
related corporation does not apply for purposes of the exclusion for 
amounts received under a long-term care insurance contract, whether the 
contract is employer-provided or purchased by an individual. The 
limitation in unnecessary in such cases because it is anticipated that 
the insurer will monitor reimbursements to limit opportunities for 
fraud in connection with the performance of services by the taxpayer's 
relative or a related corporation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Long-term care insurance premiums treated as medical 
expenses.--Long-term care insurance premiums that do not exceed 
specified dollar limits are treated as medical expenses for 
purposes of the itemized deduction for medical expenses.\10\ 
The limits are as follows:

    \10\ Similarly, within certain limits, in the case of a rider to a 
life insurance contract, charges against the life insurance contract's 
cash surrender value that are includible in income are treated as 
medical expenses (provided the rider constitutes a long-term care 
insurance contract).

In the case of an individual with an attained age before the close of 
    the taxable yearThe limitation on premiums paid for such taxable 
                    years is:
        Not more than 40..........................................  $200
        More than 40 but not more than 50.........................   375
        More than 50 but not more than 60.........................   750
        More than 60 but not more than 70......................... 2,000
        More than 70.............................................. 2,500

      For taxable years beginning after 1997, these dollar 
limits are indexed for increases in the medical care component 
of the consumer price index. The Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
is directed to develop a more appropriate index to be applied 
in lieu of the foregoing. Such an alternative might 
appropriately be based on increases in skilled nursing facility 
and home health care costs. It is intended that the Treasury 
Secretary annually publish the indexed amount of the limits as 
early in the year as they can be calculated.
      Deduction for long-term care insurance of self-employed 
individuals.--The present-law 30 percent deduction for health 
insurance expenses of self-employed individuals is phased up to 
50 percent under the bill. Because the bill treats payments of 
eligible long-term care insurance premiums in the same manner 
as medical insurance premiums, the self-employed health 
insurance deduction applies to eligible long-term care 
insurance premiums under the bill.
      Long-term care riders on life insurance contracts.--In 
the case of long-term care insurance coverage provided by a 
rider on or as part of a life insurance contract, the 
requirements applicable to long-term care insurance contracts 
apply as if the portion of the contract providing such coverage 
were a separate contract. The term ``portion'' means only the 
terms and benefits that are in addition to the terms and 
benefits under the life insurance contract without regard to 
long-term care coverage. As a result, if the applicable 
requirements are met by the long-term care portion of the 
contract, amounts received under the contract as provided by 
the rider are treated in the same manner as long-term care 
insurance benefits, whether or not the payment of such amounts 
causes a reduction in the contract's death benefit or cash 
surrender value. The guideline premium limitation applicable 
under section 7702(c)(2) is increased by the sum of charges 
(but not premium payments) against the life insurance 
contract's cash surrender value, the imposition of which 
reduces premiums paid for the contract (within the meaning of 
sec. 7702(f)(1)). In addition, it is anticipated that Treasury 
regulations will provide for appropriate reduction in premiums 
paid (within the meaning of sec. 7702(f)(1)) to reflect the 
payment of benefits under the rider that reduce the cash 
surrender value of the life insurance contract. A similar rule 
should apply in the case of a contract governed by section 
101(f) and in the case of the payments under a rider that are 
excludable under section 101(g) of the Code (as added by this 
bill).
      Health care continuation rules.--The health care 
continuation rules do not apply to coverage under a long-term 
care insurance contract.
            Inclusion of excess long-term care benefits
      In general, the bill provides that the maximum annual 
amount of long-term care benefits under a per diem type 
contract that is excludable from income with respect to an 
insured who is chronically ill (not including amounts received 
by reason of the individual being terminally ill) \11\ cannot 
exceed the equivalent of $175 per day for each day the 
individual is chronically ill. Thus, for per diem type 
contracts, the maximum annual exclusion for long-term care 
benefits with respect to any chronically ill individual (not 
including amounts received by reason of the individual being 
terminally ill) is $63,875 (for 1997). If payments under such 
contracts exceed the dollar limit, then the excess is 
excludable only to the extent the individual has incurred 
actual costs for long-term care services. If the insured is not 
the same as the holder of the contract, the insured may assign 
some or all of this limit to the contract holder at the time 
and manner prescribed by the Secretary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ Terminally ill is defined as under the provision of the bill 
relating to accelerated death benefits. In general, under that 
provision, an individual is considered to be terminally ill if he or 
she is certified as having an illness or physical condition that 
reasonably can be expected to result in death within 24 months of the 
date of the certification.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      This $175 per day limit is indexed for inflation after 
1997 for increases in the medical care component of the 
consumer price index. The Treasury Secretary, in consultation 
with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, is directed to 
develop a more appropriate index, to be applied in lieu of the 
foregoing. Such an alternative might appropriately be based on 
increases in skilled nursing facility and home health care 
costs. It is intended that the Treasury Secretary annually 
publish the indexed amount of the limit as early in the year as 
it can be calculated.
      A payor of long-term care benefits (defined for this 
purpose to include any amount paid under a product advertised, 
marketed or offered as long-term care insurance) is required to 
report to the IRS the aggregate amount of such benefits paid to 
any individual during any calendar year, and the name, address 
and taxypayer identification number of such individual. A copy 
of the report must be provided to the payee by January 31 
following the year of payment, showing the name of the payor 
and the aggregate amount of benefits paid to the individual 
during the calendar year. Failure to file the report or provide 
the copy to the payee is subject to the generally applicable 
penalties for failure to file similar information reports.
            Consumer protection provisions
      Under the bill, long-term care insurance contracts, and 
issuers of contracts, are required to satisfy certain 
provisions of the long-term care insurance model Act and model 
regulations promulgated by the National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners (as adopted as of January 1993). The 
policy requirements relate to disclosure, nonforfeitability, 
guaranteed renewal or noncancellability, prohibitions on 
limitations and exclusions, extension of benefits, continuation 
or conversion of coverage, discontinuance and replacement of 
policies, unintentional lapse, post-claims underwriting, 
minimum standards, inflation protection, preexisting 
conditions, and prior hospitalization. The bill also provides 
disclosure and nonforfeiture requirements. The nonforfeiture 
provision gives consumers the option of selecting reduced paid-
up insurance, extended term insurance, or a shortened benefit 
period in the event a policyholder who elects a nonforfeiture 
provision is unable to continue to pay premiums. The 
requirements for issuers of long-term care insurance contracts 
relate to application forms, reporting requirements, marketing, 
appropriateness of purchase, format, delivering a shopper's 
guide, right to return, outline of coverage, group plans, 
policy summary, monthly reports on accelerated death benefits, 
and incontestability period. A tax is imposed equal to $100 per 
policy per day for failure to satisfy these requirements.
      Nothing in the bill prevents a State from establishing, 
implementing or continuing standards related to the protection 
of policyholders of long-term care insurance policies, if such 
standards are not inconsistent with standards established under 
the bill.
            Effective date
      The provisions defining long-term care insurance 
contracts and qualified long-term care services apply to 
contracts issued after December 31, 1996. Any contract issued 
before January 1, 1997, that met the long-term care insurance 
requirements in the State in which the policy was sitused at 
the time it was issued shall be treated as a long-term care 
insurance contract, and services provided under or reimbursed 
by the contract treated as qualified long-term care services.
      A contract providing for long-term care insurance may be 
exchanged for a long-term care insurance contract (or the 
former cancelled and the proceeds reinvested in the latter 
within 60 days) tax free between the date of enactment and 
January 1, 1998. Taxable gain would be recognized to the extent 
money or other property is received in the exchange.
      The issuance or conformance of a rider to a life 
insurance contract providing long-term care insurance coverage 
is not treated as a modification or a material change for 
purposes of applying sections 101(f), 7702, and 7702A of the 
Code.
      The provision relating to treatment of eligible long-term 
care premiums as a medical expense is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1996. The provision treating 
amounts paid for long-term care services as a medical expense 
(for purposes of the medical expense deduction) is effective 
for services furnished in taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1997.
      The provisions relating to the maximum exclusion for 
certain long-term care benefits and reporting are effective for 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996. Thus, the 
initial year in which reports will be filed with the IRS and 
copies provided to the payee will be 1998, with respect to 
long-term care benefits paid in 1997.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill, 
except as follows.
            Life insurance company reserves
      In determining reserves for insurance company tax 
purposes, the Senate amendment provides that the Federal income 
tax reserve method applicable for a long-term care insurance 
contract issued after December 31, 1996, is the method 
prescribed by the National Association of Insurance 
Commissioners (``NAIC'') (or, if no reserve method has been so 
prescribed, a method consistent with the tax reserve method for 
life insurance, annuity or noncancellable accident and health 
insurance contracts, whichever is most appropriate). The method 
currently prescribed by the NAIC for long-term care insurance 
contracts is the one-year full preliminary term method. As 
under present law, however, in no event may the tax reserve for 
a contract as of any time exceed the amount which would be 
taken into account with respect to the contract as of such time 
in determining statutory reserves.
            Exchanges of life insurance and other contracts for long-
                    term care insurance contracts
      The exchange of a life insurance contract or an endowment 
or annuity contract for a qualified long-term care insurance 
contract is not taxable under the Senate amendment.
            Distributions from IRAs and retirement plans for long-term 
                    care insurance
      The Senate amendment permits certain plans to make 
distributions to pay premiums for long-term care insurance for 
the individual or the individual's spouse and provides that the 
10-percent tax on early withdrawals does not apply to such 
distributions. The provision applies to distributions from 
individual retirement arrangements (``IRAs'') and distributions 
attributable to elective deferrals to qualified cash or 
deferred arrangements (sec. 401(k) plans), tax-sheltered 
annuities (sec. 403(b) plans), nonqualified deferred 
compensation plans of governmental or tax-exempt employers 
(sec. 457 plans), and section 501(c)(18) plans used to pay 
premiums for long-term care insurance for the individual or the 
individual's spouse. Such distributions are includable in 
income (as under present law).
            Effective dates
      The effective dates are the same as the House bill, 
except as follows.
      The provision treating long-term care services as a 
medical expense is effective for taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1996.
      The change in treatment of reserves for long-term care 
insurance contracts is effective for contracts issued after 
December 31, 1996.
      The provision relating to tax-free exchanges of life 
insurance, endowment and annuity contracts for long-term care 
insurance contracts is effective for taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1997.
      The provision relating to certain distributions from IRAs 
and elective deferrals used to pay long-term care insurance 
premiums is effective for payments and distributions after 
December 31, 1996.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement generally follows the House 
bill, except as follows.
            Tax treatment and definition of long-term care insurance 
                    contracts and qualified long-term care services
      Chronically ill individual.--The conference agreement 
provides that, for purposes of determining whether an 
individual is chronically ill, the number of activities of 
daily living that are taken into account under the contract may 
not be less than five. For example, a contract could require 
that an individual be unable to perform (without substantial 
assistance) two out of any five of the activities listed in the 
bill. By contrast, a contract does not meet this requirement if 
it required that an individual be unable to perform two out of 
any four of the activities listed in the bill.
      In addition, the conference agreement modifies the second 
test for whether an individual is chronically ill (i.e., that 
the individual has a level of disability similar to an 
individual who is unable to perform (without substantial 
assistance) at least two activities of daily living). Under the 
conference agreement, this test is met if the individual has 
been certified within the previous 12 months by a licensed 
health care practitioner as having a similar level of 
disability, as determined under regulations prescribed by the 
Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services.
      Health care continuation rules.--The health care 
continuation rules do not apply to coverage under a plan, 
substantially all of the coverage under which is for qualified 
long-term care services.
      State-maintained plans.--The conference agreement 
modifies the definition of a qualified long-term care insurance 
contract. Under the conference agreement, an arrangement is 
treated as a qualified long-term care insurance contract if an 
individual receives coverage for qualified long-term care 
services under a State long-term care plan, and the terms of 
the arrangement would satisfy the requirements for a long-term 
care insurance contract under the provision, were the 
arrangement an insurance contract. For this purpose, a State 
long-term care plan is any plan established and maintained by a 
State (or instrumentality of such State) under which only 
employees (and former employees, including retirees) of a State 
or of a political subdivision or instrumentality of the State, 
and their relatives, and their spouses and spouses' relatives, 
may receive coverage only for qualified long-term care 
services. Relative is defined as under section 152(a)(1)-(8). 
No inference is intended with respect to the tax consequences 
of such arrangements under present law.
            Inclusions of excess long-term care benefits
      The conference agreement modifies the calculation of the 
dollar cap applicable to aggregate payments under per diem type 
long-term care insurance contracts and amounts received with 
respect to a chronically ill individual pursuant to a life 
insurance contract.\12\ The amount of the dollar cap with 
respect to any one chronically ill individual (who is not 
terminally ill) is $175 per day ($63,875 annually, as indexed), 
reduced by the amount of reimbursements and payments received 
by anyone for the cost of qualified long-term care services for 
the chronically ill individual. If more than one payee receives 
payments with respect to any one chronically ill individual, 
then everyone receiving periodic payments with respect to the 
same insured is treated as one person for purposes of the 
dollar cap. The amount of the dollar cap is utilized first by 
the chronically ill person, and any remaining amount is 
allocated in accordance with Treasury regulations. If payments 
under such contracts exceed the dollar cap, then the excess is 
excludable only to the extent of actual costs (in excess of the 
dollar cap) incurred for long-term care services. Amounts in 
excess of the dollar cap, with respect to which no actual costs 
were incurred for long-term care services, are fully includable 
in income without regard to rules relating to return of basis 
under Code section 72.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ See item D, below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The managers of the bill wish to clarify that, although 
the legislation imposes a daily (or equivalent) dollar cap on 
the amount of excludable benefits under certain types of long-
term care insurance in certain circumstances, this limitation 
is not intended to suggest a preference or otherwise convey or 
facilitate a competitive advantage to one type of long-term 
care insurance compared to another type of long-term care 
insurance.
      The Chairmen of the House Committee on Ways and Means and 
the Senate Finance Committee shall jointly request that the 
NAIC, in consultation with representatives of the insurance 
industry and consumer organizations, develop and conduct a 
study to determine the marketing and other effects, if any, of 
the dollar limit on excludable long-term care benefits under 
certain types of long-term care insurance contracts under the 
bill. Such Chairmen are to request that the NAIC, if it agrees 
to such request, shall submit the results of its study to the 
such Committees by no later than two years after agreeing to 
the request.
      The conference agreement modifies the reporting 
requirement for payors of amounts excludable under the 
provision. Thus, in addition to the reporting requirements of 
the House bill, a payor is required to report the name, 
address, and taxpayer identification number of the chronically 
ill individual on account of whose condition such amounts are 
paid, and whether the contract under which the amount is paid 
is a per diem-type contract.
      A grandfather rule is provided under the conference 
agreement in the case of a per diem type contract issued to a 
policyholder on or before July 31, 1996. Under the grandfather 
rule, the amount of the dollar cap with respect to such a per 
diem contract is calculated without any reduction for 
reimbursements for qualified long-term care services under any 
other contract issued with respect to the same insured on or 
before July 31, 1996. The other provisions of the dollar cap 
are not affected by the grandfather rule. The grandfather rule 
ceases to apply as of the time that any of the contracts issued 
on or before July 31, 1996, with respect to the insured are 
exchanged, or benefits are increased.
            Life insurance company reserves
      The conference agreement includes the Senate amendment 
provision with respect to life insurance reserves. Thus, under 
the conference agreement, in determining reserves for insurance 
company tax purposes, the Senate amendment provides that the 
Federal income tax reserve method applicable for a long-term 
care insurance contract is the method prescribed by the NAIC 
(or, if no reserve method has been so prescribed, a method 
consistent with the tax reserve method for life insurance, 
annuity or noncancellable accident and health insurance 
contracts, whichever is most appropriate). As under present 
law, in no event may the tax reserve for a contract as of any 
time exceed the amount which would be taken into account with 
respect to the contract as of such time in determining 
statutory reserves.
            Consumer protection provisions
      The conference agreement clarifies and modifies the 
category of contracts to which the consumer protection 
provisions apply. The conference agreement clarifies that the 
consumer protection provisions that apply with respect to the 
terms of the contract apply only for purposes of determining 
whether a contract is a qualified long-term care insurance 
contract (within the meaning of the bill).
      The conference agreement provides that, for purposes of 
both the requirements as to contract terms and the requirements 
relating to issuers of contracts, the determination of whether 
any requirement of a model regulation or model Act has been met 
is made by the Secretary of the Treasury. It is not intended 
that the Secretary create a Federal standard, but rather, look 
to applicable or appropriate State standards or to those 
provided specifically in the model regulation or model Act.
      The conference agreement modifies the $100-per-day tax on 
failure to satisfy the requirements for issuers of contracts, 
to provide that the amount of the tax imposed is $100 per 
insured per day. The conference agreement provides that the 
consumer protection requirements for issuers of contracts apply 
with respect to contracts that are qualified long-term care 
insurance contracts (within the meaning of the bill).
      The conference agreement modifies the rule relating to 
State establishment of standards relating to contract terms or 
issuers of contracts. The conference agreement provides that an 
otherwise qualified long-term care insurance contract will not 
fail to be a qualified long-term care insurance contract, and 
will not be treated as failing to meet the analogous 
requirement under the conference agreement, solely because it 
satisfies a consumer protection standard imposed under 
applicable State law that is more stringent than the analogous 
standard provided in the bill. The conference agreement does 
not preclude States from enacting more stringent consumer 
protection provisions than the analogous standards under the 
bill.
            Effective date
      The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment 
with respect to the effective date of the provision treating 
long-term care services as a medical expense. Thus, under the 
conference agreement, this provision is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1996.
      The conference agreement provides that the provision 
relating to life insurance company reserves is effective for 
contracts issued after December 31, 1997.

    d. treatment of accelerated death benefits under life insurance 
                               contracts

      (Secs. 331-332 of the House bill and secs. 431-432 of the 
Senate amendment).
Present law
            Treatment of amounts received under a life insurance 
                    contract
      If a contract meets the definition of a life insurance 
contract, gross income does not include insurance proceeds that 
are paid pursuant to the contract by reason of the death of the 
insured (sec. 101(a)). In addition, the undistributed 
investment income (``inside buildup'') earned on premiums 
credited under the contract is not subject to current taxation 
to the owner of the contract. The exclusion under section 101 
applies regardless of whether the death benefits are paid as a 
lump sum or otherwise.
      Amounts received under a life insurance contract (other 
than a modified endowment contract) prior to the death of the 
insured are includible in the gross income of the recipient to 
the extent that the amount received constitutes cash value in 
excess of the taxpayer's investment in the contract (generally, 
the investment in the contract is the aggregate amount of 
premiums paid less amounts previously received that were 
excluded from gross income).
      If a contract fails to be treated as a life insurance 
contract under section 7702(a), inside buildup on the contract 
is generally subject to tax (sec. 7702(g)).
            Requirements for a life insurance contract
      To qualify as a life insurance contract for Federal 
income tax purposes, a contract must be a life insurance 
contract under the applicable State or foreign law and must 
satisfy either of two alternative tests: (1) cash value 
accumulation test or (2) a test consisting of a guideline 
premium requirement and a cash value corridor requirement (sec. 
7702(a)). A contract satisfies the cash value accumulation test 
if the cash surrender value of the contract may not at any time 
exceed the net single premium that would have to be paid at 
such time to fund future benefits under the contract. A 
contract satisfies the guideline premium and cash value 
corridor tests if the premiums paid under the contract do not 
at any time exceed the greater of the guideline single premium 
or the sum of the guideline level premiums, and if the death 
benefit under the contract is not less than a varying statutory 
percentage of the cash surrender value of the contract.
            Proposed regulations on accelerated death benefits
      The Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations 
\13\ under which certain ``qualified accelerated death 
benefits'' paid by reason of the terminal illness of an insured 
would be treated as paid by reason of the death of the insured 
and therefore qualify for exclusion under section 101. In 
addition, the proposed regulations would permit an insurance 
contract that includes a qualified accelerated death benefit 
rider to qualify as a life insurance contract under section 
7702. Thus, the proposed regulations provide that including 
this benefit would not cause an insurance contract to fail to 
meet the definition of a life insurance contract.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ Prop. Treas. Reg. Secs. 1.101-8, 1.7702-0, 1.7702-2, and 
1.7702A-1 (December 15, 1992).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Under the proposed regulations, a benefit would qualify 
as a qualified accelerated death benefit only if it meets three 
requirements. First, the accelerated death benefit can be 
payable only if the insured becomes terminally ill. Second, the 
amount of the benefit must equal or exceed the present value of 
the reduction in the death benefit otherwise payable.\14\ 
Third, the cash surrender value and the death benefit payable 
under the policy must be reduced proportionately as a result of 
the accelerated death benefit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ For purposes of determining the present value under the 
proposed regulations, the maximum permissible discount rate would be 
the greater of (1) the applicable Federal rate that applies under the 
discounting rules for property and casualty insurance loss reserves, 
and (2) the interest rate applicable to policy loans under the 
contract. Also, the present value would be determined assuming that the 
death benefit would have been paid twelve months after payment of the 
accelerated death benefit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      For purposes of the proposed regulations, an insured 
would be treated as terminally ill if he or she has an illness 
that, despite appropriate medical care, the insurer reasonably 
expects to result in death within twelve months from the 
payment of the accelerated death benefit. The proposed 
regulations would not apply to viatical settlements.
House bill
      The House bill provides an exclusion from gross income as 
an amount paid by reason of the death of an insured for (1) 
amounts received under a life insurance contract and (2) amount 
received for the sale or assignment of a life insurance 
contract to a qualified viatical settlement provider, provided 
that the insured under the life insurance contract is either 
terminally ill or chronically ill. The exclusion for amounts 
received under a life insurance contract on the life of an 
insured who is chronically ill applies if the amount is 
received under a rider or other provision of the contract that 
is treated as a long-term care insurance contract under section 
7702B (as added by the bill), and the amount is excludable as a 
payment for long-term care services under section 7702B 
(including under the dollar cap on per diem type payments ($175 
per day, or $63,875 annually, in 1997).
      The provision does not apply in the case of an amount 
paid to any taxpayer other than the insured, if such taxpayer 
has an insurable interest by reason of the insured being a 
director, officer or employee of the taxpayer, or by reason of 
the insured being financial interested in any trade or business 
carried on by the taxpayer.
      A terminally ill individual is defined as one who has 
been certified by a physician as having an illness or physical 
condition that reasonably can be expected to result in death 
within 24 months of the date of certification. A physician is 
defined for this purpose in the same manner as under the long-
term care insurance rules of the bill.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \15\ A physician is defined for these purposes as in section 
1861(r)(1) of the Social Security Act, which provides that a physician 
means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy legally authorized to practice 
medicine and surgery by the State in which he performs such function or 
action (including a physician within the meaning of section 1101(a)(7) 
of that Act). Section 1101(a)(7) of that Act provides that the term 
physician includes osteopathic practitioners within the scope of their 
practice as defined by State law.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      A chronically ill individual is defined under the long-
term care provisions of the bill.\16\ In the case of amounts 
received with respect to a chronically ill individual (but not 
amounts received by reason of the individual being terminally 
ill), the $175 per day ($63,875 annual) limitation on 
excludable benefits that applies for per diem type long-term 
care insurance contracts also limits amounts that are 
excludable with respect to such contracts under this provision.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ Thus, a chronically ill individual is one who has been 
certified within the previous 12 months by a licensed health care 
practitioner as (1) being unable to perform (without substantial 
assistance) at least 2 activities of daily living for at least 90 days 
due to a loss of functional capacity, (2) having a similar level of 
disability as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in 
consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or (3) 
requiring substantial supervision to protect such individual from 
threats to health and safety due to severe cognitive impairment. 
Activities of daily living are eating, toileting, transferring, 
bathing, dressing and continence. Nothing in the bill requires the 
contract to take into account all of the activities of daily living.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The payor of a payment to which this provision applies is 
required to report to the IRS the aggregate amount of such 
benefits paid to any individual during any calendar year, and 
the name, address and taxpayer identification number of such 
individual. A copy of the report must be provided to the payee 
by January 31 following the year of payment, showing the name 
of the payer and the aggregate amount of such benefits paid to 
the individual during the calendar year. Failure to file the 
report or provide the copy to the payee is subject to the 
generally applicable penalties for failure to file similar 
information reports.
      A qualified viatical settlement provider is any person 
that regularly purchases or takes assignments of life insurance 
contracts on the lives of the terminally ill individuals and 
either (1) is licensed for such purposes in the State in which 
the insured resides; or (2) if the person is not required to be 
licensed by that State, menets the requirements of sections 8 
and 9 of the Viatical Settlements Model Act (issued by the 
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)), and 
also meets the section of the NAIC Viatical Settlements Model 
Regulation relating to standards for evaluation of reasonable 
payments, including discount rates, in determining amounts paid 
by the viatical settlement provider.
      For life insurance company tax purposes, the bill 
provides that a life insurance contract is treated as including 
a reference to a qualified accelerated death benefit rider to a 
life insurance contract (except in the case of any rider that 
is treated as a long-term care insurance contract under section 
7702B, as added by the bill). A qualified accelerated death 
benefit rider is any rider on a life insurance contract that 
provides only for payments of a type that are excludable under 
this provision.
            Effective date
      The provision applies to amounts received after December 
31, 1996. The provision treating a qualified accelerated death 
benefit rider as life insurance for life insurance company tax 
purposes takes effect on January 1, 1997. The issuance of a 
qualified accelerated death benefit rider to a life insurance 
contract, or the addition of any provision required to conform 
an accelerated death benefit rider to these provisions, is not 
treated as a modification or material change to the contract 
(and is not intended to affect the issue date of any contract 
under section 101(f)).
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill, 
except that, in the case of a chronically ill insured, while 
the Senate amendment does provide that the exclusion for 
amounts received under a life insurance contract applies if the 
amount is received under a rider or other provision of the 
contract that is treated as a long-term care insurance contract 
under section 7702B (as added by the bill), the Senate 
amendment does not include the explicit language of the House 
bill requiring that the amount be treated as a payment for 
long-term care services under section 7702B.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement follows the House bill and the 
Senate amendment, with technical modifications and 
clarifications.
      The conference agreement provides that the amount paid 
for the sale or assignment of any portion of the death benefit 
under a life insurance contract on the life of a terminally or 
chronically ill individual to a viatical settlement provider is 
excludable by the recipient as an amount paid under the 
contract by reason of the death of the insured. For example, 
the sale or assignment of a life insurance contract that has a 
rider providing for long-term care insurance, payments under 
which rider are funded by and reduce the death benefit, is 
considered the sale or assignment of the death benefit. Sale or 
assignment of a stand-alone rider providing for long-term care 
insurance (where payments under the rider are not funded by 
reductions in the death benefit), however, is not considered 
the sale or assignment of the death benefit.
      The conference agreement provides that a viatical 
settlement provider is any person regularly engaged in the 
trade or business of purchasing or taking assignments of life 
insurance contracts on the lives of insured individuals who are 
terminally ill or chronically ill, so long as the viatical 
settlement provider meets certain requirements. The viatical 
settlement provider must either (1) be licensed, in the State 
where the insured resides, to engage in such transactions with 
terminally ill individuals (if the insured is terminally ill) 
or with chronically ill individuals (if the insured is 
chronically ill), or (2) if such licensing with respect to the 
insured individual is not required in the State, meet other 
requirements depending on whether the insured is terminally or 
chronically ill. If the insured is terminally ill, the viatical 
settlement provider must meet the requirements of sections 8 
and 9 of the Viatical Settlements Model Act, relating to 
disclosure and general rules (issued by the National 
Association of Insurance Commissioner (NAIC)), and also meet 
the section of the NAIC Viatical Settlements Model Regulation 
relating to standards for evaluation of reasonable payments, 
including discount rates, in determining amounts paid by the 
viatical settlement provider. If the insured is chronically 
ill, the viatical settlement provider must meet requirements 
similar to those of sections 8 and 9 of the NAIC Viatical 
Settlements Model Act, and also must meet the standards, if 
any, promulgated by the NAIC for evaluating the reasonableness 
of amounts paid in viatical settlement transactions with 
chronically ill individuals.
      The conference agreement clarifies the rules for 
chronically ill insureds so that the tax treatment of payments 
with respect to chronically ill individuals is reasonably 
similar under the long-term care rules of the bill and under 
this provision. In the case of a chronically ill individual, 
the exclusion under this provision with respect to amounts paid 
under a life insurance contract and amounts paid in a sale or 
assignment to a viatical settlement provider applies if the 
payment received is for costs incurred by the payee (not 
compensated by insurance or otherwise) for qualified long-term 
care services (as defined under the long-term care rules of the 
bill) for the insured person for the period, and two other 
requirements (similar to requirements applicable to long-term 
care insurance contracts under the bill) are met. The first 
requirement is that under the terms of the contract giving rise 
to the payment, the payment is not a payment or reimbursement 
of expenses reimbursable under Medicare (except where Medicare 
is a secondary payor under the arrangement, or the arrangement 
provides for per diem or other periodic payments without regard 
to expenses for qualified long-term care services). The 
conference agreement provides that no provision of law shall be 
construed or applied so as to prohibit the offering of such a 
contract giving rise to such a payment on the basis that the 
contract coordinates its payments with those provided under 
Medicare. The second requirement is that the arrangement 
complies with those consumer protection provisions applicable 
under the bill to long-term care insurance contracts and 
issuers that are specified in Treasury regulations. It is 
intended that such guidance incorporate rules similar to those 
of section 6F (relating to right to return, permitting the 
payee 30 days to rescind the arrangement) of the NAIC Long-Term 
Care Insurance Model Act, and section 13 (relating to 
requirements for application, requiring that the payee be asked 
if he or she already has long-term care insurance, Medicaid, or 
similar coverage) of the NAIC Long-Term Care Insurance Model 
Regulations. If the NAIC or the State in which the policyholder 
resides issues standards relating to chronically ill 
individuals, then the analogous requirements under Treasury 
regulations cease to apply.
      An individual who meets the definition of a terminally 
ill individual is not treated as chronically ill, for purposes 
of this provision.
      Payments made on a per diem or other periodic basis, 
without regard to expenses incurred for qualified long-term 
care services, are nevertheless excludable under this 
provision, subject to the dollar cap on excludable benefits 
that applies for amounts that are excludable under per diem 
type long-term care insurance contracts. The conference 
agreement modifies the calculation of the dollar cap applicable 
to aggregate payments under per diem type long-term care 
insurance contracts and amounts received with respect to a 
chronically ill individual pursuant to a life insurance 
contract.\17\ The amount of the dollar cap with respect to the 
aggregate amount received under per diem type long-term care 
insurance contracts and this provision with respect to any one 
chronically ill individual (who is not terminally ill) is $175 
per day ($63,875 annually) (indexed), reduced by the amount of 
reimbursements and payments received by anyone for the cost of 
qualified long-term care services for the chronically ill 
individual. If more than one payee receives payments with 
respect to any one chronically ill individual, the amount of 
the dollar cap is utilized first by the chronically ill person, 
and any remaining amount is allocated in accordance with 
Treasury regulations. If payments under such contracts exceed 
the dollar cap, then the excess is excludable only to the 
extent of actual costs incurred for long-term care services. 
Amounts in excess of the dollar cap, with respect to which no 
actual costs (in excess of the dollar cap) were incurred for 
long-term care services, are fully includable in income without 
regard to rules relating to return of basis under Code section 
72.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ See item C, above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The conference agreement modifies the reporting 
requirement for payors of amounts excludable under the 
provision. Thus, in addition to the reporting requirements of 
the House bill, a payor is required to report the name, 
address, and taxpayer identification number of the chronically 
ill individual on account of whose condition such amounts are 
paid, and whether the contract under which the amount is paid 
is a per diem-type contract.

    e. exemption from income tax for state-sponsored organizations 
  providing health coverage for high-risk individuals; exemption from 
   income tax for state-sponsored workers' compensation reinsurance 
                             organizations

      (Sec. 341 of the House bill and sec. 451 of the Senate 
amendment).
Present law
      In general, the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') takes 
the position that organizations that provide insurance for 
their members or other individuals are not considered to be 
engaged in a tax-exempt activity. The IRS maintains that such 
insurance activity is either (1) a regular business of a kind 
ordinarily carried on for profit, or (2) an economy or 
convenience in the conduct of members' businesses because it 
relieves the members from obtaining insurance on an individual 
basis.
      Certain insurance risk pools have qualified for tax 
exemption under Code section 501(c)(6). In general, these 
organizations (1) assign any insurance policies and 
administrative functions to their member organizations 
(although they may reimburse their members for amounts paid and 
expenses), (2) serve an important common business interest of 
their members, and (3) must be membership organizations 
financed, at least in part, by membership dues.
      State insurance risk pools may also qualify for tax-
exempt status under section 501(c)(4) as a social welfare 
organization or under section 115 as serving an essential 
governmental function of a State. In seeking qualification 
under section 501(c)(4), insurance organizations generally are 
constrained by the restrictions on the provision of 
``commercial-type insurance'' contained in section 501(m). 
Section 115 generally provides that gross income does not 
include income derived from the exercise of any essential 
governmental function and accruing to a State or any political 
subdivision thereof. However, the IRS may be reluctant to rule 
that particular State risk-pooling entities satisfy the section 
501(c)(4) or 115 requirements for tax-exempt status.
House bill
            Health coverage for high-risk individuals
      The House bill provides tax-exempt status to any 
membership organization that is established by a State 
exclusively to provide coverage for medical care on a nonprofit 
basis to certain high-risk individuals, provided certain 
criteria are satisfied.\18\ The organization may provide 
coverage for medical care either by issuing insurance itself or 
by entering into an arrangement with a health maintenance 
organization (``HMO'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ No inference is intended as to the tax treatment of other 
types of State-sponsored organizations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      High-risk individuals eligible to receive medical care 
coverage from the organization must be residents of the State 
who, due to a pre-existing medical condition, are unable to 
obtain health coverage for such condition through insurance or 
an HMO, or are able to acquire such coverage only at a rate 
that is substantially higher than the rate charged for such 
coverage by the organization. The State must determine the 
composition of membership in the organization. For example, a 
State could mandate that all organizations that are subject to 
insurance regulation by the State must be members of the 
organization.
      The House bill further requires the State or members of 
the organization to fund the liabilities of the organization to 
the extent that premiums charged to eligible individuals are 
insufficient to cover such liabilities. Finally, no part of the 
net earnings of the organization can inure to the benefit of 
any private shareholder or individual.
      Effective date.--The provision applies to taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1996.
            Workers' compensation reinsurance organizations
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment is the same as the House bill.
Conference agreement
            Health coverage for high-risk individuals
      The conference agreement follows the House bill and the 
Senate amendment.
            Workers' compensation reinsurance organizations
      The conference agreement provides tax-exempt status to 
any membership organization that is established by a State 
before June 1, 1996, exclusively to reimburse its members for 
workers' compensation insurance losses, and that satisfies 
certain other conditions. A State must require that the 
membership of the organization consist of all persons who issue 
insurance covering workers' compensation losses in such State, 
and all persons and governmental entities who self-insure 
against such losses. In addition, the organization must operate 
as a nonprofit organization by returning surplus income to 
members or to workers' compensation policyholders on a periodic 
basis and by reducing initial premiums in anticipation of 
investment income.
      Effective date.--The provision applies to taxable years 
ending after the date of enactment.

 f. health insurance organizations eligible for benefits of section 833

      (Sec. 351 of the House bill).
Present law
      An organization described in sections 501(c)(3) or (4) of 
the Code is exempt from tax only if no substantial part of its 
activities consists of providing commercial-type insurance 
(sec. 501(m)). Special rules apply to certain eligible health 
insurance organizations. Eligible health insurance 
organizations are (1) Blue Cross and Blue Shield organizations 
existing on August 16, 1986, which have not experienced a 
material change in structure or operations since that date, and 
(2) other organizations that meet certain community-service 
related requirements and substantially all of whose activities 
involve the providing of health insurance. Section 833 provides 
that eligible organizations are generally treated as stock 
property and casualty insurance companies.
      Section 833 provides a special deduction for eligible 
organizations, equal to 25 percent of the claims and expenses 
incurred during the year, less the adjusted surplus at the 
beginning of the year. This deduction is calculated by 
computing surplus, taxable income, claims incurred, expenses 
incurred, tax-exempt income, net operating loss carryovers, and 
other items attributable to health expenses. The deduction may 
not exceed taxable income attributable to health business for 
the year (calculated without regard to this deduction).
      In addition, section 833 eliminates, for eligible 
organizations, the 20 percent reduction in unearned premium 
reserves that applies generally to all property and casualty 
insurance companies.
House bill
      The House bill applies the special rules under section 
833 to the same extent they are provided to certain existing 
Blue Cross or Blue Shield organizations, in the case of any 
organization that (1) is not a Blue Cross or Blue Shield 
organization existing on August 16, 1986, and (2) otherwise 
meets the requirements of section 833(c)(2) (including the 
requirement of no material change in operations or structure 
since August 16, 1986). Under the provision, an organization 
qualifies for this treatment only if (1) it is not a health 
maintenance organization and (2) it is organized under and 
governed by State laws which are specifically and exclusively 
applicable to not-for-profit health insurance or health service 
type organizations.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable 
years ending after December 31, 1996.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement follows the House bill.

       g. penalty-free withdrawals from iras for medical expenses

      (Sec. 461 of the Senate amendment).
Present law
      Amounts withdrawn from an individual retirement 
arrangement (``IRA'') are includible in income (except to the 
extent of any nondeductible contributions). In addition, a 10-
percent additional tax applies to withdrawals from IRAs made 
before age 59\1/2\, unless the withdrawal is made on account of 
death or disability or is made in the form of annuity payments.
      A similar additional tax applies to early withdrawals 
from employer-sponsored tax-qualified pension plans. However, 
the 10-percent additional tax does not apply to withdrawals 
from such plans to the extent used for medical expenses that 
exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income (``AGI'').
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment extends the exception to the 10-
percent tax for medical expenses in excess of 7.5 percent of 
AGI to withdrawals from IRAs. In addition, the Senate amendment 
provides that the 10-percent additional tax does not apply to 
withdrawals for medical insurance (without regard to the 7.5 
percent of AGI floor) if the individual (including a self-
employed individual) has received unemployment compensation 
under Federal or State law for at least 12 weeks, and the 
withdrawal is made in the year such unemployment compensation 
is received or the following year. If a self-employed 
individual is not eligible for unemployment compensation under 
applicable law, then, to the extent provided in regulations, a 
self-employed individual is treated as having received 
unemployment compensation for at least 12 weeks if the 
individual would have received unemployment compensation but 
for the fact that the individual was self-employed.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1996.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, 
with the modification that the exception ceases to apply if the 
individual has been reemployed for at least 60 days.

 h. require treasury to include organ and tissue donation information 
                            with tax refunds

      (Sec. 307 of the Senate amendment).
Present law
      There is no statutory requirement that Treasury include 
organ and tissue donation information with any payment of a 
refund of individual income taxes.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment requires Treasury to include organ 
and tissue donation information with any payment of a refund of 
individual income taxes made on or after February 1, 1997, 
through June 30, 1997.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective for refunds 
made on or after February 1, 1997, through June 30, 1997.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement generally follows the Senate 
amendment, with two technical modifications. The first 
modification requires that the organ donor card be included to 
the extent particable. The second modification clarifies that 
the organ donor card is to be included with the mailing of any 
payment of a refund of individual income taxes.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective for refunds 
made on or after February 1, 1997, through June 30, 1997.

Title IV. Application and Enforcement of Group Health Plan Requirements

   a. application and enforcement of group health plan portability, 
                 access, and renewability requirements

      (Sec. 104(b) of the House bill).
Present Law
      Under present law, the health care continuation rules 
(referred to as ``COBRA'' rules, after the Consolidated Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 in which they were enacted) 
require that most employer-sponsored group health plans must 
offer certain employees and their dependents (``qualified 
beneficiaries'') the option of purchasing continued health 
coverage in the case of certain qualifying events. These 
qualifying events include: termination or reduction in hours of 
employment, death, divorce or legal separation, enrollment in 
Medicare, or the end of a child's dependency under a parent's 
health plan. In general, the maximum period of COBRA coverage 
is 18 months. An employer is permitted to charge qualified 
beneficiaries 102 percent of the applicable premium for COBRA 
coverage.
      A tax is imposed on the failure of a group health plan to 
satisfy the COBRA rules. The tax may be imposed on the employer 
sponsoring the plan in the case of a plan other than a 
multiemployer plan, on the plan in the case of a multiemployer 
plan, or on each person who is responsible for administering or 
providing benefits under the plan if such person has, by 
written agreement, assumed responsibility for performing the 
act pursuant to which the violation occurs.
      The amount of the tax is generally equal to $100 per day 
for each day on which there is a violation. The tax applies 
separately with respect to each qualified beneficiary for whom 
a failure occurs. In general, a tax will not be imposed if the 
violation was unintentional and is corrected within 30 days. 
The maximum tax for unintentional violations that can be 
imposed for a taxable year generally is the lesser of (1) 10 
percent of the employer's payments under group health plans (or 
under the trust funding the plan in the case of a multiemployer 
plan), or (2) $500,000. If the tax is imposed on another person 
responsible for administering or providing benefits under the 
plan, the maximum penalty for failures during the year is $2 
million. The Secretary may waive all or part of the tax to the 
extent that payment of the tax would be excessive relative to 
the failure involved.
      Other than the COBRA rules, there are no other 
requirements in the Code which apply to group health plans (or 
insurers or health maintenance organizations (``HMOs'')) 
regarding portability through limitations on preexisting 
condition exclusions, prohibitions on excluding individuals 
from coverage based on health status, and guaranteed 
renewability of health plan coverage.
House bill
      Under the House bill, group health plans, insurers, and 
HMOs are subject to certain requirements regarding portability 
through limitations on preexisting condition exclusions and 
prohibitions on excluding individuals from coverage based on 
health status. The House bill generally extends the tax for 
failures to satisfy the COBRA rules to failures to comply with 
these requirements.
      No tax is imposed on an insurer or HMO that is governed 
under a State law that the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services has determined to provide enforcement of similar 
requirements. In addition, no tax may be imposed on a small 
employer (defined as an employer who employs at least 2, but 
fewer than 51 employees on a typical business day) that 
provides health care benefits through a contract with an 
insurer or HMO and the violation is solely because of the 
product offered by the insurer or HMO under such contract. In 
addition, no tax is imposed if there has been enforcement by 
the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services.
      Effective date.--The provision generally is effective 
with respect to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 
1998.
Senate amendment
      No provision. The requirements in the Senate amendment on 
group health plans, insurers, and HMOs regarding portability 
through limitations on preexisting condition exclusions and 
prohibitions on excluding individuals from coverage based on 
health status are not applied or enforced through the Code.
Conference agreement
      Under the conference agreement, group health plans are 
subject to certain requirements regarding portability through 
limitations on preexisting condition exclusions, prohibitions 
on excluding individuals from coverage based on health status, 
and guaranteed renewability of health insurance coverage.\19\ 
The conference agreement incorporates these requirements into 
the Code and generally imposes a tax with respect to any 
failure of a group health plan to comply with the requirements. 
The tax may generally be imposed on the employer sponsoring the 
plan. However, the tax may be imposed on the plan in the case 
of a multiemployer plan, and, with respect to violations of the 
requirements relating to guaranteed renewability, on the 
arrangement in the case of a multiple employer welfare 
arrangement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ These requirements are discussed earlier in greater detail.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The group health plan requirements contained in the Code 
do not apply to governmental plans and plans which on the first 
day of the plan year cover less than 2 current employees. In 
addition, no tax may be imposed on a small employer (defined as 
an employer who employed an average of 50 or fewer employees on 
business days during the preceding calendar year) that provides 
health care benefits through a contract with an insurer or HMO 
and the violation is solely because of the coverage offered by 
the insurer or HMO.
      The amount of the tax is generally equal to $100 per day 
for each day during which a failure occurs until the failure is 
corrected. The tax applies separately with respect to each 
individual affected by the failure. In general, a tax will not 
be imposed if the violation was unintentional and is corrected 
within 30 days.\20\ The maximum tax for unintentional 
violations that can be imposed generally is the lesser of (1) 
10 percent of the employer's payments during the taxable year 
in which the failure occurred under group health plans (or 10 
percent of the amount paid by the multiemployer plan or 
multiple employer welfare arrangement during the plan year in 
which the failure occurred for medical care, if applicable), or 
(2) $500,000. The Secretary may waive all or part of the tax to 
the extent that payment of the tax would be excessive relative 
to the failure involved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ In the case of a church plan, this correction is generally 
extended to 270 days after the date of mailing by the Secretary of a 
notice of default with respect to a failure to comply with the group 
health plan requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Effective date.--The provision applies with respect to 
failures of group health plans to satisfy the requirements 
regarding portability through limitations on preexisting 
condition exclusions, prohibitions on excluding individuals 
from coverage based on health status, and guaranteed 
renewability of health insurance coverage.

b. clarification of certain cobra health care continuation requirements

      (Sec. 121 of the Senate amendment).
Present law
      Under present law, the health care continuation rules 
(referred to as ``COBRA'' rules, after the Consolidated Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 in which they were enacted) 
require that most employer-sponsored group health plans must 
offer certain employees and their dependents (``qualified 
beneficiaries'') the option of purchasing continued health 
coverage in the case of certain qualifying events. These 
qualifying events include; termination or reduction in hours of 
employment, death, divorce or legal separation, enrollment in 
Medicare, or the end of a child's dependency under a parent's 
health plan. In general, the maximum period of COBRA coverage 
is 18 months. An employer is permitted to charge qualified 
beneficiaries 102 percent of the applicable premium for COBRA 
coverage. A $100 per day tax generally may be assessed against 
employers (plans in the case of multiemployer plans) for 
failures to comply with the COBRA rules, subject to certain 
exceptions and limitations.
      The 18-month maximum COBRA coverage period is extended to 
29 months if the qualified beneficiary is determined under the 
Social Security Act to have been disabled at the time of the 
qualifying event and the qualified beneficiary provides notice 
of such determination to the employer before the end of the 18-
month period. A qualified beneficiary has 60 days to notify the 
employer of a disability determination. During the 11-month 
period of extended COBRA coverage, the qualified beneficiary 
may be charged 150 percent of the applicable premium.
      COBRA coverage may be terminated before the 18-month 
maximum coverage period in the case of certain events. These 
include: the employer ceases to maintain any group health plan, 
the qualified beneficiary fails to pay the premium, the 
qualified beneficiary becomes covered under another group 
health plan with no preexisting condition limitation or 
exclusion, or the qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to 
Medicare.
      Under present law, the term qualified beneficiary only 
includes individuals who were either the spouse or the 
dependent of the covered employee at the time of the qualifying 
event.
      A group health plan is required to notify each covered 
employee and the covered employee's spouse of their COBRA 
rights upon commencement of participation in the plan. Further, 
the group health plan administrator must notify each qualified 
beneficiary of their COBRA rights within 14 days after 
notification of the occurrence of a qualifying event.
House bill
      No provision. However, the House bill modifies the COBRA 
rules so that the penalties applicable to failures to comply 
with the COBRA rules generally apply to failures to comply with 
the requirements in the House bill on group health plans, 
insurers, and health maintenance organizations (``HMOs'') 
regarding portability through limitations on preexisting 
condition exclusions and prohibitions on excluding individuals 
from coverage based on health status.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment modifies the COBRA rules by 
clarifying that the extended maximum COBRA coverage period of 
29 months in cases of disability also applies to the disabled 
qualified beneficiary of the covered employee. In addition, the 
Senate amendment provides the extended COBRA coverage if the 
disability exists at any time during the initial 18-month COBRA 
coverage period as opposed to requiring the disability to exist 
at the time of the qualifying event. As under present law, the 
disability determination still has to be made, and the notice 
of the disability still has to be given, before the end of the 
initial COBRA coverage period.
      The Senate amendment coordinates the COBRA rules with the 
new requirements regarding preexisting condition exclusions so 
that COBRA coverage can be terminated if a qualified 
beneficiary becomes covered under another group health plan, 
even if such group health plan contains a preexisting condition 
limitation or exclusion, provided the preexisting condition 
limitation or exclusion does not apply to the qualified 
beneficiary by reason of the new requirements restricting the 
application of preexisting condition limitations and 
exclusions.
      The Senate amendment also modifies the definition of 
qualified beneficiary to include a child born to our placed for 
adoption with the covered employee during the period of COBRA 
coverage. Consequently, since the health care availability 
provisions in the Senate amendment require group health plans 
to allow participants to change their coverage status (i.e., to 
change from individual coverage to family coverage, or to add 
on the new child) upon the birth or adoption of a new child, 
COBRA participants would also be allowed to change their 
coverage status upon the birth or adoption of a new child.
      The Senate amendment requires a group health plan to 
notify each qualified beneficiary who has elected COBRA 
coverage of the changes to the COBRA rules contained in the 
Senate amendment no later than November 1, 1996.
      Effective date.--The provision applies to qualifying 
events occurring on or after the date of enactment for plan 
years beginning after December 31, 1997.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, 
except the extended period of COBRA coverage in cases of 
disability applies if the disability exists at any time during 
the first 60 days of COBRA coverage.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective on January 1, 
1997, regardless of whether the qualifying event occurred 
before, on, or after such date.

                        TITLE V. REVENUE OFFSETS

   a. disallow interest deduction for corporate-owned life insurance 
                              policy loans

      (Sec. 495 of the Senate amendment).
 Present law
      No Federal income tax generally is imposed on a 
policyholder with respect to the earnings under a life 
insurance contract (``inside buildup''). \21\ Further, an 
exclusion from Federal income tax is provided for amounts 
received under a life insurance contract paid by reason of the 
death of the insured (sec. 101(a)). The policyholder may borrow 
with respect to the life insurance contract without affecting 
these exclusions, subject to certain limitations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ This favorable tax treatment is available only if a life 
insurance contract meets certain requirements designed to limit the 
investment character of the contract (sec. 7702). Distributions from a 
life insurance contract (other than a modified endowment contract) that 
are made prior to the death of the insured generally are includible in 
income, to the extent that the amounts distributed exceed the 
taxpayer's basis in the contract; such distributions generally are 
treated first as a tax-free recovery of basis, and then as income (sec. 
72(e)). In the case of a modified endowment contract, however, in 
general, distributions are treated as income first, loans are treated 
as distributions (i.e., income rather than basis recovery first), and 
an additional 10 percent tax is imposed on the income portion of 
distributions made before age 59\1/2\ and in certain other 
circumstances (secs. 72 (e) and (v)). A modified endowment contract is 
a life insurance contract that does not meet a statutory ``7-pay'' 
test, i.e., generally is funded more rapidly than 7 annual level 
premiums (sec. 7702A).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The limitations on borrowing with respect to a life 
insurance contract under present law provide that no deduction 
is allowed for any interest paid or accrued on any indebtedness 
with respect to one or more life insurance policies owned by 
the taxpayer covering the life of any individual who (1) is an 
officer or employee of, or (2) is financially interested in, 
any trade or business carried on by the taxpayer to the extent 
that the aggregate amount of such debt with respect to policies 
covering the individual exceeds $50,000 (sec. 264(a)(4)).
      Further, no deduction is allowed for any amount paid or 
accrued on debt incurred or continued to purchase or carry a 
life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract pursuant to a 
plan of purchase that contemplates the systematic direct or 
indirect borrowing of part or all of the increases in the cash 
value of the contract.\22\ An exception to the latter rule is 
provided, permitting deductibility of interest on bona fide 
debt that is part of such a plan, if no part of 4 of the annual 
premiums due during the first 7 years is paid by means of debt 
(the ``4-out-of-7 rule'') (sec. 264(c)(1)). Provided the 
transaction gives rise to debt for Federal income tax purposes, 
and provided the 4-out-of-7 rule is met,\23\ a company may 
under present law borrow up to $50,000 per employee, officer, 
or financially interested person to purchase or carry a life 
insurance contract covering such a person, and is not precluded 
under section 264 from deducting the interest on the debt, even 
though the earnings inside the life insurance contract (inside 
buildup) are tax-free, and in fact the taxpayer has full use of 
the borrowed funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ The statute provides that the $50,000 limitation applies only 
with respect to contracts purchased after June 20, 1986. However, 
additional limitations are imposed on the deductibility of interest 
with respect to single premium contracts (sec. 264(a)(2)), and on the 
deductibility of premiums paid on a life insurance contract covering 
the life of any officer or employee or person financially interested in 
a trade or business of the taxpayer when the taxpayer is directly or 
indirectly a beneficiary under the contract (sec. 264(a)(1)).
    \23\ Interest deductions are disallowed if any of the disallowance 
rules of section 264(a)(2)-(4) apply. The disallowance rule of section 
264(a)(3) is not applicable if one of the exceptions of section 264(c), 
such as the 4-out-of-7 rule (sec. 264(c)(1)) is satisfied. In addition 
to the specific disallowance rules of section 264, generally applicable 
principles of tax law apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Under the Senate amendment, no deduction is allowed for 
interest paid or accrued on any indebtedness with respect to 
one or more life insurance policies or annuity or endowment 
contracts owned by the taxpayer covering any individual who is 
(1) an officer or employee of, or (2) financially interested 
in, any trade or business carried on by the taxpayer, 
regardless of the aggregate amount of debt with respect to 
policies or contracts covering the individual.
      An exception is provided retaining present law for 
interest on indebtedness with respect to life insurance 
policies covering up to 10 key persons. A key person is an 
individual who is either an officer or a 20-percent owner of 
the taxpayer. The number of individuals that can be treated as 
key persons may not exceed the greater of (1) 5 individuals, or 
(2) the lesser of 5 percent of the total number of officers and 
employees of the taxpayer or 10 individuals. Interest paid or 
accrued on debt with respect to a life insurance contract 
covering a key person is deductible only to the extent the rate 
of interest does not exceed Moody's Corporate Bond Yield 
Average--Monthly Average Corporates for each month interest is 
paid or accrued.
      Effective date.--The Senate amendment provision generally 
is effective with respect to interest paid or accrued after 
December 31, 1995 (subject to a phase-in rule).
      The phase-in rule provides that with respect to debt 
incurred before January 1, 1996, any otherwise deductible 
interest paid or accrued after October 13, 1995, and before 
January 1, 1999, is allowed to the extent the rate of interest 
does not exceed the lesser of (1) the borrowing rate specified 
in the contract as of October 13, 1995, or (2) a percentage of 
Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average--Monthly Average 
Corporates for each month the interest is paid or accrued. For 
interest paid or accrued after October 13, 1995, and before 
January 1, 1996, the percentage of the Moody's rate is 100 
percent; for interest paid or accrued in 1996, the percentage 
is 90 percent; for interest paid or accrued in 1997, the 
percentage is 80 percent; for 1998, the percentage is 70 
percent; for 1999 and thereafter, the percentage is 0 percent. 
Only interest that would have been allowed as a deduction but 
for the provision is allowed under the phase-in. Interest that 
is deductible under the phase-in rules does not include 
interest on borrowings by the taxpayer with respect to 
contracts on the lives of more than 20,000 insured individuals, 
effective for interest paid or accrued after December 31, 1995. 
For this purpose, all persons treated as a single employer are 
treated as one taxpayer.
      An exception is provided under the effective date with 
respect to any life insurance contract entered into during 1994 
or 1995. In the case of such contracts, with respect to debt 
incurred before January 1, 1997, a deduction is allowed for 
interest (that is otherwise deductible) only (1) with respect 
to policies that satisfy the key person exception, and (2) as 
provided under the phase-in rule. Thus, with respect to 
interest on amounts borrowed during 1996 with respect to such a 
contract, the phase-in rule applies, capping the rate for 
determining the amount of deductible interest at the lesser of 
(1) the borrowing rate specified in the contract as of October 
13, 1995, or (2) the applicable percentage of Moody's Corporate 
Bond Yield Average--Monthly Average Corporates for each month 
the interest is paid or accrued. For example, for interest paid 
or accrued in 1996 on amounts borrowed in 1996 with respect to 
such a contract, the applicable percentage is 90 percent.
      The provision generally does not apply to interest on 
debt with respect to contracts purchased on or before June 20, 
1986 (thus generally continuing the effective date provision of 
the $50,000 limitation enacted in the 1986 Act.) If the policy 
loan interest rate under such a contract provides for a fixed 
rate of interest, then interest on such a contract paid or 
accrued after October 13, 1995, is allowable only to the extent 
the fixed rate of interest does not exceed Moody's Corporate 
Bond Yield Average--Monthly Average Corporates for the month in 
which the contract was purchased. If the policy loan interest 
rate under such a contract does not provide for a fixed rate of 
interest, then interest on such a contract paid or accrued 
after October 13, 1995, is allowable only to the extent the 
rate of interest for each fixed period selected by the taxpayer 
does not exceed Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average--Monthly 
Average Corporates, for the month immediately preceding the 
beginning of the fixed period. The fixed period must be 12 
months or less. It is intended that conforming a contract to 
satisfy this interest rate limitation not be treated as a 
material modification for purposes of this grandfather rule or 
sections 101(f), 7702 or 7702A. No inference is intended as to 
whether such a change is a material modification under present 
law.
      Any amount included in income during 1996, 1997, or 1998, 
that is received under a contract described in the proposal on 
the complete surrender, redemption or maturity of the contract 
or in full discharge of the obligation under the contract that 
is in the nature of a refund of the consideration paid for the 
contract, is includable ratably over the first 4 taxable years 
beginning with the taxable year the amount would otherwise have 
been includable. Utilization of this 4-year income-spreading 
rule does not cause interest paid or accrued prior to January 
1, 1999, to be nondeductible solely by reason of (1) failure to 
meet the 4-out-or-7 rule, or (2) causing the contract to be 
treated as single premium contract within the meaning of 
section 264(b)(1) (i.e., a contract in which substantially all 
of the premiums are paid within 4 years after the date of 
purchase). In addition, the lapse of a contract after October 
13, 1995, due to nonpayment of premiums does not cause interest 
paid or accrued prior to January 1, 1999, to be nondeductible 
solely by reason of (1) failure to meet the 4-out-of-7 rule, or 
(2) causing the contract to be treated as a single premium 
contract within the meaning of section 264(b)(1).
      In the case of an insurance company, the unamortized 
balance of policy expense attributable to a contract with 
respect to which the 4-year income-spreading treatment is 
allowed to the policyholder is deductible in the year in which 
the transaction giving rise to income-spreading occurs.
      No inference, is intended as to the treatment of interest 
paid or accrued under present law.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, 
with the following modifications.
      The exception relating to key persons is modified to 
apply to life insurance policies covering up to 20 key persons. 
Thus, under the conference agreement, the number of individuals 
that can be treated as key persons may not exceed the greater 
of (1) 5 individuals, or (2) the lesser of 5 percent of the 
total number of officers and employees of the taxpayer or 20 
individuals.
      The cap (based on Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average--
Monthly Average Corporates) on deductible interest paid or 
accrued with respect to (1) interest paid or accrued on debt 
with respect to a life insurance contract covering a key 
person, and (2) interest on debt with respect to contracts 
purchased on or before June 20, 1986, applies only for interest 
paid or accrued for any month beginning after December 31, 
1995.
      In addition, in the case of a contract purchased on or 
before June 20, 1986, where the policy loan interest rate under 
the contract does not provide for a fixed rate of interest, the 
interest is allowable only to the extent the rate of interest 
for each period does not exceed Moody's Corporate Bond Yield 
Average--Monthly Average Corporates for the third month 
preceding the first month preceding the period.
      Effective date.--The conference agreement modifies the 
percentages of the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average--
Monthly Average Corporates that apply with respect to qualified 
interest under the phase-in rule. Thus, under the conference 
agreement, the percentage of the Moody's rate is 100 percent 
for interest paid or accrued in 1996; 90 percent for interest 
paid or accrued in 1997; 80 percent for interest paid or 
accrued in 1998; and 0 percent thereafter. The rule limiting 
deductible interest to the applicable percentage of the Moody's 
rate does not apply for interest paid or accrued in any month 
beginning before January 1, 1996.

                     B. Expatriation Tax Provisions

      (Secs. 421-423 of the House bill and secs. 471-473 of the 
Senate amendment.)
Present law
      Individuals who relinquish U.S. citizenship with a 
principal purpose of avoiding U.S. taxes are subject to special 
tax provisions for 10 years after expatriation. The 
determination of who is a U.S. citizen for tax purposes, and 
when such citizenship is lost, is governed by the provisions of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. section 1401, et 
seq.
      An individual who relinquishes his U.S. citizenship with 
a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. taxes is subject to tax on 
his or her U.S. source income at the rates applicable to U.S. 
citizens, rather than the rates applicable to other non-
resident aliens, for 10 years after expatriation. In addition, 
the scope of items treated as U.S. source income for this 
purpose is broader than those items generally considered to be 
U.S. source income. For example, gains on the sale of personal 
property located in the United States and gains on the sale or 
exchange of stock or securities issued by U.S. persons are 
treated as U.S. source income. This alternative method of 
income taxation applies only if it results in higher U.S. tax 
liability.
       Rules applicable in the estate and gift tax contexts 
expand the categories of items that are subject to the gift and 
estate taxes in the case of a U.S. citizen who relinquished 
citizenship with a principal purpose of avoiding U.S. taxes 
within the 10-year period ending on the date of the transfer. 
For example, U.S. property held through a foreign corporation 
controlled by such individual and related persons is included 
in his or her estate and gifts of U.S.-situs intangible 
property by such individual are subject to the gift tax.
House bill
            Overview
      The House bill expands and substantially strengthens in 
several ways the present-law provisions that subject U.S. 
citizens who lose their citizenship for tax avoidance purposes 
to special tax rules for 10 years after such loss of 
citizenship (secs. 877, 2107, and 2501(a)(3)). First, the House 
bill extends the expatriation tax provisions to apply not only 
to U.S. citizens who lose their citizenship but also to certain 
long-term residents of the United States whose U.S. residency 
is terminated. Second, the House bill subjects certain 
individuals to the expatriation tax provisions without inquiry 
as to their motive for losing their U.S. citizenship or 
residency, but allows certain categories of citizens to show an 
absence of tax-avoidance motive if they request a ruling from 
the Secretary of the Treasury as to whether the loss of 
citizenship had a principal purpose of tax avoidance. Third, 
the House bill expands the categories of income and gains that 
are treated as U.S. source (and therefore subject to U.S. 
income tax under section 877) if earned by an individual who is 
subject to the expatriation tax provisions and includes 
provisions designed to eliminate the ability to engage in 
certain transactions that under current law partially or 
completely circumvent the 10-year reach of section 877. 
Further, the House bill provides relief from double taxation in 
circumstances where another country imposes tax on items that 
would be subject to U.S. tax under the expatriation tax 
provisions.
      The House bill also contains provisions to enhance 
compliance with the expatriation tax provisions. The House bill 
imposes information reporting obligations on U.S. citizens who 
lose their citizenship and long-term residents whose U.S. 
residency is terminated at the time of expatriation. In 
addition, the House bill directs the Treasury Department to 
undertake a study regarding compliance by individuals living 
abroad with their U.S. tax reporting obligations and to make 
recommendations with respect to improving such compliance.
            Individuals covered
      The present-law expatriation tax provisions apply only to 
certain U.S. citizens who lose their citizenship. The House 
bill extends these expatriation tax provisions to apply also to 
long-term residents of the United States whose U.S. residency 
is terminated. For this purpose, a long-term resident is any 
individual who was a lawful permanent resident of the United 
States for at least 8 out of the 15 taxable years ending with 
the year in which such termination occurs. In applying this 8-
year test, an individual is not considered to be a lawful 
permanent resident for any year in which the individual is 
taxed as a resident of another country under a treaty tie-
breaker rule. An individual's U.S. residency is considered to 
be terminated when either the individual ceases to be a lawful 
permanent resident pursuant to section 7701(b)(6) (i.e., the 
individual loses his or her green-card status) or the 
individual is treated as a resident of another country under a 
tie-breaker provision of a tax treaty (and the individual does 
not elect to waive the benefits of such treaty). Furthermore, a 
long-term resident may elect to use the fair market value basis 
of property on the date the individual became a U.S. resident 
(rather than the property's historical basis) to determine the 
amount of gain subject to the expatriation tax provisions if 
the asset is sold within the 10-year period.
      Under present law, the expatriation tax provisions are 
applicable to a U.S. citizen who loses his or her citizenship 
unless such loss did not have as a principal purpose the 
avoidance of taxes. Under the House bill, U.S. citizens who 
lose their citizenship and long-term residents whose U.S. 
residency is terminated are generally treated as having lost 
such citizenship or terminated such residency with a principal 
purpose of the avoidance of taxes if either: (1) the 
individual's average annual U.S. Federal income tax liability 
for the 5 taxable years ending before the date of such loss or 
termination is greater than $100,000 (the ``tax liability 
test''), or (2) the individual's net worth as of the date of 
such loss or termination is $500,000 or more (the ``net worth 
test''). The dollar amount thresholds contained in the tax 
liability test and the net worth test are indexed for inflation 
in the case of a loss of citizenship or termination of 
residency occurring in any calendar year after 1996. An 
individual who falls below the thresholds specified in both the 
tax liability test and the net worth test is subject to the 
expatriation tax provisions unless the individual's loss of 
citizenship or termination of residency did not have as a 
principal purpose the avoidance of tax (as under present law in 
the case of U.S. citizens).
      A U.S. citizen, who loses his or her citizenship and who 
satisfies either the tax liability test or the net worth test, 
is not subject to the expatriation tax provisions if such 
individual can demonstrate that he or she did not have a 
principal purpose of tax avoidance and the individual is within 
one of the following categories: (1) the individual was born 
with dual citizenship and retains only the non-U.S. 
citizenship; (2) the individual becomes a citizen of the 
country in which the individual, the individual's spouse, or 
one of the individual's parents, was born; (3) the individual 
was present in the United States for no more than 30 days 
during any year in the 10-year period immediately preceding the 
date of his or her loss of citizenship; (4) the individual 
relinquishes his or her citizenship before reaching age 18\1/
2\; or (5) any other category of individuals prescribed by 
Treasury regulations. In all of these situations, the 
individual would have been subject to tax on his or her 
worldwide income (as are all U.S. citizens) until the time of 
expatriation. In order to qualify for one of these exceptions, 
the former U.S. citizen must, within one year from the date of 
loss of citizenship, submit a ruling request for a 
determination by the Secretary of the Treasury as to whether 
such loss had as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of 
taxes. A former U.S. citizen who submits such a ruling request 
is entitled to challenge an adverse determination by the 
Secretary of the Treasury. However, a former U.S. citizen who 
fails to submit a timely ruling request is not eligible for 
these exceptions. It is expected that in making a determination 
as to the presence of a principal purpose of tax avoidance, the 
Secretary of the Treasury will take into account factors such 
as the substantiality of the former citizen's ties to the 
United States (including ownership of U.S. assets) prior to 
expatriation, the retention of U.S. citizenship by the former 
citizen's spouse, and the extent to which the former citizen 
resides in a country that imposes little or no tax.
      The foregoing exceptions are not available to long-term 
residents whose U.S. residency is terminated. However, the 
House bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to 
prescribe regulations to exempt certain categories of long-term 
residents from the House bill's provisions.
            Items subject to section 877
      Under section 877, an individual covered by the 
expatriation tax provisions is subject to tax on U.S. source 
income and gains for a 10-year period after expatriation at the 
graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens.\24\ The tax under 
section 877 applies to U.S. source income and gains of the 
individual for the 10-year period, without regard to whether 
the property giving rise to such income or gains was acquired 
before or after the date the individual became subject to the 
expatriation tax provisions. For example, a U.S. citizen who 
inherits an appreciated asset immediately before losing 
citizenship and disposes of the asset immediately after such 
loss would not recognize any taxable gain on such disposition 
(because of the date of death fair market value basis accorded 
to inherited assets), but the individual would continue to be 
subject to tax under section 877 on the income or gain derived 
from any U.S. property acquired with the proceeds from such 
disposition.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \24\ Under present law, all nonresident aliens (including 
expatriates) are subject to U.S. income tax at graduated rates on 
certain types of income. Such income includes income effectively 
connected with a U.S. trade or business and gains from the disposition 
of interests in U.S. real property. For example, compensation 
(including deferred compensation) paid with respect to services 
performed in the United States is subject to such tax. Thus, under 
current law, a U.S. citizen who earns a stock option while employed in 
the United States and delays the exercise of such option until after 
such individual loses his or her citizenship is subject to U.S. tax on 
the compensation income recognized upon exercise of the stock option 
(even if the stock received upon the exercise is stock in a foreign 
corporation).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      In addition, section 877 currently recharacterizes as 
U.S. source income certain gains of individuals who are subject 
to the expatriation tax provisions, thereby subjecting such 
individuals to U.S. income tax on such gains. Under this rule, 
gain on the sale or exchange of stock of a U.S. corporation or 
debt of a U.S. person is treated as U.S. source income. In this 
regard, under current law, the substitution of a foreign 
obligor for a U.S. obligor is generally treated as a taxable 
exchange of the debt instrument, and therefore any gain on such 
exchange is subject to tax under section 877. The House bill 
extends this recharacterization to income and gains derived 
from property obtained in certain transactions on which gain or 
loss is not recognized under present law. An individual covered 
by section 877 who exchanges property that would produce U.S. 
source income for property that would produce foreign source 
income is required to recognize immediately as U.S. source 
income any gain on such exchange (determined as if the property 
had been sold for its fair market value on such date). To the 
extent gain is recognized under this provision, the property 
would be accorded the step-up in basis provided under current 
law. This rule requiring immediate gain recognition does not 
apply if the individual enters into an agreement with the 
Secretary of the Treasury specifying that any income or gains 
derived from the property received in the exchange during the 
10-year period after the loss of citizenship (or termination of 
U.S. residency, as applicable) would be treated as U.S. source 
income. Such a gain recognition agreement terminates if the 
property transferred in the exchange is disposed of by the 
acquiror, and any gain that had not been recognized by reason 
of such agreement is recognized as U.S. source as of such date. 
It is expected that a gain recognition agreement would be 
entered into not later than the due date for the tax return for 
the year of the exchange. In this regard, the Secretary of the 
Treasury is authorized to issue regulations providing similar 
treatment for nonrecognition transactions that occur within 5 
years immediately prior to the date of loss of citizenship (or 
termination of U.S. residency, as applicable).
      The Secretary of Treasury is authorized to issue 
regulations to treat removal of tangible personal property from 
the United States, and other circumstances that result in a 
conversion of U.S. source income to foreign source income 
without recognition of any unrealized gain, as exchanges for 
purposes of computing gain subject to section 877. The taxpayer 
may defer the recognition of the gain if he or she enters into 
a gain recognition agreement as described above. For example, a 
former citizen who removes appreciated artwork that he or she 
owns from the United States could be subject to immediate tax 
on the appreciation under this provision unless the individual 
enters into a gain recognition agreement.
      The foregoing rules regarding the treatment under section 
877 of nonrecognition transactions are illustrated by the 
following examples: Ms. A loses her U.S. citizenship on January 
1, 1996, and is subject to section 877. On June 30, 1997, Ms. A 
transfers the stock she owns in a U.S. corporation, USCo, to a 
wholly-owned foreign corporation, FCo, in a transaction that 
qualifies for tax-free treatment under section 351. At the time 
of such transfer, A's basis in the stock of USCo is $100,000 
and the fair market value of the stock is $150,000. Under 
present law, Ms. A. would not be subject to U.S. tax on the 
$50,000 of gain realized on the exchange. Moreover, Ms. A would 
not be subject to U.S. tax on any distribution of the proceeds 
from a subsequent disposition of the USCo stock by FCo. Under 
the House bill, if Ms. A does not enter into a gain recognition 
agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury, Ms. A would be 
deemed to have sold the USCo stock for $150,000 on the date of 
the transfer, and would be subject to U.S. tax in 1997 on the 
$50,000 of gain realized. Alternatively, if Ms. A enters into a 
gain recognition agreement, she would not be required to 
recognize for U.S. tax purposes in 1997 the $50,000 of gain 
realized upon the transfer of the USCo stock to FCo. However, 
under the gain recognition agreement, for the 10-year period 
ending on December 31, 2005, any income (e.g., dividends) or 
gain with respect to the FCo stock would be treated as U.S. 
source, and therefore Ms. A would be subject to tax on such 
income or gain under section 877. If FCo disposes of the USCo 
stock on January 1, 2002, Ms. A's gain recognition agreement 
would terminate on such date, and Ms. A would be required to 
recognize as U.S. source income at that time the $50,000 of 
gain that she previously deferred under the gain recognition 
agreement. (The amount of gain required to be recognized by Ms. 
A in this situation would not be affected by any changes in the 
value of the USCo stock since her June 30, 1997 transfer of 
such stock to FCo.)
      The House bill also extends the recharacterization rules 
of section 877 to treat as U.S. source any income and gains 
derived from stock in a foreign corporation if the individual 
losing citizenship or terminating residency owns, directly or 
indirectly, more than 50 percent of the vote or value of the 
stock of the corporation on the date of such loss or 
termination or at any time during the 2 years preceding such 
date. Such income and gains are recharacterized as U.S. source 
only to the extent of the amount of earnings and profits 
attributable to such stock earned or accumulated prior to the 
date of loss of citizenship (or termination of residency, as 
applicable) and while such ownership requirement is satisfied.
      The following example illustrates this rule: Mr. B loses 
his U.S. citizenship on July 1, 1996 and is subject to section 
877. Mr. B has owned all of the stock of a foreign corporation, 
FCo, since its incorporation in 1991. As of FCo's December 31, 
1995 year-end, FCo has accumulated earnings and profits of 
$500,000. FCo has earnings and profits of $100,000 for 1996 and 
does not have any subpart F income (as defined in sec. 952). 
FCo makes a $100,000 distribution to Mr. B in each of 1997 and 
1998. On January 1, 1999, Mr. B disposes of all his stock of 
FCo and realizes $400,000 of gain. Under present law, neither 
the distributions from FCo nor the gain on the disposition of 
the FCo stock would be subject to U.S. tax. Under the House 
bill, the distributions from FCo and the gain on the sale of 
the stock of FCo would be treated as U.S. source income and 
would be taxed to Mr. B under section 877, subject to the 
earnings and profits limitation. For this purpose, the amount 
of FCo's earnings and profits for 1996 is prorated based on the 
number of days during 1996 that Mr. B is a U.S. citizen. Thus, 
the amount of FCo's earnings and profits earned or accumulated 
before Mr. B's loss of citizenship is $550,000. Accordingly, 
the $100,000 distributions from FCo in 1997 and 1998 would be 
treated as U.S. source income taxable to Mr. B under section 
877 in such years. In addition, $350,000 of the gain realized 
from the sale of the stock of FCo in 1999 would be treated as 
U.S. source income taxable to Mr. B under section 877 in that 
year.
            Special rule for shift in risks of ownership
      Section 877 applies to income and gains for the 10-year 
period following the loss of citizenship (or termination of 
residency, as applicable). For purposes of applying section 
877, the House bill suspends this 10-year period for gains 
derived from a particular property during any period in which 
the individual's risk of loss with respect to such property is 
substantially diminished. For example, Ms. C loses her 
citizenship on January 1, 1996 and is subject to section 877. 
On that date Ms. C owns 10,000 shares of stock of a U.S. 
corporation, USCo, with a value of $1 million. On the same date 
Ms. C enters into an equity swap with respect to such USCo 
stock with a 5-year term. Under the transaction, Ms. C will 
transfer to the counter-party an amount equal to the dividends 
on the USCo stock and any increase in the value of the USCo 
stock for the 5-year period. The counter-party will transfer to 
Ms. C an amount equal to a market rate of interest on $1 
million and any decrease in the value of the USCo stock for the 
same period. Ms. C's risk of loss with respect to the USCo 
stock is substantially diminished during the 5-year period in 
which the equity swap is in effect, and therefore, under the 
House bill, the 10-year period under section 877 is suspended 
during such period. Accordingly, under the House bill, if Ms. C 
sells her USCo stock for a gain on January 1, 2010, such gain 
would be treated as U.S. source income taxable to Ms. C under 
section 877. Such gain would not be subject to U.S. tax under 
present law.
            Double tax relief
      In order to avoid the double taxation of individuals 
subject to the expatriation tax provisions, the House bill 
provides a credit against the U.S. tax imposed under such 
provisions for any foreign income, gift, estate or similar 
taxes paid with respect to the items subject to such taxation. 
This credit is available only against the tax imposed solely as 
a result of the expatriation tax provisions, and is not 
available to be used to offset any other U.S. tax liability. 
For example, Mr. D loses his citizenship on January 1, 1996 and 
is subject to section 877. Mr. D becomes a resident of Country 
X. During 1996, Mr. D recognizes a $100,000 gain upon the sale 
of stock of a U.S. corporation, USCo. Country X imposes $20,000 
tax on this capital gain. But for the double tax relief 
provision, Mr. D would be subject to tax of $28,000 on this 
gain under section 877. However, Mr. D's U.S. tax under section 
877 would be reduced by the $20,000 of foreign tax paid, and 
Mr. D's resulting U.S. tax on this gain would be $8,000.
            Effect on tax treaties
      While it is believed that the expatriation tax 
provisions, as amended by the House bill, are generally 
consistent with the underlying principles of income tax 
treaties to the extent the House bill provides a foreign tax 
credit for items taxed by another country, it is intended that 
the purpose of the expatriation tax provisions, as amended, not 
be defeated by any treaty provision. The Treasury Department is 
expected to review all outstanding treaties to determine 
whether the expatriation tax provisions, as revised, 
potentially conflict with treaty provisions and to eliminate 
any such potential conflicts through renegotiation of the 
affected treaties as necessary. Beginning on the tenth 
anniversary of the enactment of the House bill, any conflicting 
treaty provisions that remain in force would take precedence 
over the expatriation tax provisions as revised.
            Required information reporting and sharing
      Under the House bill, a U.S. citizen who loses his or her 
citizenship is required to provide a statement to the State 
Department (or other designated government entity) which 
includes the individual's social security number, forwarding 
foreign address, new country of residence and citizenship and, 
in the case of individuals with a net worth of at least 
$500,000, a balance sheet. The entity to which such statement 
is to be provided is required to provide the Secretary of the 
Treasury copies of all statements received and the names of 
individuals who refuse to provide such statements. A long-term 
resident whose U.S. residency is terminated is required to 
attach a similar statement to his or her U.S. income tax return 
for the year of such termination. An individual's failure to 
provide the required statement results in the imposition of a 
penalty for each year the failure continues equal to the 
greater of (1) 5 percent of the individual's expatriation tax 
liability for such year, or (2) $1,000.
      The House bill requires the State Department to provide 
the Secretary of the Treasury with a copy of each certificate 
of loss of nationality (CLN) approved by the State Department. 
Similarly, the House bill requires the agency administering the 
immigration laws to provide the Secretary of the Treasury with 
the name of each individual whose status as a lawful permanent 
resident has been revoked or has been determined to have been 
abandoned.
      Further, the House bill requires the Secretary of the 
Treasury to publish in the Federal Register the names of all 
former U.S. citizens from whom it receives the required 
statements or whose names it receives under the foregoing 
information-sharing provisions.
            Treasury report on tax compliance by U.S. citizens and 
                    residents living abroad
      The Treasury Department is directed to undertake a study 
on the tax compliance of U.S. citizens and green-card holders 
residing outside the United States and to make recommendations 
regarding the improvement of such compliance. The findings of 
such study and such recommendations are required to be reported 
to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate 
Committee on Finance within 90 days of the date of enactment.
      During the course of the 1995 Joint Committee on Taxation 
staff study on expatriation (see Joint Committee on Taxation, 
Issues Presented by Proposals to Modify the Tax Treatment of 
Expatriation (JCS-17-95), June 1, 1995), a specific issue was 
identified regarding the difficulty in determining when a U.S. 
citizen has committed an expatriating act with the requisite 
intent, and thus no longer has the obligation to continue to 
pay U.S. taxes on his or her worldwide income due to the fact 
that the individual is no longer a U.S. citizen. Neither the 
Immigration and Nationality Act nor any other Federal law 
requires an individual to request a CLN within a specified 
amount of time after an expatriating act has been committed, 
even though the expatriating act terminates the status of the 
individual as a U.S. citizen for all purposes, including the 
status of being subject to U.S. tax on worldwide income. 
Accordingly, it is anticipated that the Treasury report, in 
evaluating whether improved coordination between executive 
branch agencies could improve compliance with the requirements 
of the Internal Revenue Code, will review the process through 
which the State Department determines when citizenship has been 
lost, and make recommendations regarding changes to such 
process to recognize the importance of such date for tax 
purposes. In particular, it is anticipated that the Treasury 
Department will explore ways of working with the State 
Department to insure that the State Department will not issue a 
CLN confirming the commission of an expatriating act with the 
requisite intent necessary to terminate citizenship in the 
absence of adequate evidence of both the occurrence of the 
expatriating act (e.g., the joining of a foreign army) and the 
existence of the requisite intent.
            Effective date
      The expatriation tax provisions as modified by the House 
bill generally apply to any individual who loses U.S. 
citizenship, and any long-term residents whose U.S. residency 
is terminated, on or after February 6, 1995. For citizens, the 
determination of the date of loss of citizenship remains the 
same as under present law (i.e., the date of loss of 
citizenship is the date of the expatriating act). However, a 
special transition rule applies to individuals who committed an 
expatriating act within one year prior to February 6, 1995, but 
had not applied for a CLN as of such date. Such an individual 
is subject to the expatriation tax provisions as amended by the 
House bill as of the date of application for the CLN, but is 
not retroactively liable for U.S. income taxes on his or her 
worldwide income. In order to qualify for the exceptions 
provided for individuals who fall within one of the specified 
categories, such individual is required to submit a ruling 
request within 1 year after the date of enactment of the House 
bill.
      The special transition rule is illustrated by the 
following example. Mr. E joined a foreign army on October 1, 
1994 with the intent to relinquish his U.S. citizenship, but 
Mr. E does not apply for a CLN until October 1, 1995. Mr. E 
would be subject to the expatriation tax provisions (as 
amended) for the 10-year period beginning on October 1, 1995. 
Moreover, if Mr. E falls within one of the specified categories 
(i.e., Mr. E is age 18 when he joins the foreign army), in 
order to qualify for the exception provided for such 
individuals, Mr. E would be required to submit his ruling 
request within 1 year after the date of enactment of the House 
bill. Mr. E would not, however, be liable for U.S. income taxes 
on his worldwide income for any period after October 1, 1994.
Senate amendment
            In general
      The Senate amendment replaces the present-law 
expatriation income tax rules with rules that generally subject 
certain U.S. citizens who relinquish their U.S. citizenship and 
certain long-term U.S. residents who relinquish their U.S. 
residency to tax on the net unrealized gain in their property 
as if such property were sold for fair market value on the 
expatriation date. The Senate amendment also imposes 
information reporting obligations on U.S. citizens who 
relinquish their citizenship and long-term residents whose U.S. 
residency is terminated.
            Individuals covered
      The Senate amendment applies the expatriation tax to 
certain U.S. citizens and long-term residents who terminate 
their U.S. citizenship or residency. For this purpose, a long-
term resident is any individual who was a lawful permanent 
resident of the United States for at least 8 out of the 15 
taxable years ending with the year in which the termination of 
residency occurs. In applying this 8-year test, an individual 
is not considered to be a lawful permanent resident of the 
United States for any year in which the individual is taxed as 
a resident of another country under a treaty tie-breaker rule. 
An individual's U.S. residency is considered to be terminated 
when either the individual ceases to be a lawful permanent 
resident pursuant to section 7701(b)(6) (i.e., the individual 
loses his or her green-card status) or the individual is 
treated as a resident of another country under a tie-breaker 
provision of a tax treaty (and the individual does not elect to 
waive the benefits of such treaty).
      The expatriation tax under the Senate amendment applies 
only to individuals whose average income tax liability or net 
worth exceeds specified levels. U.S. citizens who lose their 
citizenship and long-term residents who terminate U.S. 
residency are subject to the expatriation tax if they meet 
either of the following tests: (1) the individual's average 
annual U.S. Federal income tax liability for the 5 taxable 
years ending before the date of such loss or termination is 
greater than $100,000, or (2) the individual's net worth as of 
the date of such loss or termination is $500,000 or more. The 
dollar amount thresholds contained in these tests are indexed 
for inflation in the case of a loss of citizenship or 
termination of residency occurring in any calendar year after 
1996.
      Exceptions from the expatriation tax under the Senate 
amendment are provided for individuals in two situations. The 
first exception applies to an individual who was born with 
citizenship both in the United States and in another country, 
provided that (1) as of the date of relinquishment of U.S. 
citizenship the individual continues to be a citizen of, and is 
taxed as a resident of, such other country, and (2) the 
individual was a resident of the United States for no more than 
8 out of the 15 taxable years ending with the year in which the 
relinquishment of U.S. citizenship occurred. The second 
exception applies to a U.S. citizen who relinquishes 
citizenship before reaching age 18\1/2\, provided that the 
individual was a resident of the United States for no more than 
5 taxable years before such relinquishment.
            Deemed sale of property upon expatriation
      Under the Senate amendment, individuals who are subject 
to the expatriation tax generally are treated as having sold 
all of their property at fair market value immediately prior to 
the relinquishment of citizenship or termination of residency. 
Gain or loss from the deemed sale of property is recognized at 
that time, generally without regard to provisions of the Code 
that would otherwise provide nonrecognition treatment. The net 
gain, if any, on the deemed said of all such property is 
subject to U.S. tax at such time to the extent it exceeds 
$600,000 ($1.2 million in the case of married individuals 
filing a joint return, both of whom expatriate).
      The deemed sale rule of the Senate amendment generally 
applies to all property interests held by the individual on the 
date of relinquishment of citizenship or termination of 
residency, provided that the gain on such property interest 
would be includible in the individual's gross income if such 
property interest were sold for its fair market value on such 
date. Special rules apply in the case of trust interests (see 
``Interests in trusts,'' below). U.S. real property interests, 
which remain subject to U.S. taxing jurisdiction in the hands 
of nonresident aliens, generally are excepted from the Senate 
amendment. An exception also applies to interests in qualified 
retirement plans and, subject to a limit of $500,000, interests 
in certain foreign pension plans as prescribed by regulations. 
The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue 
regulations exempting other property interests as appropriate. 
For example, an exclusion may be provided for an interest in a 
nonqualified compensation plan of a U.S. employer, where 
payments from such plan to the individual following 
expatriation would continue to be subject to U.S. withholding 
tax.
      Under the Senate amendment, an individual who is subject 
to the expatriation tax is required to pay a tentative tax 
equal to the amount of tax that would be due for a hypothetical 
short tax year ending on the date the individual relinquished 
citizenship or terminated residency. Thus, the tentative tax is 
based on all income, gain, deductions, loss and credits of the 
individual for the year through such date, including amounts 
realized from the deemed sale of property. The tentative tax is 
due on the 90th day after the date of relinquishment of 
citizenship or termination of residency.
            Deferral of payment of tax
      Under the Senate amendment, an individual is permitted to 
elect to defer payment of the expatriation tax with respect to 
the deemed sale of any property. Under this election, the 
expatriation tax with respect to a particular property, plus 
interest thereon, is due when the property is subsequently 
disposed of. For this purpose, except as provided in 
regulations, the disposition of property in a nonrecognition 
transaction constitutes a disposition. In addition, if an 
individual holds property until his or her death, the 
individual is treated as having disposed of the property 
immediately before death. In order to elect deferral of the 
expatriation tax, the individual is required to provide 
adequate security to ensure that the deferred expatriation tax 
and interest ultimately will be paid. A bond in the amount of 
the deferred tax and interest constitutes adequate security. 
Other security mechanisms are also permitted provided that the 
individual establishes to the satisfaction of the Security of 
the Treasury that the security is adequate. In the event that 
the security provided with respect to a particular property 
subsequently becomes inadequate and the individual fails to 
correct such situation, the deferred expatriation tax and 
interest with respect to such property will become due. As a 
further condition to making this election, the individual is 
required to consent to the waiver of any treaty rights that 
would preclude the collection of the expatriation tax.
            Interests in trusts
      In general.--Under the Senate amendment, special rules 
apply to trust interests held by the individual at the time of 
relinquishment of citizenship or termination of residency. The 
treatment of trust interests depends upon whether the trust is 
a qualified trust. For this purpose, a ``qualified trust'' is a 
trust that is organized under and governed by U.S. law and that 
is required by its instruments to have at least one U.S. 
trustee.
      Constructive ownership rules apply to a trust beneficiary 
that is a corporation, partnership, trust or estate. In such 
cases, the shareholders, partners or beneficiaries of the 
entity are deemed to be the direct beneficiaries of the trust 
for purposes of applying these provisions. In addition, an 
individual who holds (or who is treated as holding) a trust 
interest at the time of relinquishment of citizenship or 
termination of residency is required to disclose on his or her 
tax return the methodology used to determine his or her 
interest in the trust, and whether such individual knows (or 
has reason to know) that any other beneficiary of the trust 
uses a different method.
      Nonqualified trusts.--If an individual holds an interest 
in a trust that is not a qualified trust, a special rule 
applies for purposes of determining the amount of the 
expatriation tax due with respect to such trust interest. The 
individuals interest in the trust is treated as a separate 
trust consisting of the trust assets allocable to such 
interest. Such separate trust is treated as having sold its 
assets as of the date of relinquishment of citizenship or 
termination of residency and having distributed all proceeds to 
the individual, and the individual is treated as having 
recontributed such proceeds to the trust. The individual is 
subject to the expatriation tax with respect to any net income 
or gain arising from the deemed distribution from the trust. 
The election to defer payment is available for the expatriation 
tax attributable to a nonqualifed trust interest.
      A beneficiary's interest in a nonqualified trust is 
determined on the basis of all facts and circumstances. These 
include the terms of the trust instrument itself, any letter of 
wishes or similar document, historical patterns of trust 
distributions, and the role of any trust protector or similar 
advisor.
      Qualified trusts.--If the individual has an interest in a 
qualified trust, a different set of rules applies. Under these 
rules, the amount of unrealized gain allocable to the 
individual's trust interest is calculated at the time of 
expatriation. In determining this amount, all contingencies and 
discretionary interests are assumed to be resolved in the 
individual's favor (i.e., the individual is allocated the 
maximum amount that he or she potentially could receive under 
the terms of the trust instrument). The expatriation tax 
imposed on such gains generally is collected when the 
individual receives distributions from the trust, or, if 
earlier, upon the individual's death. Interest is charged for 
the period between the date of expatriation and the date on 
which the tax is paid.
      If an individual has an interest in a qualified trust, 
the individual is subject to expatriation tax upon the receipt 
of any distribution from the trust. Such distributions may also 
be subject to U.S. income tax. For any distribution from a 
qualified trust made to an individual after he or she has 
expatriated, expatriation tax is imposed in an amount equal to 
the amount of the distribution multiplied by the highest tax 
rate generally applicable to trusts and estates, but in no 
event will the tax imposed exceed the deferred tax amount with 
respect to such trust interest. The ``deferred tax amount'' 
would be equal to (1) the tax calculated with respect to the 
unrealized gain allocable to the trust interest at the time of 
expatriation, (2) increased by interest thereon, and (3) 
reduced by the tax imposed under this provision with respect to 
prior trust distributions to the individual.
      If an individual's interest in a trust is vested as of 
the expatriation date (e.g., if the individual's interest in 
the trust is non-contingent and non-discretionary), the gain 
allocable to the individual's trust interest is determined 
based on the truth assets allocable to his or her trust 
interest. If the individual's interest in the trust is not 
vested as of the expatriation date (e.g., if the individual's 
trust interest is a contingent or discretionary interest), the 
gain allocable to his or her trust interest is determined based 
on all of the trust assets that could be allocable to his or 
her trust interest, determined by resolving all contingencies 
and discretionary powers in the individual's favor. In the case 
where more than one trust beneficiary is subject to the 
expatriation tax with respect to trust interests that are not 
vested, the rules are intended to apply so that the same 
unrealized gain with respect to assets in the trust is not 
taxed to both individuals.
      If the individual disposes of his or her trust interest, 
the trust ceases to be a qualified trust, or the individual 
dies, expatriation tax is imposed as of such date. The amount 
of such tax equal to the lesser of (1) the tax calculated under 
the rules for nonqualified trust interests applied as of such 
date or (2) the deferred tax amount with respect to the trust 
interest as of such date.
      If the individual agrees to waive any treaty rights that 
would preclude collection of the tax, the tax is imposed under 
this provision with respect to distributions from a qualified 
trust to the individual deducted and withheld from 
distributions. If the individual does not agree to such a 
waiver of treaty rights, the tax with respect to distributions 
to the individual is imposed on the trust, the trustee is 
personally liable therefore, and any other beneficiary of the 
trust has a right of contribution against such individual with 
respect to such tax. Similarly, in the case of the tax imposed 
in connection with an individual's disposition of a trust 
interest, the individual's death while holding a trust interest 
or the individual's holding of an interest in a trust that 
ceases to be qualified, the tax is imposed on the trust, the 
trustee is personnaly liable therefor, and any other 
beneficiary of the trust has a right of contribution against 
such individual with respect to such tax.
            Election to be treated as a U.S. citizen
      Under the Senate amendment, an individual is permitted to 
make an irrevocable election to continue to be taxed as a U.S. 
citizen with respect to all property that otherwise is covered 
by the expatriation tax. This election is an ``all-or-nothing'' 
election; an individual is not permitted to elect this 
treatment for some property but not other property. The 
election, if made, applies to all property that would be 
subject to the expatriation tax and to any property the basis 
of which is determined by reference to such property. Under 
this election, the individual continues to pay U.S. income 
taxes at the rates applicable to U.S. citizens following 
expatriation on any income generated by the property and on any 
gain realized on the disposition of the property, as well as 
any excise tax imposed with respect to property (see, e.g., 
sec. 1491). In addition, the property continues to be subject 
to U.S. gift, estate, and generation-shipping taxes. However, 
the amount of any transfer tax so imposed is limited to the 
amount of income tax that would have been due if the property 
had been sold for its fair market value immediately before the 
transfer or death. The $600,000 exclusion provided with respect 
to the expatriation tax under the Senate amendment is available 
to reduce the tax imposed by reason of this election. In order 
to make this election, the taxpayer is required to waive any 
treaty rights that would preclude the collection of the tax. 
The individual is also required to provide security to ensure 
payment of the tax under this election in such form, manner, 
and amount as the Secretary of the Treasury requires.
            Date of relinquishment of citizenship
      Under the Senate amendment, as individual is treated as 
having relinquished U.S. citizenship on the date that the 
individual first makes known to U.S. government of consular 
officer his or her intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship. 
Thus, a U.S. citizen who relinquishes citizenship by formally 
renouncing his or her U.S. nationality before a diplomatic or 
consular officer for the United States is treated as having 
relinquished ciizenship on that date, provided that the 
renunciation is later confirmed by the issuance of a CLN. A 
U.S. citizen who furnishes to the State Department a signed 
statement of voluntary relinquishment of U.S. nationality 
confirming the performance of an expatriating act with the 
requisite interest to relinquish his or her citizenship is 
treated as having relinquished his or her citizenship on the 
date the statement is so furnished (regardless of when the 
expatriating act was performed), provided that the voluntary 
relinquishment is later confirmed by the issuance of a CLN. If 
neither of these circumstances exist, the individual is treated 
as having relinquished citizenship on the date a CLN is issued 
or a certificate of naturalization is cancelled. The date of 
relinquishment of citizenship determined under the Senate 
amendment applies for all purposes.
            Effect on present-law expatriation provisions
      Under the Senate amendment, the present-law income tax 
provisions with respect to U.S. citizens who expatriate with a 
principal purpose of avoiding tax (sec. 877) and certain aliens 
who have a break in residency status (sec. 7701(b)(10)) do 
applying to U.S. citizens who are treated as relinquishing 
their citizenship on or after February 6, 1995 or to long-term 
U.S. residents who terminate their residency on or after such 
date. The special estate and gift tax provisions with respect 
to individuals who expatriate with a principal purpose of 
avoiding tax (secs. 2107 and 2501(a)(3)), however, continue to 
apply; a credit against the tax imposed solely by reason of 
such special provisions is allowed for the expatriation tax 
imposed with respect to the same property.
            Treatment of gifts and inheritances from an expatriate
      Under the Senate amendment, the exclusion from income 
provided in section 102 does not apply to the value of any 
property received by gift or inheritance from an individual who 
was subject to the expatriation tax (i.e., an individual who 
relinquished citizenship or terminated residency and to whom 
the expatriation tax was applicable). Accordingly, a U.S. 
taxpayer who receives a gift or inheritance from such an 
individual is required to include the value of such gift or 
inheritance in gross income and is subject to U.S. income tax 
on such amount.
            Required information reporting and sharing
      Under the Senate amendment, an individual who 
relinquishes citizenship or terminates residency is required to 
provide a statement which includes the individual's social 
security number, forwarding foreign address, new country of 
residence and citizenship and, in the case of individuals with 
a net worth of at least $500,000, a balance sheet. In the case 
of a former citizen, such statement is due not later than the 
date the individual's citizenship is treated as relinquished 
and is to be provided to the State Department (or other 
government entity involved in the administration of such 
relinquishment). The entity to which the statement is to be 
provided by former citizens is required to provide to the 
Secretary of the Treasury copies of all statements received and 
the names of individuals who refuse to provide such statements. 
In the case of a former long-term resident, the statement is 
provided to the Secretary of the Treasury with the individual's 
tax return for the year in which the individual's U.S. 
residency is terminated. An individual's failure to provide the 
statement required under this provision results in the 
imposition of a penalty for each year the failure continues 
equal to the greater of (1) 5 percent of the individual's 
expatriation tax liability for such year or (2) $1,000.
      The Senate amendment requires the State Department to 
provide the Secretary of the Treasury with a copy of each CLN 
approved by the State Department. Similarly, the Senate 
amendment requires the agency administering the immigration 
laws to provide the Secretary of the Treasury with the name of 
each individual whose status as a lawful permanent resident has 
been revoked or has been determined to have been abandoned.
      Further, the Senate amendment requires the Secretary of 
the Treasury to publish in the Federal Register the names of 
all former U.S. citizens with respect to whom it receives the 
required statements or whose names it receives under the 
foregoing information-sharing provisions.
            Treasury report on tax compliance by U.S. citizens and 
                    residents living abroad
      The Treasury Department is directed to undertake a study 
on the tax compliance of U.S. citizens and green-card holders 
residing outside the United States and to make recommendations 
regarding the improvement of such compliance. The findings of 
such study and such recommendations are required to be reported 
to the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate 
Committee on Finance within 90 days of the date of enactment.
            Effective date
      The provision is effective for U.S. citizens whose date 
of relinquishment of citizenship (as determined under the 
Senate amendment, see ``Date of relinquishment of citizenship'' 
above) occurs on or after February 6, 1995. Similarly, the 
provision is effective for long-term residents who terminate 
their U.S. residency on or after February 6, 1995.
      U.S. citizens who committed an expatriating act with the 
requisite intent to relinquish their U.S. citizenship prior to 
February 6, 1995, but whose date of relinquishment of 
citizenship (as determined under the Senate amendment) does not 
occur until after such date, are subject to the expatriation 
tax under the Senate amendment as of date of relinquishment of 
citizenship. However, the individual is not subject 
retroactively to worldwide tax as a U.S. citizen for the period 
after he or she committed the expatriating act (and therefore 
ceased being a U.S. citizen for tax purposes under present 
law). Such an individual continues to be subject to the 
expatriation tax imposed by present-law section 877 until the 
individual's date of relinquishment of citizenship (at which 
time the individual would be subject to the expatriation tax of 
the Senate amendment). The rules described in this paragraph do 
not apply to an individual who committed an expatriating act 
prior to February 6, 1995, but did not do so with the requisite 
intent to relinquish his or her U.S. citizenship.
      The tentative tax is not required to be paid, and the 
reporting requirements would not be required to be met, until 
90 days after the date of enactment. Such provisions apply to 
all individuals whose date of relinquishment of U.S. 
citizenship or termination of U.S. residency occurs on or after 
February 6, 1995.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement follows the House bill with 
modifications. Under the conference agreement, modified rules 
apply if an individual who is covered by section 877 
contributes property that would produce U.S. source income to a 
foreign corporation if (1) the individual, directly or 
indirectly, owns 10 percent or more (by vote) of the stock of 
such corporation and (2) the individual, directly, indirectly 
or constructively, owns more than 50 percent (by vote or by 
value) of the stock of such corporation. For purposes of 
determining indirect and constructive ownership, the rules of 
section 958 apply. Under the modified rules, for the ten-year 
period following expatriation the individual is treated as 
receiving or accruing directly the income or gains received or 
accrued by the foreign corporation with respect to the 
contributed property (or other property which has a basis 
determined by reference to the basis of such contributed 
property). Moreover, if the individual disposes of the stock of 
the foreign corporation, the individual is subject to U.S. tax 
on the gain that would have been recognized if the corporation 
had sold such property immediately before the disposition. If 
the individual disposes of less than all of his or her stock in 
the foreign corporation, such disposition is treated as a 
disposition of a pro rata share (determined based on value) of 
such contributed property (e.g., if the individual owns 100 
shares of the foreign corporation's stock and disposes of 10 of 
such shares, such disposition is treated as a disposition of 10 
percent of the property contributed to the foreign 
corporation). Regulatory authority is provided to prescribe 
regulations to prevent the avoidance of this rule. Information 
reporting will be required as necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this rule. In addition, under the conference 
agreement, in the case of any former U.S. citizen, a request 
for a ruling that such individual did not have the avoidance of 
U.S. tax as a principal purpose for such individual's loss of 
citizenship would be due not earlier than 90 days after date of 
enactment.

       c. treatment of bad debt deductions of thrift institutions

      (Sec. 401 of the House bill and and sec. 611 of the 
Senate amendment.)
Present law
      Generally, a taxpayer engaged in a trade or business may 
deduct the amount of any debt that becomes wholly or partially 
worthless during the year (the ``specific charge-off'' method 
of sec. 166). Certain thrift institutions (building and loan 
associations, mutual savings banks, or cooperative banks) are 
allowed deductions for bad debts under methods more favorable 
than those granted to other taxpayers (and more favorable than 
the rules applicable to other financial institutions). 
Qualified thrift institutions may compute deductions for bad 
debts using either the specific charge-off method or the 
reserve method of section 593.
      Under section 593, a thrift institution annually may 
elect to deduct bad debts under either (1) the ``percentage of 
taxable income'' method applicable only to thrift institutions, 
or (2) the ``experience'' method that also is available to 
small banks. Under the ``percentage of taxable income'' method, 
a thrift institution generally is allowed a deduction for an 
addition to its bad debt reserve equal to 8 percent of its 
taxable income (determined without regard to this deduction and 
with additional adjustments). Under the experience method, a 
thrift institution generally is allowed a deduction for an 
addition to its bad debt reserve equal to the greater of: (1) 
an amount based on its actual average experience for losses in 
the current and five preceding taxable years, or (2) an amount 
necessary to restore the reserve to its balance as of the close 
of the base year.
      If a thrift institution becomes ineligible to use the 
section 593 method, it is required to change its method of 
accounting for bad debts and, under proposed Treasury 
regulations, is required to recapture all or a portion of its 
bad debt reserve. In addition, a thrift institution eligible to 
use the section 593 method may be subject to a form of reserve 
recapture if the institution makes certain excessive 
distributions to its shareholders (sec. 593(e)).
House bill
            Repeal of section 593
      The House bill repeals the section 593 reserve method of 
accounting for bad debts by thrift institutions, effective for 
taxable years beginning after 1995. Thrift institutions that 
would be treated as small banks are allowed to utilize the 
experience method applicable to such institutions, while thrift 
institutions that are treated as large banks are required to 
use only the specific charge-off method. Thus, the percentage 
of taxable income method of accounting for bad debts is no 
longer available for any financial institution.
            Treatment of recapture of bad debt reserves
      A thrift institution required to change its method of 
computing reserves for bad debts will treat such change as a 
change in a method of accounting, initiated by the taxpayer, 
and having been made with the consent of the Secretary of the 
Treasury. Any section 481(a) adjustment required to be 
recaptured with respect to such change generally will be 
determined solely with respect to the ``applicable excess 
reserves'' of the taxpayer. The amount of applicable excess 
reserves will be taken into account ratably over a six-taxable 
year period, beginning with the first taxable year beginning 
after 1995, subject to the residential loan requirement 
described below. In the case of a thrift institution that 
becomes a large bank, the amount of the institution's 
applicable excess reserves generally is the excess of (1) the 
balances of its reserve for losses on qualifying real property 
loans and its reserve for losses on nonqualifying loans as of 
the close of its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 
1996, over (2) the balances of such reserves as of the close of 
its last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1988 (i.e., 
the ``pre-1988 reserves.'') Similar rules are provided for 
small banks that are allowed to use the experience method.
      For taxable years that begin after December 31, 1995, and 
before January 1, 1998, if the taxpayer continues to make a 
certain level of residential loans, the recapture of the 
applicable excess reserves otherwise required to be taken into 
account for such years will be suspended.
      The balance of the pre-1988 reserves is subject to the 
provisions of section 593(e), as modified by the House bill 
(requiring recapture in the case of certain excessive 
distributions to shareholders.)
      Other special recapture rules are provided if a thrift 
institution no longer qualifies as a bank or if a thrift 
institution becomes a credit union.
            Effective date
      The provision generally is effective for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1995.
Senate amendment
      The Senate amendment generally is the same as the House 
bill, with certain modifications.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include either the 
provision in the House bill or the provision in the Senate 
amendment.

                   d. earned income credit provisions

      (Sec. 411 of the House bill.)
Present law
            In general
      Certain eligible low-income workers are entitled to claim 
a refundable credit on their income tax return. The amount of 
the credit an eligible individual may claim depends upon 
whether the individual has one, more than one or no qualifying 
children and is determined by multiplying the credit rate by 
the individual's \25\ earned income up to an earned income 
amount. The maximum amount of the credit is the product of the 
credit rate and the earned income amount. For individuals with 
earned income (or adjusted gross income (AGI), if greater) in 
excess of the beginning of the phaseout range, the maximum 
credit amount is reduced by the phaseout rate multiplied by the 
amount of earned income (or AGI, if greater) in excess of the 
beginning of the phaseout range. For individuals with earned 
income (or AGI, if greater) in excess of the end of the 
phaseout range, no credit is allowed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \25\ In the case of a married individual who files a joint return 
with his or her spouse, the income for purposes of these tests is the 
combined income of the couple.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      The parameters for the credit depend upon the number of 
qualifying children the individual claims. For 1996, the 
parameters are given in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Two or more      One           No    
                                    qualifying   qualifying   qualifying
                                    children--    child--     children--
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credit rate (percent)............        40.00        34.00         7.65
Earned income amount.............       $8,890       $6,330       $4,220
Maximum credit...................       $3,356       $2,152         $323
Phaseout begins..................      $11,610      $11,610       $5,280
Phaseout rate (percent)..........        21.06        15.98         7.65
Phaseout ends....................      $28,495      $25,078       $9,500
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      For years after 1996, the credit rates and the phaseout 
rates will be the same as in the preceding table. The earned 
income amount and the beginning of the phaseout range are 
indexed for inflation; because the end of the phaseout range 
depends on those amounts as well as the phaseout rate and the 
credit rate, the end of the phaseout range will also increase 
if there is inflation.
      In order to claim the credit, an individual must either 
have a qualifying child or meet other requirements. A 
qualifying child must meet a relationship test, an age test, an 
identification test, and a residence test. In order to claim 
the credit without a qualifying child, an individual must not 
be a dependent and must be over age 24 and under age 65.
      To satisfy the identification test, individuals must 
include on their tax return the name and age of each qualifying 
child. For returns filed with respect to tax year 1996, 
individuals must provide a taxpayer identification number (TIN) 
for all qualifying children born on or before November 30, 
1996. For returns filed with respect to tax year 1997 and all 
subsequent years, individuals must provide TINs for all 
qualifying children, regardless of their age. An individual's 
TIN is generally that individual's social security number.
            Mathematical or clerical errors
      The IRS may summarily assess additional tax due as a 
result of a mathematical or clerical error without sending the 
taxpayer a notice of deficiency and giving the taxpayer an 
opportunity to petition the Tax Court. Where the IRS uses the 
summary assessment procedure for mathematical or clerical 
errors, the taxpayer must be given an explanation of the 
asserted error and a period of 60 days to request that the IRS 
abate its assessment. The IRS may not proceed to collect the 
amount of the assessment until the taxpayer has agreed to it or 
has allowed the 60-day period for objecting to expire. If the 
taxpayer files a request for abatement of the assessment 
specified in the notice, the IRS must abate the assessment. Any 
reassessment of the abated amount is subject to the ordinary 
deficiency procedures. The request for abatement of the 
assessment is the only procedure a taxpayer may use prior to 
paying the assessed amount in order to contest an assessment 
arising out of a mathematical or clerical error. Once the 
assessment is satisfied, however, the taxpayer may file a claim 
for refund if he or she believes the assessment was made in 
error.
House bill
      Under the House bill, individuals are not eligible for 
the credit if they do not include their taxpayer identification 
number (and, if married, their spouse's taxpayer identification 
number) on their tax return. Solely for these purposes and for 
purposes of the present-law identification test for a 
qualifying child, a taxpayer identification number is defined 
as a social security number issued to an individual by the 
Social Security Administration other than a number issued under 
section 205(c)(2)(B)(i)(II) (or that portion of sec. 
205(c)(2)(B)(i)(III) relating to it) of the Social Security Act 
(regarding the issuance of a number to an individual applying 
for or receiving Federally funded benefits).
      If an individual fails to provide a correct taxpayer 
identification number, such omission will be treated as a 
mathematical or clerical error. If an individual who claims the 
credit with respect to net earnings from self-employment fails 
to pay the proper amount of self-employment tax on such net 
earnings, the failure will be treated as a mathematical or 
clerical error for purposes of the amount of credit allowed.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1995.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the House bill 
provision.

                 e. modify treatment of foreign trusts

      (Secs. 601-606 of the Senate amendment).
Present law
            Inbound grantor trusts with foreign grantors
      Under the grantor trust rules (secs. 671-679), a grantor 
that retains certain rights or powers generally is treated as 
the owner of the trust's assets without regard to whether the 
grantor is a domestic or foreign person. Under these rules, 
U.S. trust beneficiaries are not subject to U.S. tax on 
distributions from a trust where a foreign grantor is treated 
as owner of the trust, even though no tax may be imposed on the 
trust income by any jurisdiction. In addition, a special rule 
provides that if a U.S. beneficiary of an inbound grantor trust 
transfers property to the foreign grantor by gift, that U.S. 
beneficiary is treated as the grantor of the trust to the 
extent of the transfer.
            Foreign trusts that are not grantor trusts
      Under the accumulation distribution rules (which 
generally apply to distributions from a trust in excess of the 
trust's distributable net income for the taxable year), a 
distribution by a foreign nongrantor trust of previously 
accumulated income generally is taxed at the U.S. beneficiary's 
average marginal rate for the prior 5 years, plus interest 
(secs. 666 and 667). Interest is computed at a fixed annual 
rate of 6 percent, with no compounding (sec. 668). If adequate 
records of the trust are not available to determine the proper 
application of the rules relating to accumulation distributions 
to any distribution from a trust, the distribution is treated 
as an accumulation distribution out of income earned during the 
first year of the trust (sec. 666(d)).
      If a foreign nongrantor trust makes a loan to one of its 
beneficiaries, the principal of such a loan generally is not 
taxable as income to the beneficiary.
            Outbound foreign grantor trusts with U.S. grantors
      Under the grantor trust rules, a U.S. person that 
transfers property to a foreign trust generally is treated as 
the owner of the portion of the trust comprising that property 
for any taxable year in which there is a U.S. beneficiary of 
any portion of the trust (sec. 679(a)). This treatment 
generally does not apply, however, to transfers by reason of 
death, to transfers made before the transferor became a U.S. 
person, or to transfers that represent sales or exchanges of 
property at fair market value where gain is recognized to the 
transferor.
            Residence of trusts and estates
      An estate or trust is treated as foreign if it is not 
subject to U.S. income taxation on its income that is neither 
derived from U.S. sources nor effectively connected with the 
conduct of a U.S. trade or business. Thus, if a trust is taxed 
in a manner similar to a nonresident alien individual, it is 
considered to be a foreign trust. Any other trust is treated as 
domestic.
      Section 1491 generally imposes a 35-percent excise tax on 
a U.S. person that transfers appreciated property to certain 
foreign entities, including a foreign trust. In the case of a 
domestic trust that changes its situs and becomes a foreign 
trust, it is unclear whether property has been transferred from 
a U.S. person to a foreign entity and, thus, whether the 
transfer is subject to the excise tax.
            Information reporting and penalties related to foreign 
                    trusts
      Any U.S. person that creates a foreign trust or transfers 
money or property to a foreign trust is required to report that 
event to the Treasury Department without regard to whether the 
trust is a grantor trust or a nongrantor trust. Similarly, any 
U.S. person that transfers property to a foreign trust that has 
one or more U.S. beneficiaries is required to report annually 
to the Treasury Department. In addition, any U.S. person that 
makes a transfer described in section 1491 is required to 
report the transfer to the Treasury Department.
      Any person that fails to file a required report with 
respect to the creation of, or a transfer to, a foreign trust 
may be subject to a penalty of 5 percent of the amount 
transferred to the foreign trust. Similarly, any person that 
fails to file a required annual report with respect to a 
foreign trust with U.S. beneficiaries may be subject to a 
penalty of 5 percent of the value of the corpus of the trust at 
the close of the taxable year. The maximum amount of the 
penalty imposed under either case may not exceed $1,000. A 
reasonable cause exception is available.
            Reporting of foreign gifts
      There is no requirement to report gifts or bequests from 
foreign sources.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
            Inbound grantor trusts with foreign grantors
      The Senate amendment generally applies the grantor trust 
rules only to the extent that they result, directly or 
indirectly, in income or other amounts being currently taken 
into account in computing the income of a U.S. citizen or 
resident or a domestic corporation. Certain exceptions apply to 
this general rule. Under one exception, the grantor trust rules 
continue to apply to a revocable trust. Under another 
exception, the grantor trust rules continue to apply to a trust 
where the only amounts distributable during the lifetime of the 
grantor are to the grantor or the grantor's spouse. The general 
rule denying grantor trust status does not apply to trusts 
established to pay compensation, and certain trusts in 
existence as of September 19, 1995 provided that such trust is 
treated as owned by the grantor under section 676 or 677 (other 
than sec. 677(a)(3)).\26\ In addition, the grantor trust rules 
generally apply where the grantor is a controlled foreign 
corporation (as defined in sec. 957). Finally, the grantor 
trust rules continue to apply in determining whether a foreign 
corporation is characterized as a passive foreign investment 
company (``PFIC''). Thus, a foreign corporation cannot avoid 
PFIC status by transferring its assets to a grantor trust.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \26\ The exception does not apply to the portion of any such trust 
attributable to any transfers made after September 19, 1995.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
      If a U.S. beneficiary of an inbound grantor trust 
transfers property to the foreign grantor, such beneficiary 
generally is treated as a grantor of a portion of the trust to 
the extent of the transfer. This rule applies without regard to 
whether the foreign grantor is otherwise treated as the owner 
of any portion of such trust. However, this rule does not apply 
if the transfer is a gift that qualifies for the annual 
exclusion described in section 2503(b).
      The Senate amendment provides a special rule that allows 
the Secretary of the Treasury to recharacterize a transfer, 
directly or indirectly, from a partnership or foreign 
corporation which the transferee treats as a gift or bequest, 
to prevent the avoidance of the purpose of section 672(f). In a 
case where a foreign person (that would be treated as the owner 
of a trust but for the above rule) actually pays tax on the 
income of the trust to a foreign country, it is anticipated 
that Treasury regulations will provide that, for foreign tax 
credit purposes, U.S. beneficiaries that are subject to U.S. 
income tax on the same income will be treated as having paid 
the foreign taxes that are paid by the foreign grantor. Any 
resulting foreign tax credits will be subject to applicable 
foreign tax credit limitations.
      Effective date.--The provisions described in this part 
are effective on the date of enactment.
            Foreign trusts that are not grantor trusts
      The Senate amendment changes the interest rate applicable 
to accumulation distributions from foreign trusts from simple 
interest at a fixed rate of 6 percent to compound interest 
determined in the same manner as interest imposed on 
underpayments of tax under section 6621(a)(2). Simple interest 
is accrued at the rate of 6 percent through 1995. Beginning on 
January 1, 1996 compound interest based on the underpayment 
rate is imposed on tax amounts determined under the 
accumulation distribution rules and the total simple interest 
for pre-1996 periods, if any. For purposes of computing the 
interest charge, the accumulation distribution is allocated 
proportionately to prior trust years in which the trust has 
undistributed net income (and the beneficiary receiving the 
distribution was a U.S. citizen or resident), rather than to 
the earliest of such years. An accumulation distribution is 
treated as reducing proportionately the undistributed net 
income from prior years.
      In the case of a loan of cash or marketable securities by 
the foreign trust to a U.S. grantor or a U.S. beneficiary (or a 
U.S. person related to such grantor or beneficiary), except to 
the extent provided by Treasury regulations, the Senate 
amendment treats the full amount of the loan as distributed to 
the grantor or beneficiary. It is expected that the Treasury 
regulations will provide an exception from this treatment for 
loans with arm's-length terms. In applying this exception, it 
is further expected that consideration be given to whether 
there is a reasonable expectation that a loan will be repaid. 
In addition, any subsequent transaction between the trust and 
the original borrower regarding the principal of the loan 
(e.g., repayment) is disregarded for all purposes of the Code. 
This provision does not apply to loans made to persons that are 
exempt from U.S. income tax.
      Effective date.--The provision to modify the interest 
charge on accumulation distributions applies to distributions 
after the date of enactment. The provision with respect to 
loans to U.S. grantors, U.S. beneficiaries or a U.S. person 
related to such a grantor or beneficiary applies to loans made 
after September 19, 1995.
            Outbound foreign grantor trusts with U.S. grantors
      The Senate amendment makes several modifications to the 
general rule of section 679(a)(1) under which a U.S. person who 
transfers property to a foreign trust generally is treated as 
the owner of the portion of the trust comprising that property 
for any taxable year in which there is a U.S. beneficiary of 
the trust. The Senate amendment also conforms the definition of 
certain foreign corporations the income of which is deemed to 
be accumulated for the benefit of a U.S. beneficiary to the 
definition of controlled foreign corporations (as defined in 
sec. 957(a)).
      Sale or exchange at market value.--Present law contains 
several exceptions to grantor trust treatment under section 
679(a)(1) described above. Under one of the exceptions, grantor 
trust treatment does not result from a transfer of property by 
a U.S. person to a foreign trust in the form of a sale or 
exchange at fair market value where gain is recognized to the 
transferor. In determining whether the trust paid fair market 
value to the transferor, the Senator amendment provides that 
obligations issued (or, to the extent provided by regulations, 
guaranteed) by the trust, by any grantor or beneficiary of the 
trust, or by any person related to any grantor or beneficiary 
(referred to as ``trust obligations'') are not taken into 
account except as provided in Treasury regulations. It is 
expected that the Treasury regulations will provide an 
exception from this treatment for loans with arm's-length 
terms. In applying this exception, it is further expected that 
consideration be given to whether there is a reasonable 
expectation that a loan will be repaid. Principal payments by 
the trust on any such trust obligations generally will reduce 
the portion of the trust attributable to the property 
transferred (i.e., the portion of which the transferor is 
treated as the grantor).
      Other transfers.--The Senate amendment adds a new 
exception to the general rule of section 679(a)(1) described 
above. Under the Senate amendment, a transfer of property to 
certain charitable trusts is exempt from the application of the 
rules treating foreign trusts with U.S. grantors and U.S. 
beneficiaries as grantor trusts.
      Transferors or beneficiaries who become U.S. persons.--
The Senate amendment applies the rule of section 679(a)(1) to 
certain foreign persons who transfer property to a foreign 
trust and subsequently become U.S. persons. A nonresident alien 
individual who transfers property, directly or indirectly, to a 
foreign trust and then becomes a resident of the United States 
within 5 years after the transfer generally is treated as 
making a transfer to the foreign trust on the individual's U.S. 
residency starting date (as defined in sec. 7701(b)(2)(A)). The 
amount of the deemed transfer is the portion of the trust 
(including undistributed earnings) attributable to the property 
previously transferred. Consequently, the individual generally 
is treated under section 679(a)(1) as the owner of that portion 
of the trust in any taxable year in which the trust has U.S. 
beneficiaries.
      Outbound trust migrations.--The Senate amendment applies 
the rules of section 679(a)(1) to a U.S. person that 
transferred property to a domestic trust if the trust 
subsequently becomes a foreign trust while the transferor is 
still alive. Such a person is deemed to make a transfer to the 
foreign trust on the date of the migration. The amount of the 
deemed transfer is the portion of the trust (including 
undistributed earnings) attributable to the property previously 
transferred. Consequently, the individual generally is treated 
under the rules of section 679(a)(1) as the owner of that 
portion of the trust in any taxable year in which the trust has 
U.S. beneficiaries.
      Effective date.--The provisions to amend section 679 
apply to transfers of property after February 6, 1995.
            Anti-abuse regulatory authority
      The Senate amendment includes an anti-abuse rule which 
authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations, 
on or after the date of enactment, that may be necessary or 
appropriate to carry out the purposes of the rules applicable 
to estates, trusts and beneficiaries, including regulations to 
prevent the avoidance of those purposes.
      Effective date.--The provision is effective on the date 
of enactment.
            Residence of trusts and estates
      The Senate amendment establishes a two-part objective 
test for determining for tax purposes whether a trust is 
foreign or domestic. If both parts of the test are satisfied, 
the trust is treated as domestic. Only the first part of the 
test applies to estates. Under the first part of the test, if a 
U.S. court (i.e., Federal, State, or local) exercises primary 
supervision over the administration of a trust or estate, the 
trust or estate is treated as domestic. Under the second part 
of the test, in order for a trust to be treated as domestic, 
one or more U.S. fiduciaries must have the authority to control 
all substantial decisions of the trust.
      Under the Senate amendment, if a domestic trust changes 
its situs and becomes a foreign trust, the trust is treated as 
having made a transfer of its assets to a foreign trust and is 
subject to the 35-percent excise tax imposed by present-law 
section 1491 unless one of the exceptions to this excise tax is 
applicable.
      Effective date.--The provision to modify the treatment of 
a trust or estate as a U.S. person applies to taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1996. In addition, if the trustee 
of a trust so elects, the provision would apply to taxable 
years ending after the date of enactment. The amendment to 
section 1491 is effective on the date of enactment.
            Information reporting and penalties relating to foreign 
                    trusts
      The Senate amendment generally requires the grantor, 
transferor or executor (i.e., the ``responsible party'') to 
notify the Treasury Department upon the occurrence of certain 
reportable events. The term ``reportable event'' means the 
creation of any foreign trust by a U.S. person, the direct and 
indirect transfer of any money or property to a foreign trust, 
including a transfer by reason of death, and the death of a 
U.S. citizen or resident if any portion of a foreign trust was 
included in the gross estate of the decedent. In addition, a 
U.S. owner of any portion of a foreign trust is required to 
ensure that the trust files an annual return to provide full 
accounting of all the trust activities for the taxable year. 
Finally, any U.S. person that relieves (directly or indirectly) 
any distribution from a foreign trust is required to file a 
return to report the aggregate amount of the distributions 
received during the year.
      The Senate amendment provides that if a U.S. owner of any 
portion of a foreign trust fails to appoint a limited U.S. 
agent to accept service of process with respect to any requests 
and summons by the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with 
the tax treatment of any items related to the trust, the 
Secretary of the Treasury may determine the tax consequences of 
amounts to be taken into account under the grantor trust rules. 
In cases where adequate records are not provided to the 
Secretary of Treasury to determine the proper treatment of any 
distributions from a foreign trust, the distribution is 
includible in the gross income of the U.S. distributee and is 
treated as an accumulation distribution from the middle year of 
a foreign trust (i.e., computed by taking the number of years 
that the trust has been in existence divided by 2) for purposes 
of computing the interest charge applicable to such 
distribution, unless the foreign trust elects to have a U.S. 
agent for the limited purpose of accepting service of process 
(as described above).
      Under the Senate amendment, a person that fails to 
provide the required notice or return in cases involving the 
transfer of property to a new or existing foreign trust, or a 
distribution by a foreign trust to a U.S. person, is subject to 
an initial penalty equal to 35 percent of the gross reportable 
amount (generally the value of the property involved in the 
transaction). A failure to provide an annual reporting of trust 
activities will result in an initial penalty equal to 5 percent 
of the gross reportable amount. An additional $10,000 penalty 
is imposed for continued failure for each 30-day period (or 
fraction thereof) beginning 90 days after the Treasury 
Department notifies the responsible party of such failure. Such 
penalties are subject to a reasonable cause exception. In no 
event will the total amount of penalties exceed the gross 
reportable amount.
      Effective date.--The reporting requirements and 
applicable penalties generally apply to reportable events 
occurring or distributions received after the date of 
enactment. The annual reporting requirement and penalties 
applicable to U.S. grantors apply to taxable years of such 
persons beginning after the date of enactment.
            Reporting of foreign gifts
      The Senate amendment generally requires any U.S. person 
(other than certain tax-exempt organizations) that receives 
purported gifts or bequests from foreign sources totaling more 
than $10,000 during the taxable year to report them to the 
Treasury Department. The threshold for this reporting 
requirement is indexed for inflation. The definition of a gift 
to a U.S. person for this purpose excludes amounts that are 
qualified tuition or medical payments made on behalf of the 
U.S. person, as defined for gift tax purposes (sec. 
2503(e)(2)). If the U.S. person fails, without reasonable 
cause, to report foreign gifts as required, the Treasury 
Secretary is authorized to determine, in his sole discretion, 
the tax treatment of the unreported gifts. In addition, the 
U.S. person is subject to a penalty equal to 5 percent of the 
amount of the gift for each month that the failure continues, 
with the total penalty not to exceed 25 percent of such amount.
      Effective date.--The provision applies to amounts 
received after the date of enactment.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement does not include the Senate 
amendment.

    f. repeal of financial institution transition rule to interest 
                            allocation rules

Present law
      For foreign tax credit purposes, taxpayers generally are 
required to allocate and apportion interest expense between 
U.S. and foreign source income based on the proportion of the 
taxpayer's total assets in each location. Such allocation and 
apportionment is required to be made for affiliated groups (as 
defined in sec. 864(e)(5)) as a whole rather than on a 
subsidiary-by-subsidiary basis. However, certain types of 
financial institutions that are members of an affiliated group 
are treated as members of a separate affiliated group for 
purposes of allocating and apportioning their interest expense. 
Section 1215(c)(5) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514, 
100 Stat. 2548) includes a targeted rule which treats a certain 
corporation as a financial institution for this purpose.
House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      No provision. However, section 1606 of the Senate 
amendment to H.R. 3448 (Small Business Job Protection Act of 
1996) contained a provision that repeals section 1215(c)(5) of 
the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
      Effective date.--Taxable years beginning after December 
31, 1995.
Conference agreement
      The conference agreement includes the provision in the 
Senate amendment to H.R. 3448 with one modification. The 
conference agreement repeals section 1215(c)(5) of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1986 effective on the date of enactment. Under 
the conference agreement, a taxpayer will perform two 
computations with respect to its taxable year that includes the 
enactment date. Under the first computation, the taxpayer's 
pre-effective date interest expense is allocated and 
apportioned taking into account the targeted rule, and under 
the second computation, the taxpayer's post-effective date 
interest expense is allocated and apportioned without regard to 
the targeted rule. These computations will not require a 
closing of a taxpayer's books and records and it is intended 
that an administratively simple approach be used in applying 
this rule.
