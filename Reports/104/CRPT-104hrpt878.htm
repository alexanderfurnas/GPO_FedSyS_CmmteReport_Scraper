                            i. introduction

    In summarizing the Resources Committee's activities in the 
104th Congress, both at the Subcommittee and Full Committee 
level, we believe that the Committee has addressed a host of 
perennial issues in a fundamentally different way from the 
past. We have demonstrated this through legislative initiatives 
and pursuit of aggressive oversight.
    We have passed legislation on many matters which reflect 
the concerns of citizens from all walks of life--the people we 
were sent to Congress to represent. These initiatives included 
measures to streamline the management of the Department of 
Interior; reform of the Endangered Species Act; preservation of 
State control over coastal waters; improved management of the 
Nation's parks through increased self-funding mechanisms and 
management improvements; increase private property rights 
protection; mining law reforms; fisheries protection; improved 
management and protection of timber resources in the Pacific 
Northwest; and components of the Balanced Budget Act.
    Our record on oversight has been aggressive, yet balanced 
and fair. Our emphasis has been on finding ways to make 
government function better and more efficiently, focusing on 
agencies that need that type of attention, including the Bureau 
of Reclamation, the National Park Service, the Forest Service, 
the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land 
Management.
    Some legislation was held at Full Committee instead of 
being referred to the appropriate subcommittee for procedural 
reasons.
    This activities report reflects the hard work of the 
Members and staff of this Committee. It is a record we all can 
be proud of.

                            ii. jurisdiction

    (1) Measures and matters concerning the transportation of 
natural gas from or within Alaska and disposition of oil 
transported by the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
    (2) Measures and matters relating to Alaska public lands, 
including forestry and forest management issues, and Federal 
reserve water rights.
    (3) Environmental and habitat measures and matters of 
general applicability.
    (4) All measures and matters relating to Native Alaskans.
    (5) All measures and matters retained by the Full Committee 
under Committee Rule 15.

      IV. Oversight Activities of the Full Committee on Resources

A. Introduction

            Trans-Alaska Pipeline
     At the start of the 104th Congress, the Committee on 
Resources expanded its jurisdiction over the trans-Alaska 
pipeline. The Committee indicated that it would continue its 
vigilant oversight of the operation and safety of the pipeline. 
The Committee was particularly concerned that the repairs and 
maintenance upgrades agreed to by the operator of the pipeline, 
Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, as a result of Federal and 
internal audits be strictly adhered to. Regular briefings and 
consultation were required from Alyeska and the regulating 
agencies. In addition, Committee staff planned to perform field 
inspections of Alyeska equipment and facilities at least once a 
year to assess compliance. At the completion of repairs, the 
Committee indicated that a hearing might be held to close out 
this particular set of oversight concerns which were first 
raised by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of 
the Committee on Energy and Commerce in the 103d Congress.
    A Member field inspection of the pipeline was planned as a 
component of an Alaska issues field trip in mid-1995.
    During the course of the 104th Congress, virtually all of 
the goals stated above were achieved. There were numerous 
briefings in Washington and Anchorage by Federal and 
interagency entities. Specifically, the Joint Pipeline Office 
(JPO) (the Federal-State interagency regulatory entity 
overseeing the pipeline) met many times with staff regarding 
the status of repairs and responses to a variety of employee 
and outside group concerns. Staff also met many times with 
representatives of the companies that comprise Alyeska 
regarding the Committee's concerns. The General Accounting 
Office also briefed staff on the status of the repair work, and 
JPO's regulatory effectiveness.
    In addition, there was a Member field trip to Alaska in the 
Summer of 1995, in which Members had an opportunity to tour the 
Valdez Terminal and the Coast Guard facility, and to inspect 
oil spill response equipment to get a first hand report of the 
status of issues related to Alyeska's activities. There also 
was staff inspection trip in the Summer of 1996 to view the 
status of repairs at the terminal and along the pipeline.
    While a close out hearing has not been held because of the 
pending status of audit closure items, such a hearing is 
anticipated during the 105th Congress. In the meantime, the 
Committee intends to continue to exercise its oversight 
responsibilities through close consultations with the Joint 
Pipeline Office. The Committee will also continue to receive 
regular briefings from all interested parties.
            Alaska Public Lands
    In addition to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the full 
Committee retains jurisdiction over public lands in Alaska, 
including forestry and forest management issues.
    Congresses past have legislated that Alaska be home to 85 
percent of the nation's acreage in the National Wildlife Refuge 
system (75.3 million acres), 69 percent of the nation's acreage 
in the National Park System (54.7 million acres) and roughly 70 
percent of the nation's wilderness system. The sheer size of 
Federal land holdings in parks, forests and other lands have 
made Alaska a perennial concern of the Committee. The enormous 
mineral reserves, including petroleum, are also of interest to 
the Committee. At the start of the Congress it was decided that 
as the situation warranted, the Committee would consider 
holding one or more hearings on issues related to timber 
production and conservation in the Tongass National Forest and 
on potential petroleum production in the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge. Management of the national parks in Alaska was 
also recognized as another topic of interest.
    Given the large number of new Members, including freshmen, 
the Committee planned an oversight field trip to Alaska in mid-
1995 to acquaint members with a range of issues.
    Several members participated in field trip to Alaska in the 
Summer of 1995 which gave them an opportunity to see first hand 
the practical affects of the statistics mentioned above. The 
trip included a series of briefings and meetings with state, 
Federal, industry, and Alaska native officials. Also, Members 
visited Valdez to look at the site of the 1989 oil spill, 
surveyed several working mines and fisheries, visited the 
Tongass National Forest and inspected portions of the trans-
Alaska Pipeline.
    Specific concerns regarding fishing, wildlife, mining, oil 
exploration, timber, and Indian issues facing the state and the 
nation were addressed through a broad cross section of hearings 
discussed elsewhere in this activities report.
    Regarding the Committee's action on matters related to the 
Tongass National Forest, the Full Committee held five hearings 
on two bills. Hearings were held in Wrangell, Ketchikan, Thorne 
Bay, and Sitka, Alaska, on H.R. 2413, The Tongass Transfer and 
Transition Act. The bill proposed a legal mechanism for the 
State of Alaska to assume ownership of the Tongass National 
Forest and for the transition from Federal to state ownership. 
Most witnesses testifying supported the concept of State 
ownership of the Tongass, including elected officials, Native 
corporations, and other commercial interests. Many Alaskans 
base their support of Tongass transfer on the belief that 
Federal decision making with respect to the Tongass has moved 
further and further away from Alaska and closer to Washington, 
D.C. and, as a result, decisions are premised on popular, 
paternalistic notions of a surmised need to ``protect'' the 
``fragile'' Tongass from human activity.
    The fifth hearing was on H.R. 3659, the Environmental 
Improvement Timber Contract Extension Act. The bill proposed 
extending the only remaining long-term timber sale contract 
held by the Ketchikan Pulp Corporation (KPC) by fifteen years. 
The bill's premise was that an extended contract justified 
expenditure of approximately $200 million in environmental and 
energy efficiency improvements to the mill by the mill's owner. 
Without an extended contract, such an expenditure could not be 
amortized. However, the bill was not acted upon, in large part 
because of the Clinton Administration opposition. As a result, 
the owners of the KPC pulp mill announced that closure would 
occur in March 1997. Discussions are currently underway 
(December 1996) between the Clinton Administration and the 
company on providing a transitional timber supply sufficient to 
keep the KPC sawmill open for up to two years. Approximately 
500 people work at the KPC pulp mill and 500 work at the KPC 
sawmill.

                Task Force on the Endangered Species Act

                            i. introduction

    The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was last reauthorized in 
1988 for four years. Since that time, the listing of the 
northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest, the golden cheek 
warbler in Texas and a number of other species in various 
regions of the country have led to widespread concern over the 
implementation of the Act, including its effectiveness and 
impact on property owners and communities.
    The Task Force on Endangered Species of the Committee on 
Resources was created in February 1995 to review and study the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the operations and regulations 
of any Federal agency or entity having responsibility in or for 
administration of that Act, to determine whether the ESA is 
being implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent 
of Congress and whether it is desirable to enact new or 
additional legislation on the subject matter.
    The Task Force held seven field hearings and three hearings 
in Washington, D.C. (listed below.) (For further information 
see the ``Report of the Committee on Resources--Report on the 
Endangered Species Conservation and Management Act of 1995'' H. 
Rept. 104-778.)
     The Task Force identified a number of concerns to be 
addressed in legislation, based on the testimony received from 
the witnesses. The major areas of concern are:
          Reform the ESA to balance the methods by which 
        endangered or threatened species are protected while 
        protecting rights of private property owners and 
        workers, meeting public safety and health needs, and 
        achieving species conservation and recovery.
          Provide protection for private property rights and 
        provide incentives that would encourage private 
        landowners to protect species. Compensate private 
        property owners, through short- or long-term contracts, 
        when their property must be used by the public for 
        habitat for endangered or threatened species.
          Give the States a greater role in Federal decision 
        making processes and encourage more delegation of the 
        ESA to the States.
          Encourage voluntary measures that protect species.
          Streamline and simplify the process for obtaining 
        permits or for using the consultation process to obtain 
        approvals for activities in areas where species might 
        be present.
          Authorize general permits for routine activities with 
        minimal impacts.
          Require the Federal Government to share the costs of 
        expensive ESA-mandated mitigation measures.
          Limit the application of the ``take'' prohibition on 
        private property to only those actions that proximately 
        and foreseeably kill or physically injure an 
        identifiable member of an endangered species rather 
        than the broader prohibition on modification of 
        potential, as well as actual, habitat.
          Provide sufficient funds to pay for the programs 
        authorized in the ESA.
          Improve the credibility of the scientific 
        decisionmaking processes, particularly the listing 
        decision.
          Protect endangered species and subspecies but limit 
        the listing of ``distinct population segments'' to 
        those of national interest as determined by Congress.
          Clarify the distinction between regulations to 
        protect ``endangered species'' and those for 
        ``threatened species''.
          Give the Secretaries more flexibility after listing 
        to set achievable conservation objectives for the 
        species and develop conservation plans that consider 
        economic impacts, relying heavily on the advice and 
        assistance of a special assessment team.
          Make better use of Federal lands already in 
        conservation status through the establishment of the 
        National Biological Diversity Reserve System.
          Ensure that the ESA would not preempt other Federal 
        laws and is implemented consistently with other 
        important Federal missions.
          Discourage unnecessary and frivolous litigation and 
        ensure that all parties have equal access to judicial 
        review.

                         Task Force on Wetlands

                            i. introduction

    The Committee's jurisdiction over wildlife and fish extends 
to laws affecting the habitat of these biological resources. In 
recent years, the expansion of Federal protection of wetlands 
as biological habitat through the application of Section 404 of 
the Clean Water Act has had huge effects on land use in many 
parts of the country. The Task Force on Wetlands proposed to 
gather information for use in considering any Clean Water Act 
wetlands amendments which may be referred sequentially to the 
Committee on Resources and for further use in fashioning 
legislation pursuant to the Committee's primary jurisdiction in 
this area.
    The Task Force on Wetlands held three hearings in 
California, North Carolina and Louisiana. The Federal wetlands' 
regulatory program under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act has 
been implemented as a national land use planning tool and it is 
viewed by many interest groups as such. The Task Force hearings 
resulted in documentation of tens of examples of how the 
wetlands permitting program has been used to subvert private 
property rights, take property, and harass property owners. The 
cumbersome and often bureaucratic permitting process touches 
communities in every corner of the Nation--from Alaska (with 
170 million acres of wetlands) to Florida (with 11 million 
acres of wetlands). The task force heard testimony from 
farmers, ranchers, property owners, environmentalists, State 
officials, local officials and other interested groups.
    Testimony from witnesses justified several of the changes 
in law that were proposed in H.R. 1330, which was incorporated 
into the House-passed Clean Water Act Reform bill, H.R. 925. 
That bill proposed regulating wetlands based on their value 
classification. More valuable wetlands would be regulated more 
strictly and very low value, abundant wetlands would be 
regulated less strictly or not at all. The bill also 
streamlined the wetlands permitting program by requiring agency 
permit decisions within 90 days. Wetland delineation would be 
made on a site-specific basis and on ``clear evidence'' of 
wetland soil, vegetation and hydrology. Mitigation banking was 
also established under the House-passed bill, as were general 
permits for States, regions and classes of activities for the 
entire country. Private property rights were also addressed 
with a compensation provision, which contained a valuation 
threshold after which property owners must be compensated if 
the inability to receive a wetland permit devalued property.
    Members of the Task Force on Wetlands contributed to the 
refinement of legislative language based on task force hearing 
testimony.

                 Task Force on Private Property Rights

                            i. introduction

    In the 103d Congress, the Committee on Resources dealt with 
several related issues which arose under the issue of private 
property rights. These included the use of eminent domain by 
the Federal Government, regulatory takings as a Fifth Amendment 
issue, the right to privacy on private property, the 
application of State trespass laws to Federal agents, and the 
ongoing public policy debate over the proper balance between 
public benefits verses private costs. These issues continued to 
resurface in the 104th Congress not only as incidents to 
environmental legislation (including ESA and wetlands) but also 
in relation to management of Federal lands (including 
regulation of private inholdings and buffer areas) and Federal 
land use regimes protecting historic, cultural and other 
values. The Task Force on Private Property Rights proposed to 
gather testimonial evidence and to study these issues for the 
benefit of the Committee in dealing with legislation in this 
Congress.
    Private property is required for the capitalistic economic 
system envisioned by the founding fathers of the United States, 
who incorporated the principle of private property protection 
into the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The property 
clauses of the U.S. Constitution ensure that government does 
not unnecessarily interfere with or appropriate private 
property.
    However, several Federal laws and programs have slowly been 
interpreted by the courts and applied by the Federal Government 
so as to erode the ability of private property owners to use 
and enjoy their property. Two laws, the Endangered Species Act 
and the Clean Water Act (Section 404 wetland provisions), have 
been the basis for Federal regulators and agencies to place 
restrictions on the use of private property and even prohibit 
use of private property. Doing so is not ordinarily in the 
property owner's best economic interest and often does not 
improve environmental protection.
    As the Committee on Resources undertook review of laws 
within its jurisdiction in the 104th Congress, the Chairman 
formed the Task Force on Private Property rights to examine the 
balance of how issues of private property rights have shifted 
in application of laws within the Committee's jurisdiction. The 
Task Force was Chaired by Congressman John Shadegg and four 
hearings were held. The Task Force heard from 87 witnesses 
including Constitutional scholars, property owners subject to 
Federal laws and regulation, litigants and attorneys with 
pertinent property rights cases, environmental groups, elected 
officials, corporate representatives and association 
representatives.
    Task Force testimony established, for example, the 
following information in three volumes of Committee hearing 
records:
          Congress has a Constitutional basis to legislate 
        private property protection;
          Congress has a basis to advance current court 
        interpretations of the Fifth Amendment (i.e., provide 
        greater protection of private property rights);
          Property right infringements occur in wetlands 
        permitting under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act 
        when permits are withheld for mitigation of damage to 
        wetlands;
          Property right infringements occur in application of 
        the Endangered Species Act when the Federal agencies 
        demand that a portion of a property owner's land be 
        preserved for habitat;
          Private nuisance actions can adequately address 
        disputes between property owners and Federal 
        legislation need not address this issue;
          Federal legislation need not (and H.R. 925, the 
        House-passed Clean Water Act Reauthorization bill did 
        not) infringe on State and local authority to regulate 
        land use through zoning power;
          The judicial process to enforce property rights from 
        Federal Government infringement is time-consuming and 
        expensive;
          Property right infringements occur as a result of 
        other Federal actions such as the rails-to-trails 
        program and in designation of recreation and park 
        areas; and
          Property rights infringements occur when unreasonable 
        restrictions are placed on Federal permits (such as 
        grazing permits).

             Task Force on Salvage Timber and Forest Health

                            i. introduction

    The Timber Salvage and Forest Health Task Force was created 
to oversee and report on implementation of the timber 
provisions contained in Section 2001 of Public Law 104-13. This 
legislation was developed by House (and then Senate) 
authorizing committees in cooperation with the Committee on 
Appropriations and the prime sponsor, Representative Charles 
Taylor (R-NC).
    There were two timber provisions in Section 2001. The first 
provision was an expedited timber salvage program, which was 
designed to ensure dead and dying ``salvage'' trees could be 
expeditiously harvested while giving the Secretary of 
Agriculture complete and total discretion to apply substantive 
environmental laws (including forest standards and guidelines) 
in preparing and offering the salvage sales. Hard target levels 
were removed from the House version of the bill in conference. 
The second provision was called the Section 318 proviso. The 
Section 318 proviso provided sufficiency language to ensure 
harvesting of timber sales that were presumed in the biological 
analysis of the Northwest Forest Plan to be already harvested 
with no significant impact to the environment. Subsection (d) 
and subsection (k) of Section 2001 directed the release of 
those sales to fulfill the obligations of the President's 
Option 9 Northwest Forest Plan.
    The Task Force held six hearings, including one joint 
hearing with the Senate authorizing committee and three field 
hearings. Testimony from Forest Service officials, timber 
businesses, environmental groups, logging companies, State 
officials, local officials and other interest groups form the 
basis of the following observations from the hearing record:
          Salvage timber sales reduce fire risk and can be used 
        to clean up forests for restocking after fires;
          Salvage timber sales are helpful by improving the 
        health of forests;
          Salvage timber accumulated on Forest Service lands 
        after the 1994 fire season was 18 billion board feet, 
        6-9 billion board feet of which is commercially 
        harvestable;
          While the law provided ample latitude for foresters 
        to prepare and offer salvage timber sales, the 
        discretion was withheld by the Department of 
        Agriculture;
          Withholding discretion prevented the achievement of 
        the level of salvage timber harvesting contemplated by 
        the sponsors of the salvage timber law (6 billion board 
        feet) over the time period of the law's applicability;
          Withholding discretion may have also contributed to 
        the record fire season in 1996 (6 million acres 
        burned);
          Harvesting more timber salvage would have provided 
        needed timber supply for mills (particularly small 
        business mills) that rely on pubic land timber to 
        maintain their operation and employment levels;
          Because the law was not fully or properly utilized as 
        contemplated by the drafters, those relying on timber 
        for their careers, medical benefits and family income 
        became or remained unemployed due to lack of timber 
        supply;
          Because the law was improperly implemented, the 
        forest health conditions have not improved on public 
        lands;
          There was a high degree of frustration about 
        implementation of the law among those who rely on 
        timber for their livelihoods because the Administration 
        did not properly utilize its discretion to produce 
        salvage sales;
          Contrary to claims by some environmental groups, the 
        law did not result in ``logging without laws'' because 
        the discretion to apply all standards and guidelines 
        remained with the Secretary of Agriculture and he 
        explicitly did not waive substantive laws, standards 
        and guidelines for the salvage sales; and
          Contrary to claims by some environmental groups, 
        salvage sales were not old growth sales of healthy 
        trees (some groups confused sales authorized by the so-
        called Section 318 proviso of the timber provisions of 
        Section 2001 with salvage sales).

                  Task Force on Indian Fund Management

                            i. introduction

    The Task Force on Indian Trust Fund Management was created 
on May 21, 1996, to review and study the management and 
reconciliation of Indian trust fund accounts administered by 
the Department of the Interior. The Task Force held hearings in 
Washington, D.C., Alaska and Arizona on what was found to be 
one of this Nation's longest scandals. Billions of dollars of 
transactions conducted by Federal officials were found to be 
unreconcilable by Arthur Andersen LLP in a reconciliation study 
completed in 1995. A new task force may be created during the 
105th Congress to follow up on the work completed in 1996 and 
to recommend legislation which will effectively terminate the 
Administration's mismanagement of Indian trust fund accounts 
which continues to this day.

           Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Lands

                            i. introduction

    The 104th Congress proved to be historic for the 
Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Lands. Although the 
Subcommittee has a long tradition of an aggressive legislative 
agenda, the 104th Congress resulted in the passage of the 
Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, which is 
the largest and most important parks and public lands 
legislation in nearly 20 years. In a truly bipartisan fashion, 
H.R. 4236 includes measures that benefit Americans from coast 
to coast. Overall, the Subcommittee, under the direction of 
Chairman Jim Hansen, was referred 241 bills, held hearings on 
102 different bills, and enacted in some form over 80 different 
bills.
     The Omnibus Parks bill created several new national park 
units including the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in 
Kansas, to protect one of the last remaining unplowed stretches 
of tallgrass prairie; the Nicodemus National Historic Site, to 
protect a historic community established for freed slaves; the 
New Bedford National Historic Park, to honor the Nation's 
whaling industry; Boston Harbor Islands, to protect unique 
islands in Boston Harbor; and the Washita National Battlefield, 
to preserve a Plains Indians battlefield. Moreover, the 
Subcommittee included a unique provision to preserve the 
Presidio of California that involves the National Park Service 
and the newly created Presidio Trust that will allow private 
non-profit management of the extensive resources of the 
Presidio. The Omnibus bill also provides for the protection of 
the Sterling Forest for the States of New Jersey and New York 
through matching funds and State management. Much of the 
success of the Subcommittee can be measured in terms of finding 
new and better ways to manage our resources and the Presidio 
and Sterling Forest initiatives are prime examples.
    Historic preservation and the establishment of new 
memorials were important parts of the Omnibus Parks bill. 
Included are provisions to further protect the Manzanar 
National Historic Site, Independence Hall, establishing a 
historic trail to commemorate the Selma to Montgomery civil 
rights march and reauthorization of the Advisory Council on 
Historic Preservation. Memorials were established for the 
memory of Martin Luther King, Jr., Black Revolutionary War 
Patriots and Japanese-American Patriots. Initiatives were also 
included to preserve important battlefields from Independence 
at Yorktown to Civil War sites in Virginia, Mississippi, 
Louisiana and Georgia. Eight new National Heritage Areas were 
established that will allow for the preservation of the customs 
and culture of areas through unique Federal and local 
management.
    Other provisions of the Omnibus bill involve several land 
exchanges, including the Snowbasin exchange that will 
facilitate the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Utah. The Sand 
Hollow land exchange near Zion National Park will allow a 
historic water agreement between the State of Utah and the 
Department of the Interior to ensure protection of Zion Park. 
National Park Service administrative reform was included to 
improve the management of the service, improve housing for Park 
employee, eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements and 
require Senate confirmation of the Park Service Director.
    Overall, the 104th Congress will prove to be a landmark in 
environmental responsibility. The Subcommittee recognizes 
current budget and resource constraints and is finding new and 
better ways to preserve our environment, our history and our 
resources.

iv. oversight activities of the subcommittee on national parks, forests 
                               and lands

A. Introduction

    While enacting many initiatives during the 104th Congress, 
the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Lands 
aggressively fulfilled its oversight mandate by conducting 23 
oversight hearings on a wide variety of issues. The 
Subcommittee focused its oversight on waste, fraud and abuse 
within the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management 
and the Forest Service. The Subcommittee also sought out 
solutions to the problems identified in the course of the 
oversight hearings and acted on those solutions. In its on-
going efforts to provide for better management of our Nation's 
Federal lands, the Subcommittee probed the mismanagement of 
funds, regulations that are overburdensome and outdated, access 
to the public, health of our resources and alternative 
management policies.
    The National Park Service and the resources it manages were 
a major focus of the Subcommittee's oversight activities. In 
its proposed oversight plan, the Subcommittee proposed nine 
oversight hearings to shed light on the problems facing the 
National Park System. Seven of the proposed oversight hearings 
were conducted by the Subcommittee. These hearings looked into 
the financial mismanagement crisis facing the National Park 
Service, the Park Service's re-organization plan, historic 
preservation, subsidies to visitors, concessions reform, and 
public access and use of National Parks. These oversight 
activities resulted in significant Park Service reforms and 
important progress on many other issues. These activities were 
assisted by three completed General Accounting Office (GAO) 
reports and the initiation of four other on-going reports.
    Recognizing the many problems and issues facing America's 
National Forests and their management, the Subcommittee on 
National Parks, Forests and Lands conducted ten oversight 
hearings in a systematic approach to identify and isolate the 
many complex issues facing the U.S. Forest Service. At a time 
when forest health in the West is in a crisis, the Subcommittee 
identified many problems such as salvage timber, fuel loads, 
impacts of species recovery, the Forest Service planning 
process, the Forest Service decision making process, eco-region 
based decision making, implementation of the President's forest 
plan, fire management and control, and the appeals process. 
Correction of all these issues is critical to a sustainable 
forest system for the future. Millions of acres of National 
Forest were lost to a record fire season in 1996 and the 
Subcommittee identified many of the issues that lead to this 
level of destruction of the Nation's resources. Although the 
Subcommittee proposed only seven oversight hearings, the ten 
that were conducted establish the basis for Forest Service 
reform that the Subcommittee will pursue in the upcoming 
Congress.
    The Subcommittee completed three of the four proposed 
oversight hearings in carrying out its oversight 
responsibilities of the Bureau of Land Management. These 
oversight hearings investigated the Federal land exchange 
process, RS 2477 right-of-way regulations and Federal versus 
State management of public lands. These hearings identified 
overly burdensome and unworkable regulations that have severe 
impacts on those who live in the rural West. The Subcommittee 
found that the land exchange process is currently unworkable 
and makes land exchanges too expensive, too slow and too 
expensive. This resulted in Chairman Hansen proposing 
legislation to streamline the process and to make it more 
accessible to small land owners. Likewise, the oversight into 
RS 2477 rights-of-way found the proposed regulations by the 
Administration would financially cripple many local governments 
and would result in closing thousands of miles of roads 
necessary for access across Federal lands.
            National Park Service (NPS)
    Status of the National Parks: The Subcommittee proposed to 
hold a joint oversight hearing with the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee that would focus on a General 
Accounting Office (GAO) report which states that the NPS 
managers cannot provide any assurance that they are meeting the 
dual agency mandates of protecting park resources or serving 
park visitors. The Subcommittee held this hearing on March 7, 
1995.
    Budget Crisis Facing Our National Parks: Instead of a 
hearing on the Clinton Budget proposal, the Subcommittee 
proposed to hold a hearing on the broader topic of the NPS 
budget shortfall and funding accountability. The main witnesses 
were the GAO and the Interior Inspector General who were asked 
to summarize many reports of recent years. The Subcommittee 
explored these issues in a hearing held on February 9, 1995.
    Reinventing the National Park Service: The NPS has a 
proposal for a massive and costly reorganization plan. The 
Subcommittee proposed to hold a joint hearing with the Interior 
Appropriations Subcommittee, providing a chance to work 
together with that Subcommittee while answering questions of 
concern to both Subcommittees. These issues were taken up 
during the oversight hearing held on February 9, 1995.
    Heritage Areas: National Heritage Areas are an increasingly 
popular designation for which no NPS policy or organic act 
exists. The Subcommittee will consider legislation that will 
establish the Park Service's role in these areas. An 
investigation of one of the existing areas will help the 
Members understand how these areas operate and to what extent 
the Federal Government should be involved. The Subcommittee 
held a hearing on proposed generic legislation on March 22, 
1995.
    Presidio Management: Management of the Presidio Army base 
has passed to the NPS due to the Military Base Closure process. 
Much debate has occurred over NPS management of what is 
essentially a small city. The Subcommittee proposed to fully 
investigate the true leasing potential of the facilities at the 
Presidio, the cost to the NPS during and after any transition 
period, and what areas of the Presidio belong in the park 
system. The Subcommittee completed its oversight on this issue 
in the hearing held on May 16, 1995.
    Natural Resource Management and Wildlife Management Within 
the Park System: A number of scientists have questioned the NPS 
policy of natural regulation, especially with regard to 
management of large mammals and fire. Some have even gone so 
far as to question whether the NPS is in violation of the 
Endangered Species Act in Yellowstone National Park where elk 
have been allowed to far exceed the carrying capacity of the 
range and have impacted several rare plant species. A hearing 
was proposed to highlight the need for more enlightened and 
activist resource management policies in our parks. Due to time 
constraints this hearing was postponed until early in the 105th 
Congress.
    Oversight of Trail Usage and Programs: Congressman Bruce 
Vento (D-MN) and Congressman Nick Jo Rahall, Jr., (D-WV) had 
previously planned to hold this hearing and a group of 
interested persons from the trail community held several public 
meetings around the country to solicit public comment. They 
planned to complete a report of their findings this spring. An 
oversight hearing on this issue was proposed on what is 
probably the most popular outdoor recreation activity. It is 
important to define precisely what the role of the Federal 
Government should be. This hearing is now planned for the 105th 
Congress.
    Concessions Reform: The Subcommittee proposed to explore 
ways to reform concessions policy without negatively impacting 
visitor services at our parks. The Department of the Interior 
acknowledges these problems and is seeking a way to reform the 
system that will benefit competition and retain excellent 
visitor services. The Subcommittee proposed to investigate 
several different types of concessionaires and the quality of 
service they provide and what impact, if any, they are having 
on park resources. Concessions reform was explored during 
hearings held on July 25, 1995, and on July 18, 1996.
    Historic Preservation: There are an increasing number of 
issues surrounding historic preservation, especially with 
regard to protection of private property. Additionally, there 
has been criticism that the entire system is bureaucracy laden 
and needs serious reform to ensure that more dollars are spent 
on bricks and mortar as opposed to paying administrative 
overhead expenses. How is the Federal side interacting with the 
State side? Is there duplication of bureaucracy? Should the 
Federal role be limited? The Subcommittee intended to pursue 
these issues through an oversight hearing assessing the entire 
system. This oversight hearing was held on March 20, 1996.
            Forest Service
    Emergency Salvage Sales: The Subcommittee proposed to 
conduct an oversight hearing on forest health and the need for 
emergency salvage sales. During last year's fire season this 
nation lost millions of board feet of harvestable timber to 
fires due to alleged mismanagement of our national forests. In 
addition to the loss of timber, the Subcommittee is concerned 
about unnecessary loss of life and property. A hearing was held 
on February 10, 1995.
    Appeals Reform: The Subcommittee proposed to investigate 
and hear testimony on the effectiveness, fairness, and 
efficiency of the current appeals process on Forest Service 
actions. Issues that were investigated included: Is there a 
level playing field in this process and are legitimate Forest 
Service actions being thwarted through regulations that are not 
achieving the just results intended from an appeals process? 
How can the current process be streamlined, and reformed to 
result in a fairer and more effective process? The Subcommittee 
held a hearing on this issue on June 20, 1996.
    Administration Reform: The Forest Service is currently 
going through administrative reform. The Subcommittee proposed 
to hold an oversight hearing on this reform, looking at the 
impacts this reform will have on the Agency. Agency efficiency, 
accountability for funds and products, outcomes, savings and 
cost effectiveness will be the primary focus of this effort. A 
hearing was postponed until the 105th Congress.
    Below Cost Timber Sales: Over the past years the timber 
industry has been accused of receiving subsidies due to ``below 
cost'' timber sales on Federal lands. In fact, in 1993 the 
Forest Service published a list of forests where all timber 
sales will be terminated due to an allegation of below cost 
sales. Others have alleged that the assumptions behind ``below 
cost'' sales are fallacious due to many factors, including cost 
accounting, Forest Service policies and other reasons. The 
Subcommittee proposed to investigate these issues to fairly 
determine whether Federal timber programs are subsidized. This 
issues was explored during a hearing held on June 20, 1995.
    Forest Service Planning Process: An oversight hearing was 
proposed to assess the workability of the forest planning 
process and the Agency's plans for regulatory change. The 
hearing will identify changes needed, and assess the Agency's 
compliance with current authorities. Planning is governed by 
the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) and is impacted by 
the National Environmental Policy Act. Issues proposed to be 
explored included: What does the Agency identify as major 
problems with the present planning statutes and regulations? 
What impact are those problems having on the ground and on the 
timber industry? The Subcommittee held a series of oversight 
hearings on this complex issue on February 29, 1996, March 26, 
1996 and May 21, 1996.
    Northwest Forest Plan: The Administration has implemented 
the Northwest timber plan known as Option 9. The Subcommittee 
proposed to examine the successes and failures of the plan thus 
far. What have the impacts been on these communities and what 
changes need to be made to make the program successful or does 
Option 9 need to be terminated? A hearing was held on July 23, 
1996.
    Commodity Output Goals: The Forest Service is directed to 
set and achieve commodity output goals under the Organic Act, 
the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act, and the NFMA. The 
Subcommittee proposed to assess the Agency's performance in 
setting these goals and the failure of the Agency to achieve 
those output goals. Issues include what are the reasons behind 
these failures and what type of policy initiatives should be 
pursued to cure these failures? These issues were addressed in 
a hearing held on November 30, 1995.
            Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
    RS 2477 Proposed Regulations: The Subcommittee proposed to 
hold an oversight hearing on the current proposed RS 2477 
regulations that greatly impact right-of-ways across Federal 
lands. This is primarily a BLM issue and the proposed 
regulations promise to close thousands of roads across the 
West. The hearing focused on the history of RS 2477 right-of-
ways, legal rights of State and local governments, the 
financial and administrative burden placed on these governments 
to comply with the regulations and the impacts these 
regulations will have on the surrounding communities. The 
Subcommittee held a hearing on March, 16, 1995.
    Federal versus State Management of Public Lands: The BLM 
has been accused of subsidizing grazing, timber and other 
commodity uses on public lands. There is an increasing interest 
in turning these management responsibilities over to the States 
where they so desire. Advocates say this will lift the burden 
off the Federal Government and give the States more control 
over the lands within their borders. There is increasing 
opinion that the States manage their public lands more 
efficiently and are producing resources in better condition 
than those managed by the BLM. The Subcommittee proposed to 
analyze the possibilities of State management of these lands 
and the fiscal impacts on both the Federal and State 
Governments. This issue was heard during a June 20, 1995, 
hearing.
    BLM Land Exchange Process: Currently the BLM 
administratively exchanges Federal BLM lands identified for 
disposal for State or private lands identified for acquisition 
by the BLM. This process provides a way for the BLM to meet its 
mission and allows inholders and other private interests to 
resolve Federal ownership problems. An exchange under perfect 
conditions takes approximately two years to complete at 
enormous cost. Thus, only large and/or wealthy inholders are 
able to take advantage of this process. The Subcommittee 
proposed to hold an oversight hearing on the program and look 
into ways the program can be streamlined and opened up to small 
landowners. A hearing was held on May 9, 1995.
    BLM Management of Wild Horses and Burros: Under the Wild 
and Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act, these animals are 
protected and managed by the BLM. These species create serious 
resource management problems. The BLM has spent millions of 
dollars attempting to manage these animals through adoption 
programs, sterilization experiments and other methods. The 
Subcommittee proposed to look at the success and failures of 
this program and look into the needs and shortfalls of the 
program. This hearing is now planned for the 105th Congress.
            Miscellaneous Issues
    Wilderness Criteria and Wilderness Management: The 
Subcommittee proposed to explore the implementation of the 1964 
Wilderness Act, including wilderness area under the 1964 
Wilderness Act. This issue became very controversial during 
debate of the California Desert Protection Act in the 103d 
Congress: specifically, what does ``roadless'' mean? The 
Subcommittee proposed to look at examples of areas designated 
as wilderness to determine if they comply with the 1964 Act and 
will explore amendments to the Act to resolve future issues. 
This issue will be explored during the 105th Congress.
    Recreational User Fees on Federal Lands: Recreational use 
of Federal lands receives an annual subsidy of $1.2 billion. 
The Subcommittee planned to conduct an oversight hearing on the 
recreational use of all Federal lands to determine how these 
uses can become more self-sufficient. This hearing was held on 
May 11, 1995.
    Single Land Use Agency: Currently, management of Federal 
lands is conducted by four different agencies: Forest Service, 
National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and the Fish 
and Wildlife Service. These agencies have very similar missions 
and their activities often overlap and are only separated by 
political boundaries that do not make management sense. The 
Subcommittee proposed to look into the feasibility of combining 
these functions into a single land management agency. This 
inquiry will discuss possible efficiencies, united policy 
directions, cost savings and other management advantages. The 
Subcommittee did not hold a hearing on this issue.
    Wild and Scenic River Act Study Designations: Currently, 
once a river is designated for study under the Act, it stays in 
this status until the study is completed, and then up to three 
additional years. The Subcommittee proposed to look at the 
effects this has had on river management and the effects on 
private interests on and around these study rivers. The 
Subcommittee will hold this hearing during the 105th Congress.
    Ecosystem Management: Ecosystem management is the new buzz 
word in Federal lands management. While numerous agencies claim 
to be practicing it, no one is quite sure exactly what it is. 
The Administration has several pilot projects, one of the most 
visible is South Florida where the cost to implement ecosystem 
management is estimated to be $1-4 billion. An oversight 
hearing was proposed to examine this program as well as some of 
the underlying scientific assumptions. This issue was explored 
during a hearing held on May 21, 1996.

             Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans

                            i. introduction

    Embodying the majority of the jurisdiction of the former 
Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries (abolished at the 
beginning of the 104th Congress), the Subcommittee on 
Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans brought a new set of 
complimentary issues to the Members of the Resources Committee.
    Drawing on its bi-coastal membership, the Subcommittee, 
under the leadership of Chairman Jim Saxton of Mt. Holly, New 
Jersey, explored topics ranging from the bottom of the ocean to 
the top of the world in the Arctic.
    During the first Republican-controlled Congress in over 40 
years, Chairman Saxton promoted the goal of reducing the size 
of the Federal Government by transferring title to seven 
Federal fish hatcheries to State and local control; Federal 
ocean programs were streamlined to increase effectiveness, 
reduce bureaucratic costs, and improve Federal-State 
coordination; realistic funding levels were implemented for the 
Coastal Zone Management Program, the National Marine 
Sanctuaries Program, the National Sea Grant College Program, 
and other environmental laws to reflect budget constraints; 
user fees were established to recover costs from a small group 
of farmers who have requested fisheries certification from the 
Federal Government; private property rights were recognized in 
Federal land use decisions; a balance was created between the 
need to protect fish and wildlife populations and compatible 
multiple uses of public lands; the wise expenditure of 
taxpayers money was ensured by demanding greater accountability 
of Federal programs through increased oversight; free trade in 
fisheries and wildlife areas was promoted; and cutting-edge 
technology and its application in frontier regions was 
examined.
    The Subcommittee also had an extremely successful 
legislative agenda during its debut Congress. Major bills 
originating in the Subcommittee include:
Fisheries Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-43)
    This comprehensive conservation measure provides effective 
solutions to properly manage and protect international fishery 
stocks. It requires the issuance of fishing permits to U.S. 
vessels on the high seas; reauthorizes the Fishermen's 
Protective Act; protects pollock stocks in the Sea of Okhotsk; 
encourages the global ban on driftnets; extends U.S. 
participation in International Convention for the Conservation 
of Atlantic Tunas; and implements U.S.-Canada salmon agreement.
Coastal Zone Protection Act (Public Law 104-150)
    This legislation extends the landmark Coastal Zone 
Management Act of 1972, which encourages States to regulate 
land and water uses that affect their coastal environment. 
Twenty-nine of the 35 eligible coastal States and territories 
have Federally approved coastal zone management plans. These 
plans provide essential protection to 95,000 miles of coastline 
or almost 95 percent of our Nation's total.
National Marine Sanctuaries Preservation Act (Public Law 104-238)
    This measure reauthorizes the National Marine Sanctuaries 
Act of 1972. The primary objective of this vital environmental 
law is to protect marine resources, such as coral reefs, sunken 
historical vessels, or unique habitats, while facilitating all 
``compatible'' uses of those resources.
Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-297)
    The fundamental goal of this Act is to improve the 
conservation and management of Federal fishery resources within 
the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. This legislation reauthorizes 
the historic Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act 
and it addresses a number of problems identified by the eight 
Regional Fishery Management Councils.
National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act of 1996
    This legislation amends the National Wildlife Refuge 
Administration Act of 1966 to improve the management of our 
Nation's National Wildlife Refuge System. This System needs to 
have a statutory list of purposes, uniform guidelines to 
determine what activities are permissible, comprehensive 
conservation plans, and the enthusiastic support of the 
American people.

                            ii. jurisdiction

    (1) Fisheries management and fisheries research generally, 
including the management of all commercial and recreational 
fisheries, the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act, interjurisdictional fisheries, international fisheries 
agreements, aquaculture, seafood safety, and fisheries 
promotion.
    (2) Wildlife resources, including research, restoration, 
refuges and conservation.
    (3) All matters pertaining to the protection of coastal and 
marine environments, including estuarine protection.
    (4) Coastal barriers.
    (5) Oceanography.
    (6) Ocean engineering, including materials, technology, and 
systems.
    (7) Coastal zone management.
    (8) Marine sanctuaries.
    (9) U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
    (10) Sea Grant programs and marine extension services.

authority over activities, policies and programs within the 
jurisdiction of the Subcommittee.

IV. Oversight Activities of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and 
                                 Oceans

A. Introduction

            Budget Review
    The Subcommittee proposed to hold an oversight hearing to 
evaluate the President's Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 budget 
recommendations for the National Marine Fisheries Service and 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In addition, the 
Subcommittee proposed to review selected programs administered 
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
    On February 16, 1995, the Subcommittee conducted a budget 
oversight hearing. Testimony was obtained from Dr. D. James 
Baker, Department of Commerce, Mr. George T. Frampton, 
Department of the Interior, and Ms. Mollie Beattie, Director, 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
    During the Winter of 1996 the Subcommittee proposed to hold 
an oversight hearing on the President's fiscal year 1997 budget 
recommendations for the National Marine Fisheries Service, the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the ``wet'' NOAA programs.
    On March 27, 1996, the Subcommittee conducted an oversight 
hearing on the Administration's fiscal year 1997 budget 
recommendations. Testimony was obtained from a number of 
individuals including: Dr. D. James Baker, Department of 
Commerce, Dr. Robert W. Correll, National Science Foundation, 
and Dr. Andrew Solow, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.
            National Marine Fisheries Services
    Oversight Hearing on Various Fish Statutes: On Wednesday, 
January 25, 1995, the Subcommittee held the first of a series 
of oversight hearings on our Nation's major fish, wildlife and 
oceanography laws. At that time, testimony was received on the 
following statutes:
    (1) Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967. Authorization for 
the Fishermen's Guaranty Fund expired on September 30, 1993. 
This Fund, which is voluntary and self-financed, compensates 
U.S. fishermen for the seizure of their boats and catch by a 
foreign country. Last year, 258 U.S. fishermen were forced to 
pay $1,100 each to the Canadian Government for sailing through 
the Inside Passage. These ``transit fees'' were illegal and the 
Fishermen's Protective Act was amended by Public Law 104-43 to 
allow these Americans to be compensated for their financial 
loss.
    (2) Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975. This statute 
authorizes the United States participation in the International 
Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. Its 
authorization of appropriations expired September 30, 1993, but 
was extended by Public Law 104-43.
    (3) The Central Bering Sea Fisheries Enforcement Act. This 
measure prohibited U.S. fishermen from fishing in an area of 
international waters off the coast of Russia known as the Donut 
Hole. Legislation was enacted (Public Law 104-43) to extend 
this prohibition to another area known as the Peanut Hole.
    On November 3, 1995, the President signed H.R. 716, the 
Fisheries Act of 1995, into law. Incorporated within this 
measure was a reauthorization of the Fishermen's Protective Act 
of 1967 and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act of 1975. In 
addition, the Act implemented the Central Bering Sea Fisheries 
Enforcement Act, which will protect valuable pollack fishery 
stocks in the Sea of Okhotsk.
    Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act: This Act 
provides a national program for the conservation and management 
of the Nation's marine fishery resources within our 200-mile 
Exclusive Economic Zone. The Act established eight Regional 
Fishery Management Councils that have primary responsibility 
for managing the fishery resources outside of State waters. The 
authorization for this Act expired on September 30, 1993. On 
October 11, 1996, the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 became 
law (Public Law 104-297). This legislation reauthorizes and 
reforms the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. 
The fundamental purpose of this law is to conserve and manage 
the Federal fishery resources within the U.S. Exclusive 
Economic Zone.
            Fish and Wildlife Service
    Wildlife Management on Military Lands: The Sikes Act 
governs the management of wildlife on Department of Defense 
lands. The law's authorization for appropriations expired on 
September 30, 1993. During the 104th Congress, the House 
approved by voice vote H.R. 1141, the Sikes Act Improvement 
Amendments, on July 11, 1995. In addition, the provisions of 
this bill were incorporated within the House's version of the 
National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 323). Unfortunately, 
this provision was removed from the bill in Conference.
    National Wildlife Refuge System: The Subcommittee has 
jurisdiction over more than 91 million acres of Federal lands 
within the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Subcommittee 
conducted several oversight hearings on our Nation's National 
Wildlife Refuge System (H.R. 1675). It also took a leadership 
role in moving the National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act. 
This landmark legislation was approved by the House of 
Representatives on April 24, 1996. The Senate took no action on 
this proposal.
    National Fish and Wildlife Foundation: The National Fish 
and Wildlife Foundation assists in implementation of the North 
American Waterfowl Management Plan and provides matching funds 
for conservation activities nationwide. The law establishing 
the Foundation expires on September 30, 1998. On May 16, 1996, 
the Subcommittee conducted an oversight hearing on the National 
Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Testimony was heard from the 
Honorable Helen Chenoweth (R-ID), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, and public witnesses.
            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
    Anadromous Fish Conservation Act: This Act has been 
primarily a Federal grant program to the States to assist them 
in the management and conservation of various anadromous 
species, which are fish that migrate up rivers from the sea to 
reproduce in fresh water. Since in recent years there have been 
separate initiatives for several high-profile anadromous 
species, such as salmon, steelhead, and Atlantic striped bass, 
the Subcommittee examined the ongoing need for this program and 
whether its authorization of appropriations should be extended 
beyond September 30, 1995. The Anadromous Fish Conservation Act 
of 1965 was reauthorized until September 30, 2000, by Public 
Law 104-297 (Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996).
    Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act: This Act provides 
Federal support for the enforcement of the Atlantic States 
Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) striped bass management 
program to conserve this species. Individual States are 
required to implement management measures for their own waters 
consistent with the ASMFC Interstate Management Plan for 
striped bass. The authorization of appropriations for this Act 
expired on September 30, 1993. The House of Representatives on 
two separate occasions (H.R. 1139 and H.R. 4139) approved 
legislation to extend this important conservation measure, 
which has been largely responsible for the recovery of the 
Atlantic striped bass. Sadly, the Senate took no action on 
either measure.
    National Sea Grant College Program: This is a program that 
serves the marine science and business community. There are 29 
university-based State Sea Grant College programs which fund 
marine resource based research and provide marine advisory 
service. The program also provides a limited number of 
fellowships in marine affairs. Authorization of appropriations 
for the program expired on September 30, 1995. The Subcommittee 
conducted an oversight hearing on the National Sea Grant 
College Program and approved a three-year reauthorization 
measure. The House of Representatives took no action on H.R. 
1175, the Marine Resources Revitalization Act.
    Interjurisdictional Fisheries: The Interjurisdictional 
Fisheries Act of 1986 is designed to provide management of 
interjurisdictional fishery resources throughout their range, 
as well as encourage State participation in management. The Act 
expired on September 30, 1995. Authorization of appropriations 
for three years for the Act was incorporated within Public Law 
104-297, the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996.
    Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA): Last authorized in 
1990, this program encourages States to develop land use and 
near shore management programs based on State and local laws to 
better utilize and protect coastal resources. A State may veto 
certain Federally-permitted activities if that activity is not 
consistent with the State's program. Authorization for 
appropriations expired on September 30, 1995. On May 21, 1996, 
the President signed H.R. 1965, the Coastal Zone Protection 
Act, into law (Public Law 104-150). This legislation 
reauthorized funding for the Coastal Zone Management Act 
program development, administrative, resource management, 
enhancement, technical assistance, and estuarine grants until 
September 30, 1999.
    NOAA Corps: NOAA has under its jurisdiction a 405-person 
uniformed corps that is trained in both science and vessel 
operations. The Corps, which operates 18 active vessels and10 
aircraft, receives military type pay and benefits. On June 15, 
1995, the Subcommittee conducted an oversight hearing on the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ocean and 
coastal programs. Testimony was received on a wide range of 
NOAA programs, including its uniformed corps. The Corps was 
proposed for phase-out and elimination in H.R. 1756, a bill to 
abolish the Department of Commerce.
    NOAA's Generic Laws: The Subcommittee proposed to hold 
hearings on those NOAA programs and responsibilities under the 
jurisdiction of the Committee on Resources. On June 15, 1995, 
the Subcommittee conducted an oversight hearing on the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ocean and coastal 
programs. Testimony was received on a wide range of NOAA 
programs.
    Seafood Safety and Inspection Programs: Legislation to 
develop an expanded, mandatory national seafood safety program 
has been introduced and debated at length in previous 
Congresses. There is an ongoing debate over who should be the 
lead agency for seafood safety, the Food and Drug 
Administration, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, or the Agriculture Department. The Subcommittee 
proposed to hold an oversight hearing on this subject in Winter 
1996, but took no action on this issue.
    Fish Passages Technologies: Last Congress, the Committee on 
Merchant Marine and Fisheries requested that the Office of 
Technology Assessment prepare a report on the state of 
technology of fish passages and other systems for transferring 
hatchlings around Federal power projects. The Subcommittee 
proposed to have a hearing to assess this report in Winter 
1996. The Subcommittee took no action on this issue.
    Aquaculture: Each year, Federal funds are appropriated to 
the National Marine Fisheries Service to promote the growth of 
the marine aquaculture industry. The Subcommittee proposed to 
hold an oversight hearing to evaluate the effectiveness of this 
program and whether continued investment by the Federal 
Government is warranted, but it took no action on this issue.
    Dolphin/Tuna Issue: The Subcommittee has received 
information that several of our trading partners are being 
harmed by the embargo on any tuna caught using certain methods 
of capture involving dolphins. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna 
Commission has recommended tuna capture methods that include 
dolphins, but which have reduced dolphin deaths to extremely 
low levels. Several foreign governments have requested that the 
U.S. take another look at our embargo due to these new 
techniques. The Subcommittee proposed to hold an oversight 
hearing in Spring 1996. During the 104th Congress, the 
Subcommittee conducted an oversight hearing on this issue and a 
legislative hearing on H.R. 2823, the International Dolphin 
Conservation Program Act. On July 31, 1996, the House of 
Representatives approved this legislation, which implements the 
international agreement known as the ``Panama Declaration''.
    Pacific Salmon Treaty: The United States and Canada signed 
the Pacific Salmon Treaty in 1985. Since then, the two 
countries have met numerous times to further negotiate 
outstanding issues related to the Treaty. The U.S. is currently 
preparing an offer to resolve several critical issues. The 
Subcommittee proposed to hold an oversight hearing on these 
negotiations in Spring or Summer 1996. The Subcommittee did not 
hold an oversight hearing on this issue, however, language was 
incorporated into Public Law 104-293, the Sustainable Fisheries 
Act, implementing a U.S.-Canada agreement on joint salmon 
stocks.
    NOAA Fleet Modernization: As part of the 1992 NOAA 
Authorization Act, Congress required NOAA to prepare a fleet 
modernization plan for the Agency's aging research vessel fleet 
and to submit the plan to Congress. While NOAA has submitted 
the plan, fundamental questions remain whether these vessels 
should be replaced, the value of the data obtained and if these 
functions could be contracted out to private sector vessels. On 
June 15, 1995, the Subcommittee conducted an oversight hearing 
on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's ocean 
and coastal programs. Testimony was received on a wide range of 
NOAA programs, including its fleet program.
    National Marine Sanctuaries Program: Operated by NOAA, the 
National Marine Sanctuaries Program is comprised of 13 
underwater preserves, stretching from Stellwagen Banks offshore 
Massachusetts, to the Florida Keys, to a Hawaiian Humpback 
Whale Sanctuary. The authorization of appropriations for this 
Act expired on September 30, 1996. The Subcommittee proposed to 
hold one or more hearings on NOAA's efforts to manage the 
existing sanctuaries on a very limited budget; the status of 
the newly designated sanctuaries; and NOAA's ability to solve 
problems in resource management, including pollution threats, 
salvage operations, conflicts with fishing and recreational 
interests. The hearing was held on March 21, 1996. On October 
11, 1996, the President signed H.R. 543, the National Marine 
Sanctuaries Preservation Act, into law. The fundamental purpose 
of the National Marine Sanctuaries Program is to protect marine 
resources, such as coral reefs, sunken historical vessels, or 
unique habitats, while facilitating the ``compatible'' uses of 
those resources. The Act extended the authorization until 
September 30, 1999.
    Artificial Reefs: In recent years, there have been several 
proposals to allow National Defense Reserve Fleet surplus ships 
to be sold for scrap or used for artificial reefs. The 
Subcommittee proposed to hold an oversight hearing on the 
effectiveness of artificial reefs in building new fish and 
shellfish habitats, but the Subcommittee took no action on this 
issue.
    Saltonstall-Kennedy Program: The Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant 
Program is administered by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service and is used to provide grants for fisheries research 
and development projects. Funding is provided by the Department 
of Agriculture as a percentage of the gross receipts collected 
on imported fish and fish products. All grant projects undergo 
technical and industry review and are encouraged to have a 
cost-sharing component. The Subcommittee proposed to review the 
amounts received and granted under this program. The 
Subcommittee took no action on this issue.
            Miscellaneous and Joint Agency Issues
    Coastal Barrier Resource System: This Act was approved to 
reduce Federal expenditures in flood-prone coastal areas and to 
provide some environmental protection for certain coastal 
barriers. Inclusion in the system results in a prohibition on 
Federal funds for flood insurance, water and sewer grants, and 
highway construction. The authorization of appropriations for 
the program is set to expire on September 30, 1998. The 
Subcommittee proposed to hold an oversight hearing on the Act 
in 1996. During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee conducted 
an oversight hearing on the Coastal Barrier Resources System 
and approved legislation that removed certain acreage from 
Coastal Barrier units in Florida, New York, and South 
Carolina.These modifications were signed into law by the President 
(Public Law 104-148, Public Law 104-265 and Public Law 104-333).
    Marine Mammal Protection Act: This Act, first enacted in 
1972, governs a variety of subjects, including public display, 
scientific research, subsistence use of marine mammals, and the 
incidental take of marine mammals during commercial fishing 
operations. Last year, Congress enacted a comprehensive 
reauthorization bill, which made a number of important changes 
to the Act. The Subcommittee intended to hold an oversight 
hearing this Fall on the Act and to evaluate the effectiveness 
of the new provisions and the implementation of regulations by 
the appropriate agencies, but the Subcommittee took no action 
on this issue.
    North American Wetlands Conservation Act: The purpose of 
this Act is to conserve wetland ecosystems and the species they 
support, which are primarily waterfowl. While authorization of 
appropriations for this Act does not expire until September 30, 
1998, the Subcommittee proposed to hold an oversight hearing on 
the effectiveness of this Act. The Subcommittee took no action 
on this issue.

              Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources

                            i. introduction

     The Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources had 
successful legislative initiatives in the 104th Congress, with 
three bills becoming law. The most significant piece of 
legislation to be enacted was the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
Fairness and Simplification Act. This comprehensive law will 
serve both the Federal Government and the Federal lessee to 
streamline, clarify and provide certainty for royalty payments 
made for Federal onshore and Outer Continental Shelf oil and 
gas production. The Act is the first legislative initiative in 
13 years to cost-effectively increase the Nation's third 
largest source of revenue--oil and gas royalties. The bill 
enjoyed the support of 14 Governors from States cumulatively 
accounting for over 98 percent of the onshore Federal 
production. The Governors saw this bill as an avenue to 
participate more actively in collection of the significant 
source of revenue that Federal oil and gas production brings 
into the State treasuries. By assuming some of the Federal 
collection responsibilities, the States can do these jobs 
better, fairer, and less expensively, thereby increasing 
revenues to the State and Federal treasury.
     Legislation was also enacted to end the Federal 
Government's participation in the production and refining of 
helium. The Helium Act reduces the deficit, ensures repayment 
of the Federal helium program debt, returns all proceeds from 
the sale of the facilities and equipment to the Treasury, and 
applies all revenue received from the private sector as the 
result of crude helium sales towards repayment of the debt. The 
Act gets the Federal Government out of the helium business, 
including sale of the stockpile, and shuts down an inefficient 
helium refinery without undue disruption of the private helium.
     Additionally, legislation was enacted to authorize 
appropriations for a mining institute or institutes to develop 
domestic technological capabilities for the recovery of nonfuel 
minerals from the Nation's deep seabed, shallow Outer 
Continental Shelf sand and gravel resources, and arctic/cold 
water regions. A bill to reauthorize the National Geologic 
Mapping Act of 1992 was passed by the House of Representatives 
but failed to be acted upon by the full Senate.
     The Subcommittee held a legislative hearing on a bill to 
amend the Mineral Leasing Act to provide for a royalty payment 
for heavy crude oil produced from the public lands which is 
based on the degree of API gravity. The Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM) has always had the authority to grant royalty 
reduction on a case-by-case basis. However, the agency has not 
provided many lessees relief because of the onerous application 
process. The Subcommittee pursued the BLM's proposed rule in a 
legislative hearing to broaden the scope of the models used to 
justify the benefits and trade-offs of royalty relief for 
higher gravity oil.
     Furthermore, the Subcommittee held a legislative hearing 
and mark-up on a bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and 
Reclamation Act of 1977 to determine the proper role of Federal 
oversight of State regulatory programs. After more than a dozen 
years since most States achieved primacy under the Act, the 
Office of Surface Mining can, and does, exercise authority to 
issue notices of violation to coal operators in primacy states 
where a valid State-issued permit has already been granted. 
These enforcement actions remain contentious for those State 
governments that adequately regulate active coal mining and for 
which the Federal role ought to be limited to broad oversight 
of the adequacy of States' enforcement provisions.

                            ii. jurisdiction

    (1) All measures and matters concerning the U.S. Geological 
Survey.
    (2) All measures and matters affecting geothermal

reclamation of mined lands, the environmental effects of 
mining, and the management of mineral receipts, mineral land 
laws and claims, long-range mineral programs, and deep seabed 
mining.
    (5) Mining schools, experimental stations and long-range 
mineral programs.
    (6) Mineral resources on public lands.
    (7) Conservation and development of oil and gas resources 
of the Outer Continental Shelf.

  IV. Oversight Activities of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral 
                               Resources

A. Introduction

    The Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources was active 
in the oversight of Federal agencies and programs concerning 
exploration for and development (or nondevelopment, as the case 
may be) of minerals from Federal lands and interests in lands, 
including the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Additionally, the 
Subcommittee oversees the regulation of the impacts of surface-
mined coal (and lignite) anywhere in the U.S. irrespective of 
the mineral ownership through jurisdiction of the Surface 
Mining Control and Reclamation Act. In general, the 
Subcommittee's oversight activities endeavored to find ways to 
empower States with respect to decisions regarding onshore 
Federal mineral resources which clearly affect the States 
fiscally, and to establish rationale for reforms of OCS lease-
related provisions which now diminish receipts to the U.S. 
Treasury.
    Oversight hearings began immediately, with a hearing on the 
flight of domestic hardrock mineral exploration and development 
investment to overseas venues and its causes. Thereafter the 
Subcommittee examined the Fiscal Year 1996 budget proposals of 
the departmental agencies within its purview: the U.S. 
Geological Survey (USGS), Bureau of Mines, Minerals Management 
Service (MMS), Bureau of Land Management (energy and minerals 
programs), and Office of Surface Mining (OSM), with 
recommendations for the full committee budget views and 
estimates. The Subcommittee's recommendations with respect to 
OSM in particular were instrumental in the Appropriations 
Committee reporting a significantly reduced budget for that 
agency.
    Subsequently, the Subcommittee held oversight hearings on 
issues involving barriers to sodium mining in Wyoming; 
streamlining of onshore Federal oil and gas lease activities 
via State agency substitution; allowing ``primacy'' States to 
regulate coal mine operators with lessened Federal enforcement 
interference in permit decisions; and the Administration 
proposal to sell off the OCS royalty stream and devolve MMS 
functions to another Federal agency. Hearings on oversight of 
energy policy generally (in Houston) and specifically with 
respect to the potential for Federal lands (including the OCS) 
to provide an exploration base for new discoveries and to 
increase domestic reserves were also held. Thereafter the 
Subcommittee examined the USGS' mineral resources survey 
program, as reviewed by a panel of the National Academy of 
Science/National Research Council; the Bureau of Land 
Management's (BLM) regulatory burdens on small oil and gas 
operators; taking royalty in-kind (rather than in-value) for 
certain Gulf of Mexico natural gas production; leasing and/or 
development moratoria for various portions of the OCS; and 
progress on negotiations between the States and BLM toward 
State takeover of oil lease inspection duties.
    Agency Budget Oversight: The Subcommittee oversees four 
Interior Department agencies in toto and programs in two 
others: U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Bureau of Mines (BOM), 
Office of Surface Mining (OSM), Minerals Management Service 
(MMS), the energy and minerals program of the Bureau of Land 
Management (BLM), and the minerals and geology program of the 
Forest Service (FS). On February 14, 1995, the Subcommittee 
examined these agencies' programs for streamlining and 
privatization opportunities. Budget oversight of the science 
agencies (USGS, BOM) occurred February 23, 1995, and examined 
opportunities for contracting out work or otherwise 
streamlining research programs. Outside witnesses familiar with 
the programs' output testified regarding prioritizing programs/
turning work over to State agencies and the private sector, 
including orderly phase-out of the Federal Helium Reserve 
Program.
    The Subcommittee's oversight contributed to the Full 
Committee's fiscal year 1996 Views and Estimates report to the 
Committee on Budget concerning the aforementioned agencies. The 
Subcommittee concluded, in particular, that OSM could and 
should absorb a significant reduction commensurate with a 
proper role of oversight of primacy States' programs rather 
than its current practice of performing Federal oversight of 
the States through direct inspection and enforcement 
activities. Ultimately, both Congress and the Administration 
agreed, via the Omnibus Appropriations Act (Public Law 104-
131), which reduced OSM's Federal regulatory program budget by 
approximately 26 percent. Furthermore, Subcommittee 
recommendations regarding the Bureau of Mines and Geological 
Survey contributed to the merger of some of the former agency's 
functions into the latter, which was likewise mandated by 
Public Law 104-131. The other bureaus' programs within the 
Subcommittee bailiwick received little or none of the increase 
in funding sought by the Administration. For fiscal year 1997, 
the Subcommittee's oversight was less formal, but no less 
effective, as the Congress and the Administration effectively 
agreed to level funding for these programs.
    Hardrock Mineral Exploration and Development: The 
Subcommittee explored investment trends for so-called hardrock 
minerals mining in an effort to ascertain ways to improve the 
U.S. business climate for such ventures, particularly with 
respect to access to public lands for exploration and 
development. Such oversight is preparatory for beginning the 
legislative process for reform of the Mining Law of 1872.
    A hearing was held on January 31, 1995, examining factual 
investment data for trends in capital flow with industry and 
environmental testimony explaining reasons for these trends. An 
additional hearing with testimony from foreign nationals 
explaining their systems for balancing attracting investment 
versus regulatory oversight of mining proposals was scheduled 
after agency budget hearings in Spring 1995. A possible 
oversight hearing was proposed to focus on royalty definitional 
terms workable for the vast range of hardrock mineral 
commodities.
    The oversight gained on this issue led Chairmen Don Young 
(R-AK) and Ken Calvert (R-CA) to introduce H.R. 1580, a bill to 
amend the general mining laws to provide a reasonable royalty 
from mineral activities on Federal lands, to specify 
reclamation requirements for mineral activities, and to create 
a State program for the reclamation of abandoned hard rock 
mining sites. H.R. 1580 served generally as the basis for 
provisions within H.R. 2491, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, 
vetoed by the President on December 7, 1996, which would have 
levied a royalty on metallic (and certain other) minerals mined 
from public lands for the first time since 1847 when President 
Polk signed legislation repealing royalties on lead mined in 
Wisconsin and Missouri territories. Furthermore, H.R. 2491's 
Mining Law Revenue Act of 1995 would have required the payment 
of fair market value for the land within claim boundaries to be 
patented together with a right-of-reentry by the United States 
if the patented land is used for non-mining purposes 
thereafter.
    Coal Mining Regulatory Reform: The Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) governs the manner in which 
all coal is mined by surface methods in the U.S., and 
underground-mining operations for which surface impacts occur. 
SMCRA mandates regulatory primacy be turned over to the States 
which seek it and which meet a minimum program requirement. 
Since the mid-1980's all but two coal-producing States have 
achieved primacy, but OSM continues to ``second guess'' State 
regulatory agencies' decisions. Following the OSM budget 
oversight, the Subcommittee proposed to further explore 
abolition of the Federal oversight role of OSM.
    After an oversight hearing held on June 27, 1995, 
Congresswoman Barbara Cubin (R-WY) introduced H.R. 2372, a bill 
to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 
to minimize duplication in regulatory programs and to give 
States exclusive responsibility under approved State programs 
for permitting and enforcement of the provisions of that Act. A 
similar bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Robert F. 
Bennett (R-UT). A legislative hearing on H.R. 2372 was held in 
November, 1995, after which OSM and member States 
representatives of the Interstate Mining Compact Commission 
unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate their differences. A 
Subcommittee mark-up of H.R. 2372 was conducted in July, 1996. 
No further action was taken. As outlined above in the budget 
oversight section, OSM's program budget for Federal enforcement 
activities was significantly reduced in fiscal year 1996 and 
1997 from previous levels, largely because of the 
Subcommittee's posture on oversight and by action on H.R. 2372.
    Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Production-
Boosting Initiatives: The OCS Lands Act of 1954 governs the 
leasing of tracts in Federal waters off our coasts for oil and 
gas exploration. This program is by far the biggest revenue 
raiser of all Department of the Interior programs and is likely 
the second biggest in all the Federal Government (after the 
Internal Revenue Service). The MMS collects about $3 billion 
per year in bonus bids, rentals and royalties from oil and gas 
producers, a portion of which goes into the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund for Federal and State land acquisition 
programs. The OCS leasing program has been subjected to 
numerous leasing and drilling bans via appropriations bills, 
and threatened executive order. The Subcommittee proposed to 
investigate the rationale for retention versus elimination of 
such bans on activity in various waters in an effort to find 
acceptable ways to increase production from the OCS.
    Oversight hearings on ``energy policy'' generally were held 
in February and March 1996 with emphasis on the role of public 
lands and the OCS in raising domestic production levels. An 
oversight hearing on OCS leasing and drilling moratoria was 
held in July 1996 at which many Members expressed strong 
opinions regarding segments of the OCS adjacent to their 
States. No effective change from existing appropriations-based 
moratoria on OCS leasing was possible given the strongly 
bipartisan appeal for the status quo.
    The Subcommittee planned an oversight follow-up to a 103d 
Congress hearing into ``deepwater and frontier area'' royalty 
relief to stimulate investment in parts of the Gulf of Mexico 
and Alaskan OCS. Issues to be discussed included: Is it 
necessary at projected resource prices? How should such relief 
be configured? Without other measures such as alternative 
minimum tax relief will a royalty ``holiday'' stimulate 
drilling? Oversight of MMS' OCS Policy Committee recommendation 
for ``conflict resolution'' and of the property rights question 
regarding drilling bans on already leased OCS tracts were 
expected.
    The Subcommittee participated strongly in the legislative 
effort to promote development of greater than 200 meters water 
depths tracts in the western and central Gulf of Mexico region. 
Public Law 104-58 contained such provisions. The first lease 
sale held by MMS after enactment gained over one-third of a 
billion dollars for the U.S. Treasury in bonus bids, no doubt 
stimulated by the provisions of the deepwater royalty relief 
law.
    Onshore Federal Oil and Gas Initiatives: The BLM, lessor of 
Federal onshore minerals, is currently undergoing an oil and 
gas ``performance review.'' The Subcommittee proposed to hold 
an oversight hearing on the need for ``heavy oil'' royalty 
reduction to stimulate production from reservoirs with highly 
viscous crude oil, e.g. Kern County, California. The need for 
an oversight hearing was obviated when the Subcommittee held a 
legislative hearing on H.R. 699, a bill to amend the Mineral 
Leasing Act to provide for a royalty payment for heavy crude 
oil produced from the public lands which is based on the degree 
of API gravity. Thereafter, the BLM agreed administratively to 
reduce heavy oil royalties in a somewhat similar fashion, 
albeit with a slightly different formula. The pressure brought 
to bear by the Subcommittee's action clearly contributed to the 
action taken by the Administration.
     The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 grants rights-of-way to 
Federal lessees for pipelines from producing fields but 
obligates ``common carriers'' to ensure equitable access to the 
transportation system. The Subcommittee proposed to hold an 
oversight hearing to explore the issues of ensuring this 
obligation is being met everywhere. The Subcommittee worked 
behind the scenes with the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight's Subcommittee on Government Management investigating 
the Federal Government's potential loss of royalty revenue from 
undervaluation of crude oil from Federal onshore and OCS leases 
in California. A Department of the Interior-led task force 
reviewed these allegations and recently announced that the 
Secretary would make demands of twenty different oil company 
lessees of the U.S. for back royalties of approximately $400 
million, including interest. To date, approximately $160 
million of demands have issued.
    Disposition of Other Federal Minerals: The so-called 
fertilizer minerals, trona (a sodium carbonate mineral), 
phosphate and potash, are produced from Federal leases in 
California, Wyoming, Idaho and New Mexico. The Subcommittee 
proposed to hold an oversight hearing to examine a number of 
associated issues. An oversight hearing was held on May 9, 
1995, on the issue of proper valuation of royalty rates in a 
factual situation such as occurs in the Green River Basin of 
Wyoming. Governor Geringer of Wyoming, among others, testified 
as to the importance of the trona industry to the State. The 
Secretary of the Interior delayed for a year an increase in the 
royalty rate, perhaps as a result of the Subcommittee hearing, 
but later held a lease sale for several sections of trona 
leases at an eight percent royalty rate.

               Subcommittee on Water and Power Resources

                             i. introduction

A. Legislation to streamline the Federal Government and move power out 
        of Washington
    There was a recognition by the 104th Congress that although 
the Federal Government had built major civil works projects 
throughout the United States, the Government is now involved in 
operating facilities and programs in which there is no longer a 
compelling Federal interest. In addition, insufficient 
operation and maintenance funds are available to Federal 
agencies for the maintenance of these aging Federal facilities, 
many of which continue to deteriorate. These facilities could 
be better maintained by non-Federal entities, including water 
districts and other units of local government. Citing these 
concerns, the Subcommittee approved several bills to move 
facilities out of Federal ownership, including:
    S. 395/H.R. 1122 (Public Law 104-58), authorizes and 
directs the Secretary of Energy to sell the Alaska Power 
Administration.
    The Power Marketing Administration Sale/Study (the study 
provisions of this language were included in H.R. 2491, the 
Balanced Budget Act vetoed by the President). The Resources 
Committee bill would have sold the Southeastern Power 
Administration, the underlying power generation assets, and the 
associated dams and reservoirs. The bill provided for the 
control of rate increases, protection of existing contracts and 
obligations, placed the sale assets under the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission control, opened the sale to both 
customers and non-customers, and provided further information 
for evaluating the sale of the remaining Power Marketing 
Administrations.
    H.R. 3903, the Sly Park Unit Conveyance Act, would provide 
for the sale and conveyance by the Secretary of the Interior of 
the Sly Park Unit of the Central Valley Project to the El 
Dorado Irrigation District, Placerville, El Dorado County, 
California. The bill as amended was ordered favorably reported 
to the House of Representatives by voice vote (H. Rept. 104-
768).
    H.R. 3258, would direct the Secretary of the Interior to 
convey certain real property located within the Carlsbad 
Project in New Mexico to the Carlsbad Irrigation District. This 
bill was ordered reported from the Full Committee on September 
18, 1996. No further action was taken.
    Collbran Project Unit Conveyance. Language to direct the 
Secretary of the Interior to convey the Collbran Reclamation 
Project in Colorado to the Ute Water Conservancy District and 
the Collbran Conservancy District was approved by the Congress 
as part of H.R. 2491, the Balanced Budget Act, which was vetoed 
by the President.
B. Legislation to improve existing Federal programs and enhance agency 
        flexibility
    Several bills approved by the Subcommittee are designed to 
improve existing Federal programs by refocusing goals to meet 
contemporary needs, tightening or restructuring eligibility 
criteria, reducing authorization ceilings to reflect 
appropriations levels, or providing agencies with flexibility 
to make Treasury payments. Legislation approved by the 
Subcommittee in this area includes:
    H.R. 930 (Public Law 104-20), amends the Colorado River 
Basin Salinity Control Act to authorize additional measures to 
carry out the control of salinity upstream of Imperial Dam in a 
cost-effective manner. Salinity in the Colorado River increases 
dramatically as the River makes its 1,400-mile journey. Almost 
half of the salinity occurs naturally, although another major 
contributor to the River's salinity is the use of water for 
agriculture. The new program would enable the Bureau of 
Reclamation to accept proposals from non-Federal entities for 
salinity control measures, and then provide funding to the most 
cost-effective proposals. The existing salinity control program 
was inflexible and relied on expensive hardware solutions to 
water quality problems. Public Law 104-20 will for the first 
time allow private companies and other organizations to 
participate in creative solutions to salinity control in the 
Colorado River Basin.
    H.R. 799, Bonneville Power Administration Appropriations 
Refinancing Act, provides for the reconstitution of outstanding 
repayment obligations of the Administrator of the Bonneville 
Power Administration (BPA) for the appropriated capital 
investments in the Federal Columbia River Power System. This 
Act raised the low interest rates on BPA's old appropriated 
debt up to current Treasury rates. The Act actually increased 
revenues to the U.S. Treasury, because BPA agreed to pay an 
additional $100 million to be able to restructure this debt. An 
amended version of this bill was incorporated into Public Law 
104-134.
    H.R. 1743 (Public Law 104-147), reauthorizes an ongoing 
program administered through the United States Geological 
Survey. It provides a research funding program at the 54 State 
Water Resources Research Institutes located at the land grant 
university in each of the 50 States and several of the 
territories. These institutes are a primary link between the 
academic community, the water-related personnel in Federal and 
State government, and the private sector. The law reduces the 
authorization ceiling to reflect amounts actually appropriated 
for the program in recent years.
    H.R. 1823 (Public Law 104-286), provides the Secretary of 
the Interior with the authority to accept prepayment from the 
Central Utah Water Conservancy District for the costs of 
certain project features associated with the Bonneville Unit of 
the Central Utah Project. This legislation will result in the 
Federal treasury receiving repayment by 2002 of over $140 
million that would otherwise be repaid through 2048.
     H.R. 3660 (Public Law 104-266), the Reclamation Wastewater 
and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act. This law amends a 
1992 act (Public Law 102-575) that directed the Secretary of 
the Interior to study cost-shared opportunities to reclaim and 
reuse wastewater and naturally impaired ground and surface 
water, and authorized five specific feasibility studies and 
four demonstration projects. H.R. 3660 adds several new 
projects that would be eligible to receive Federal cost-share 
funding under the existing program. Further, the bill 
establishes more stringent criteria for receiving 
appropriations for any project, including requirements for 
feasibility studies and for cost-sharing agreements with the 
Secretary of the Interior.
     H.R. 2738, the Central Valley Project Reform Act. This 
bill was intended to address concerns that had been raised 
about the implementation of the 1992 Central Valley Project 
Improvement Act (Title XXIV of Public Law 102-575). The bill 
was ordered reported from the Committee on December 13, 1995, 
but further action was suspended on the bill in May 1996, at 
the request of California water users and Interior Department 
officials. The bill did result in a formal administrative 
process involving the various stakeholders, initiated by the 
Interior Department in late 1995, to address ongoing problems 
with implementation of the 1992 Act. The success of this 
administrative process has yet to be determined, and it will be 
the subject of additional oversight hearings by the 
Subcommittee in the 105th Congress.

C. Legislation targeted to resolving specific problems

     The Subcommittee approved several bills in the 104th 
Congress aimed at solving problems in specific geographic 
locations, or at targeting scarce Federal research funds. The 
bills moved by the Subcommittee to meet these objectives 
include:
     S. 811 (Public Law 104-298), Water Desalinization Research 
and Development Act of 1996, authorizes research into the 
desalinization and reclamation of water and authorizes a 
program for States, cities, or qualifying agencies desiring to 
own and operate a water desalinization or reclamation facility 
to develop such facilities, and for other purposes.
     S. 1467/H.R. 2819 (Public Law 104-300), Fort Peck Rural 
Water Supply System Act. This Act authorizes appropriations of 
$5.8 million for the construction of a rural water supply 
distribution facility for Fort Peck Rural County Water 
District, Montana. Currently, 95 percent of the residents of 
the area must haul their drinking water from Fort Peck Lake to 
meet domestic needs. The process of hauling water is difficult 
and expensive, particularly during the cold winter months. In 
addition, this area receives more than 280,000 visits each year 
by recreational users at Fort Peck Reservoir, and a reliable 
supply of good quality drinking water is needed to serve these 
visitors. The Act contains a sunset provision that deauthorizes 
the project if appropriations are not obtained within a 
specified timeframe.
     H.R. 3910 (Public Law 104-318), Emergency Drought Relief 
Act of 1996. This Act provides emergency drought relief to the 
City of Corpus Christi and the Canadian River Municipal Water 
Authority, both in Texas, by suspending their repayment 
obligations to the Federal Government for five and three years, 
respectively. This will free up the money they need to develop 
alternate water supplies. The Act also provides that if the 
construction of alternative water supplies for the City of 
Corpus Christi requires a Federal permit for use of Bureau of 
Reclamation lands or facilities, the Secretary of the Interior 
shall issue such permit within 90 days of enactment.

                            II. Jurisdiction

    (1) Generation and marketing of electric power from Federal 
water projects by Federally chartered or Federal regional power 
marketing authorities.
    (2) All measures and matters concerning water resources 
planning conducted pursuant to the Water Resources Planning 
Act, water resource research and development programs, saline 
water research and development.
    (3) Compacts relating to the use and apportionment of 
interstate waters, water rights, and major interbasin water or 
power movement programs.
    (4) All measures and matters pertaining to irrigation and 
reclamation projects and other water resources development 
programs, including policies and procedures.
    (5) General and continuing oversight and investigative 
authority over activities, policies and programs within the 
jurisdiction of the Subcommittee.

    IV. oversight activities of the subcommittee on water and power 
                               resources

A. Introduction

    Budget Overview: The Subcommittee proposed to hold a 
hearing on that portion of the President's budget proposal 
falling within its jurisdiction each year. The Subcommittee 
held a hearing on that portion of the President's budget 
proposal falling within its jurisdiction on March 7, 1995. 
Administration officials representing the Department of Energy 
and the Department of the Interior testified.
    Central Valley Project Improvement Act Implementation 
(CVPIA): The Subcommittee proposed to review actions taken by 
Federal, State and other organizations to implement the various 
provisions of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act 
(CVPIA). Early in the 104th Congress, the Resources Committee 
was contacted by a number of California interests, including 
irrigation districts, municipalities, and power customers 
concerned about the way provisions of the CVPIA were being 
implemented or interpreted. The Subcommittee held four hearings 
(in California as well as in Washington) related to the 
implementation of the CVPIA. In June of 1995, legislation was 
introduced to reform the CVPIA. After the introduction of the 
CVPIA Reform Act, the Department of the Interior started an 
administrative process to resolve problems with the 
implementation of the CVPIA--an explicit recognition that 
significant problems existed. The Subcommittee held an 
oversight hearing on the status of the administrative process. 
At that hearing, the Administration witness requested that 
action on the bill be suspended until the administrative 
process was completed. In May 1996, action on the CVPIA reform 
bill was suspended, conditioned on the administrative process 
producing real results and meeting its self-imposed deadlines.
    On September 12, 1996, the Subcommittee held another 
oversight hearing on the administrative process. At that 
hearing, two stakeholder groups testified that some legislative 
changes to the CVPIA will be needed once the administrative 
process is completed. Some deadlines in the administrative 
process have slipped, and there is an ongoing concern that 
certain problems are not being addressed through the process at 
all.
    Regulation Reform: The Subcommittee proposed to review the 
need for and advisability of reducing and eliminating those 
Federal rules and regulations falling within its jurisdiction. 
The Subcommittee conducted numerous investigations and informal 
reviews concerning the Bureau of Reclamation's regulatory 
program. Subcommittee Chairman John T. Doolittle (R-CA) joined 
Chairman Don Young (R-AK) in urging the Department of the 
Interior to comply with court settlements requiring the 
reissuance of the water conservation regulations under the 
Reclamation Reform Act of 1982. No formal Subcommittee hearings 
or other actions were taken.
    Restructuring the Bureau of Reclamation: The Subcommittee 
proposed to review current efforts to downsize the Bureau of 
Reclamation and will consider new proposals relating to the 
further reduction or termination of the existence of that 
bureau. The Subcommittee held several hearings on Bureau of 
Reclamation operations. These hearings included: a March 30, 
1995, oversight hearing on Bureau of Reclamation operational 
issues; a June 15, 1995, oversight hearing on the possible 
transfer of Reclamation facilities out of Federal control; 
field hearings in Oregon and Idaho in October 1995 on Federal 
Government actions affecting water rights; and a March 7, 1996, 
hearing on dams safety and deferred maintenance issues at 
Bureau of Reclamation facilities. The Subcommittee approved 
several bills to transfer specific Reclamation facilities out 
of Federal ownership, thereby reducing the size and scope of 
the Bureau of Reclamation.
    California Bay--Delta Agreement: The Subcommittee proposed 
to review the agreement reached between the Federal Government, 
the State of California and various other parties relating to 
the protection of the Sacramento Delta estuary and the supply 
of water to farms and cities in a major portion of California. 
The issues related to the implementation of the December 1994 
agreement are similar, and in some instances linked, to the 
implementation of the 1992 Central Valley Project Improvement 
Act (CVPIA). The Subcommittee's actions on the CVPIA are 
discussed above. However, the Committee was supportive of 
efforts to fund the Federal share of a balanced, long-term 
solution to the problems of the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-
San Joaquin Delta Watershed. This authorization language was 
included in Public Law 104-333 and Public Law 104-208.
    Central Arizona Project Debt Repayment: The Subcommittee 
proposed to review proposals made by the Administration to 
restructure the debt currently held by the owners of the 
Central Arizona Project. Negotiations to reach a settlement 
agreement on the repayment issues pertaining to the Central 
Arizona Project (CAP) were unsuccessful, and these issues are 
now in litigation. The litigation has limited the ability of 
the Subcommittee to investigate certain issues that are the 
subject of the lawsuit. However, the Subcommittee did ask the 
General Accounting Office to conduct a preliminary 
investigation concerning the appropriateness of the Bureau of 
Reclamation's use of funds from the Lower Colorado River Basin 
Development Fund for certain costs related to the Central 
Arizona Project. The Subcommittee staff have also received 
briefings from the Department on the various Basin Funds, and 
on the operation of the Central Arizona Project. In addition, 
Chairman John T. Doolittle (R-CA) wrote the Department in 
September 1996 asking detailed questions about CAP operations. 
The Subcommittee will continue its oversight of the Bureau's 
role in the Central Arizona Project. Hearings are possible in 
the 105th Congress.
    Sale of Federal Power Marketing Administrations: The 
Subcommittee proposed to review proposals to sell those 
agencies within the Department of Energy known as power 
marketing administrations (PMAs) which market the electrical 
power produced at Federal water projects. The Resources 
Committee approved provisions in its part of the reconciliation 
bill that would have sold the Southeastern Power 
Administration, the underlying power generation assets, and the 
associated dams and reservoirs. The bill provided for the 
control of rate increases, protection of existing contracts and 
obligations, placed the sale assets under Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission control, opened the sale to both 
customers and non-customers, and provided further information 
for evaluating the sale of the remaining PMAs. However, only a 
study version of this language was included in H.R. 2491, the 
Balanced Budget Act vetoed by the President.
    The debate over the various PMA proposals introduced or 
considered during the First Session of the 104th Congress 
raised many policy issues. Therefore, in December 1995 Chairman 
John T. Doolittle (R-CA) sent a letter to the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) requesting that the GAO conduct certain 
investigations. This request resulted in three separate GAO 
reports that were the subject of the following hearings: May 2, 
1996, hearing on Pick-Sloan Project Repayment Issues; July 25, 
1996, hearing on Deferred Maintenance and Energy Reliability 
Issues at Facilities Generating Power Marketed by the 
Southeastern Power Administration; September 19, 1996, hearing 
on accounting practices for Federal power marketing 
administrations.
    Oversight of Bonneville Power Administration Management: 
The Subcommittee proposed to hold hearings on the actions taken 
by the management of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) 
relating to various matters of concern. The Subcommittee agreed 
to defer significant actions on the management of the 
Bonneville Power Administration until the December 1996 
completion of the Comprehensive Review of the Northwest Energy 
System, a regional review commissioned by the four Northwest 
Governors.
    Nonetheless, the Subcommittee did hold two hearings on BPA-
related issues. The first hearing was on May 21, 1996, on 
Bonneville Power Administration Operations and the Status of 
the Comprehensive Review of the Northwest Energy System. The 
second hearing was a field hearing on November 7, 1996, on 
issues and recommendations concerning the August 10, 1996, 
Bonneville/Western U.S. Power Outage.
    In addition, the Committee approved H.R. 799, the 
``Bonneville Power Administration Appropriations Refinancing 
Act,'' as amended, which provides for the reconstitution of 
outstanding repayment obligations of the Administrator of the 
Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) for the appropriated 
capital investments in the Federal Columbia River Power System. 
This Act raised the low interest rates on BPA's old 
appropriated debt up to current Treasury rates. The Act 
actually increased revenues to the U.S. Treasury, because BPA 
agreed to pay an additional $100 million to be able to 
restructure this debt. An amended version of H.R. 799 was 
eventually incorporated into Public Law 104-134.
    Hoover Dam Visitors Center: The Subcommittee proposed to 
hold hearings on the expenditures over budget for the Hoover 
Dam Visitors center. Bureau of Reclamation officials were 
subjected to lengthy questioning on this issue at the March 30, 
1995, oversight hearing on Bureau of Reclamation operational 
issues. Written follow-up questions on Hoover Dam were also 
submitted to the Department.
    Oversight of Colorado River Operations: The Subcommittee 
proposed to hold hearings on the operation of the Colorado 
River in both the Upper and Lower basins. The Subcommittee held 
a May 11, 1995, hearing to examine the significant impacts of 
high salinity levels on human health and the environment. The 
Subcommittee subsequently moved legislation, now Public Law 
104-20, to revise the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control 
Program.
    With respect to the impact of hydropower production on 
Colorado River operations, the Subcommittee held a March 19, 
1996, oversight hearing on Western Area Power Administration 
Construction and Maintenance Activities and Bureau of 
Reclamation Power Facilities Management.
    Further, the issues raised with respect to the Central 
Arizona Project, discussed above, are linked to any 
investigation of Colorado River Operations, since the CAP was 
constructed to deliver Colorado River water within Arizona.
    Water Technology Development: The Subcommittee proposed to 
hold hearings on various aspects of water technology 
development which will impact Federal waste water reclamation 
activities. Although the Subcommittee did not hold hearings on 
water technology development, the Committee did approve two 
bills to address waste water reclamation. They are: H.R. 3660 
(Public Law 104-266), the Reclamation Wastewater and 
Groundwater Study and Facilities Act; and S. 811 (Public Law 
104-298), the Water Desalinization Research and Development Act 
of 1996.
    DOI Irrigation Drainage Program: The Subcommittee proposed 
to hold hearings on the Department of the Interior's Irrigation 
Drainage Program. A major unresolved drainage issue at the 
beginning of the 104th Congress was how to allocate the costs 
for the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program and the cleanup of 
selenium from drainage water at the Kesterson Wildlife Refuge 
in California. This cost-allocation issue was finally resolved 
in the fiscal year 1997 Energy and Water Development 
Appropriations Act. Chairmen Don Young (R-AK) and John T. 
Doolittle (R-CA) wrote in support of this agreement. Beyond 
this action, the Subcommittee took no further actions on the 
Department's Irrigation Drainage Program.

          Subcommittee on Native American and Insular Affairs

                            i. introduction

A. Native American Issues
    A large number of bills relating to Native Americans was 
considered by the 104th Congress. The following is a 
compilation of that Native American-related legislation, 
referred to the Resources Committee and, in most instances, to 
the Native American and Insular Affairs Subcommittee, which 
were enacted into law:
          The Advisory Council on California Indian Policy Act 
        was amended to extend the term of the Advisory Council 
        from 18 to 36 months.
          Public Law 104-16 was enacted to reauthorize funding 
        for two years for grants to tribes for treatment 
        programs for Indians who have been victims of child 
        sexual abuse, for the development of Indian Child 
        Protection and Family Violence Prevention programs, and 
        for the funding of Indian Child Resource and Family 
        Service Centers.
          The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development 
        Trust Fund Act of 1996, Public Law 104-223, was enacted 
        to create a $27.5 million dollar development fund to 
        provide the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe with resources for 
        health care facilities, a water system, recreational 
        facilities, and other projects and programs.
          Legislation was enacted which amends the Utah Schools 
        and Lands Improvement Act to provide for lands and 
        mineral interests to be added to the Goshute Indian 
        Reservation.
          Legislation was enacted to amend the Indian Health 
        Care Improvement Act to extend the demonstration 
        program for direct billing of Medicare, Medicaid, and 
        other third party payers.
          The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 
        was enacted to implement a Federal court-ordered 
        settlement agreement entered into between the Hopi 
        Tribe, Navajo families who reside of Hopi lands, and 
        the Federal Government.
          The Indian Environmental General Assistance Program 
        Act, which provides funding to all Tribes for the 
        implementation of solid and hazardous waste programs, 
        was reauthorized by Public Law 104-233.
          Section 401 of Public Law 100-581 was amended to

        any or all provisions of Title 1, which deals with 
        Public Law 93-638 contracts, in Title III and Title IV 
        Self-Governance compacts. That Act was also amended by 
        Public Law 104-133 to extend the authority for 
        promulgating regulations under the Act.
          The Jicarilla Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement

          Legislation was enacted to revoke the charter of 
        incorporation of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, as 
        requested by the Tribe, pursuant to the Indian 
        Reorganization Act.

        the Ponca Restoration Act was amended to modify the 
        service area of the Tribe to include tribal members 
        living in Sarpy, Burt, Platte, Stantion, Hall, Holt and 
        Wayne counties in Nebraska and tribal members living in 
        Woodbury and Pottawattomie counties in Iowa.
          Legislation was enacted to revoke the charter of 
        incorporation of the Prairie Island Indian Community, 
        as requested by the Tribe, pursuant to the Indian 
        Reorganization Act.
          Public Law 104-102 was enacted to ratify and 
        implement a land settlement agreement between the 
        Resolution Trust Corporation, the City of Scottsdale, 
        and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.
          The San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement 
        Act was amended to extend until June 30, 1997, the

                  (11) the Tlingit and Haida Status 
                Clarification Act.

B. Insular Affairs

     The Subcommittee on Native American and Insular Affairs 
legislative focus on insular issues centered on increasing 
local self-government in the islands and reforming Federal 
policies for the administration of the insular areas. 
Significant legislative accomplishments reflected in laws 
enacted during the 104th Congress included the termination of 
the Department of the Interior's Office of Territorial and 
International Affairs and the political position of the 
Assistant Secretary for Territorial and International Affairs, 
reduction in the size of unnecessary Federal territorial staff 
and programmatic funding, phase-out of the special annual grant 
to the Northern Mariana Islands, and completion of a final 
resettlement plan for Rongelap Atoll. In addition, legislation 
was reported by the Committee to establish a process leading to 
the resolution of Puerto Rico's political status, the largest 
island group with 90 percent of the population of all of 
America's territories. These legislative and other activities 
include:
     Title I of H.R. 602 (later incorporated into H.R. 1332) 
terminated the Department of the Interior Office of Territorial 
and International Affairs and the position of Assistant 
Secretary, and reduced Federal insular staff and program 
funding was provided for in the Fiscal Year 1997 Appropriations 
Act (Public Law 104-208).
     Title III of H.R. 1332, which was reported by the 
Committee, would have immediately eliminated the annual special 
grant to the Northern Mariana Islands. Congress enacted an 
alternative phased-out of the funds in the 1997 Fiscal Year 
Appropriations Act (Public Law 104-208).
     Originating as Title I of H.R. 1332, Public Law 104-208 
provided for a final resettlement of the Rongelap Community and 
the radiological rehabilitation of the atoll.
     H.R. 3024 provided a Federally-authorized process to 
resolve Puerto Rico's political status. Similar legislation was 
introduced in the Senate, S. 2019. The bill was reported 
unanimously by the Subcommittee and favorably by the Committees 
on Resources and Rules.
     Title III of H.R. 602 would grant Hawaii jurisdiction for 
seven small U.S. territorial islands and atolls near the State. 
The legislation received support from the Senate of Hawaii, 
which adopted S.R. No. 21 on April 10, 1995, urging the 
Congress to support this provision. Companion legislation was 
introduced in the Senate (see S. 1906).
     H.R. 3634, the Virgin Islands Organic Revision Act of 
1996, was incorporated into H.R. 1332 and passed by the House. 
The measure increased the powers of local self-government for 
the Virgin Islands.
     Title VII of H.R. 3721 provided a non-paid commission of 
limited duration involving the private sector to consider 
alternative economic development strategies for the Virgin 
Islands. The bill passed the House as part of H.R. 1332.
     H.R. 2254 repealed the separate ballot requirement for the 
Delegate representing Guam. The bill was incorporated into H.R. 
1332 and passed by the House.
     H.R. 2624 established a non-paid commission of 18-months 
to address American Samoa's history and economic options. The 
bill was incorporated into H.R. 1332.
     H.R. 1306 provided funding for economic development in 
American Samoa. The bill was incorporated into H.R. 1332. An 
alternative funding provision for American Samoa was provided 
for in the Fiscal Year 1996 Appropriations Act (Public Law 104-
134).
     H.J. Res. 192, the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act 
Amendments, was incorporated into H.R. 1332 and passed by the 
House.
     H.R. 4067 would authorize the local election of a non-
voting delegate to Congress for the Northern Mariana Islands. 
The bill was reported from the Committee on Resources.
     H.R. 602 would authorize a commission to identify those 
individuals on Guam who qualify for World War II restitution. 
The bill was incorporated into H.R. 2041 and ordered reported.
     H.R. 2159, which would provide for the transfer of certain 
lands on the Island of Vieques, Puerto Rico, to the 
Municipality of Vieques, was approved by the Subcommittee.

                            II. jurisdiction

    (1) Except for Native Alaskans, measures relating to the 
welfare of Native Americans, including management of Indian 
lands in general and special measures relating to claims which 
are paid out of Indian funds.
    (2) Except for Native Alaskans, all matters regarding the 
relations of the United States with the Indians and the Indian 
tribes, including special oversight functions under clause 3(e) 
of Rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
    (3) All matters regarding Native Hawaiians.
    (4) Except for Native Alaskans, all matters related to the 
Federal trust responsibility to Native Americans and the 
sovereignty of Native Americans.
    (5) All matters regarding insular areas of the United 
States.
    (6) All measures or matters regarding the Freely Associated 
States and Antarctica.
    (7) Cooperative efforts to encourage, enhance and improve 
international programs for the protection of the environment 
and the conservation of natural resources within the 
jurisdiction of the Committee.
    (8) General and continuing oversight and investigative 
authority over activities, policies and programs within the 
jurisdiction of the Subcommittee.

  IV. Oversight Activities of the Subcommittee on Native American and 
                            Insular Affairs

A. Introduction

            Native American Issues
    Budget Overview: The Subcommittee held a hearing on that 
portion of the President's budget proposal falling within its 
jurisdiction for Fiscal Year 1996.
    Administration of Indian Trust Accounts: The Task Force on 
Indian Trust Fund Management was created to review actions 
taken by the Department of the Interior to audit and account 
for mismanagement of Indian trust accounts. Much of the money 
which tribes receive from land or water settlements or treaty 
provisions, and which individual tribal members receive from 
the same sources or from oil or gas leases on reservation, is 
placed in trust fund accounts managed by the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs (BIA).
    Hearings were held in Washington, D.C., Anchorage, Alaska, 
and Phoenix, Arizona. It was found that there are almost 
317,000 such accounts and that the Department of the Interior 
(DOI), in reviewing a mere 2000 of these accounts, could not 
reconcile $2.4 billion in account transactions conducted since 
1972. It is expected that a new Task Force will be created 
during the 105th Congress to continue that work performed 
during the 104th Congress.
    Regulation Reform: The Subcommittee staff reviewed the need 
for and advisability of reducing and eliminating those Federal 
rules and regulations falling within its jurisdiction. Hearings 
were not held but may become necessary during the 105th 
Congress.
    Restructuring of the Bureau of Indian Affairs: The 
Subcommittee staff reviewed various proposals to reorganize the 
BIA. It has been alleged that the BIA is the worst-run and most 
inept Federal agency in the Federal Government. The 
Subcommittee was concerned about claims by tribes that most of 
the money appropriated to the BIA is never received by the 
tribes, but is eaten up by the bureaucracy. These claims were 
disputed by officials within the DOI. Oversight hearings on 
proposals to reorganize the BIA may be held during the 105th 
Congress.
    Promulgation of Rules Concerning Scope of Self Governance 
Program: Under the BIA's Self-Governance Program, tribes can 
contract with the BIA to perform services formerly provided by 
that agency. For example, the BIA maintains police forces on 
several reservations. Under self governance, a tribe can 
contract with the BIA to provide the service itself. The BIA 
then transfers to the tribe the block of funds allocated for 
that tribe's police force and allows the tribe do the hiring, 
supervision, and control. The Subcommittee staff reviewed the 
rules promulgated by the BIA concerning the scope of the 
programs which fall within the range of those tribes which 
choose to participate in the Self Governance Program.
    Indian Gaming: The Subcommittee held hearings concerning 
various proposals to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 
1988 as well as the activities of the Indian Gaming Commission 
created pursuant to that Act. Although the conduct of Indian 
gaming has resulted in extensive litigation throughout the 
Nation, the 104th Congress, like those Congresses preceding it, 
was unable to craft and pass legislation which would resolve 
the many gaming-related issues in dispute between tribes and 
the States.
            Insular Affairs
    The Subcommittee on Native American and Insular Affairs 
dealt with oversight of insular issues primarily through 
legislative and oversight hearings in Washington and in the 
islands. The following are the oversight activities of the 
Subcommittee in addressing the insular affairs priorities 
identified in the Committee's Oversight Plan for the 104th 
Congress:
    Economic Self-Sufficiency through Trade in U.S. 
Territories: A legislative hearing was held in Washington 
regarding ``Consultation of and Efforts to Include Territories 
Regarding Free Trade Agreements,'' as contained in Title VII of 
H.R. 602. Oversight meetings were conducted with private 
industry in certain territories regarding the process of 
becoming part of the United States Custom Territory. There was 
continuous monitoring of the expansion of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and the development of the Asia-Pacific 
free trade agreement of the Asia Pacific Economic Conference 
and the impact on the inclusion and exclusion of the 
territories.
    The Impact of the Contract With America for the 
Territories: A legislative hearing was held which addressed the 
adverse impact of the current fiscal relationship between the 
Federal Government and the territories. The General Accounting 
Office produced testimony and documentation regarding the 
negative Federal budgetary impact due to the lack of fiscal 
integration: Federal expenditure in the territories exceeds 
receipts by more than $9 billion per year. The territories do 
not pay Federal taxes (except for Social Security taxes and 
certain fees and taxes on U.S.-source income) and a possessions 
tax credit. Generic legislation was developed to provide a 
mechanism for territories to opt for fiscal integration in 
exchange for special economic and fiscal incentives and equal 
treatment in benefits. Meetings were conducted with other 
Committees with fiscal, budget, and programmatic jurisdiction 
to develop a legislative proposal which produced a net gain in 
revenue to the U.S. Treasury while permitting fiscal 
integration with the territories. Congress acted to phase-out 
the possessions tax credit over ten years, but without 
providing for alternative economic and fiscal incentives and 
the option of fiscal integration for the territories (see 
Public Law 104-188 and GAO reports GAO/GGD-95-71 AND GAO/GGD-
96-184R).
    Consolidating Smaller Island Possessions: A legislative 
hearing was held regarding ``The Insular Areas Consolidation 
Act,'' a major provision of H.R. 602. This measure would give 
the State of Hawaii the option for including in the State's 
jurisdiction a number of smaller territories which have 
historical, cultural, and geographic links to Hawaii. This 
would provide for increased local control over the future use 
of the islands by eliminating Federal administration. 
Discussions were conducted with offices of the Governor of 
Hawaii, members of the Legislature, other organizations and the 
owners of two of the islands. The Senate of Hawaii enacted 
Senate Resolution No. 21, supporting the ``Insular Areas 
Consolidation Act,'' of H.R. 602. Companion legislation was 
introduced in the Senate, S. 1906.
    Modification of Authority to the Northern Mariana Islands 
(NMI): Legislative and oversight hearings were held on a number 
of proposals to change Federal policies in the NMI regarding 
temporary authority provided to the islands before the 
residents became U.S. citizens and under the sovereignty of the 
United States. In part as a result of the Federal oversight 
process, the NMI modified their local tax rebate structure, 
increased enforcement of immigration practices, and authorized 
the establishment of an NMI private-public wage review board to 
establish a minimum wage on an industry-by-industry basis. 
Congress also acted to phase-out a special annual grant to the 
NMI, considered extending some mechanism to establish a Federal 
minimum wage, reviewed immigration practices and policies in 
the islands, and filed a report on the need for a non-voting 
delegate from the NMI to the House of Representatives.
    Responding to the Results of the Puerto Rico Plebiscite: A 
joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Native American and 
Insular Affairs and the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere of 
the Committee on International Relations was held in Washington 
during the first session of the 104th Congress on the results 
of the November 1993 Puerto Rico Status Plebiscite, in which a 
locally-defined enhanced ``Commonwealth'' definition received 
48 percent of the vote, versus 46 percent for statehood, and 
four percent for independence. The Puerto Rico legislature 
requested Congress to respond to the plebiscite and to clarify 
what were the acceptable status alternatives to resolve Puerto 
Rico's status problem. Extensive discussions were held 
regarding all status alternatives. Formal separate responses 
from Chairmen and Minority Ranking Members of the committees of 
jurisdiction regarding various aspects of Puerto Rico's status 
were transmitted to the leadership of the Puerto Rico House and 
Senate regarding the lack of viability of the 1993 enhanced 
``Commonwealth'' ballot definition.
    Extensive testimony was received during the Subcommittee's 
legislative hearing in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the United 
States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, H.R. 3024. Continuing 
dialogue was conducted with the proponents of different status 
options for Puerto Rico, with numerous suggestions being 
incorporated into the legislation. An extensive report, H. 
Rept. 104-713, Parts I and II, was filed on H.R. 3024, 
legislation to provide a final response to the Puerto Rico 
plebiscite results through a complete and balanced process 
leading to full self-government for Puerto Rico. Additional 
discussions and input without and within the Congress regarding 
the substance and scope of a response to Puerto Rico's 
political status resulted in modifications contained in an 
Updated United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act, H.R. 
4281. Discussions were also conducted on a bicameral basis and 
similar legislation was introduced in the Senate, S. 2019.
    American Samoa Self-Sufficiency: Oversight and legislative 
hearings were conducted on various proposals to provide for 
increased self-sufficiency in American Samoa. Discussions were 
conducted with former and current leaders as well as the 
private sector on ways to improve the economy and efficiency in 
local government. Considerable input was sought and received 
from the Department of the Interior Inspector General regarding 
the establishment of measurable audit criteria to be used to 
advance accountability and self-sufficiency by the American 
Samoa Government. Congress enacted limited standards as 
conditions for receiving certain appropriated Federal funds for 
capital improvements and considered the establishment of a non-
paid private-public commission to examine in part economic 
development alternatives for American Samoa.
    Oversight of the progress of the Compacts of Free 
Association: A joint hearing was held by the Subcommittee on 
Native American and Insular Affairs and the Subcommittee on 
Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on International 
Relations regarding the Micronesian compacts of Free 
Association. Testimony was secured and input sought from 
diverse U.S. government and private sectors regarding the 
success of the current relationships under the Compacts and 
future prospects. Oversight is crucial as the United States is 
getting closer to the end of two 15-year relationships defined 
in Compacts of Free Association with the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.
    Disposal of Water Island in the Virgin Islands: Letters 
were written to the Department of the Interior during the first 
session to spur the Administration in completing the transfer 
of title of residential home sites to the lessees who had 
entered into contracts to purchase their lots in 1992. Title 
was transferred to private lessees and to the local government 
after two hearings of the Subcommittee in the second session of 
Congress.
