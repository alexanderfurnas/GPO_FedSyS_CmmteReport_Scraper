       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3517) making 
appropriations for military construction, family housing, and 
base realignment and closure for the Department of Defense for 
the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other 
purposes, submit the following joint statement to the House and 
the Senate in explanation of the effect of the action agreed 
upon by the managers and recommended in the accompanying 
report.

                       items of general interest

      Matters Addressed by Only One Committee.--The language 
and allocations set forth in House Report 104-591 and Senate 
Report 104-287 should be complied with unless specifically 
addressed to the contrary in the conference report and 
statement of the managers. Report language included by the 
House which is not changed by the report of the Senate or the 
conference, and Senate report language which is not changed by 
the conference is approved by the committee of conference. The 
statement of the managers, while repeating some report language 
for emphasis, does not intend to negate the language referred 
to above unless expressly provided herein. In cases in which 
the House or the Senate have directed the submission of a 
report from the Department of Defense, such report is to be 
submitted to both House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations.
      Base Realignment and Closure.--The conferees agree to 
provide specific approval and appropriated funds for all Base 
Realignment and Closure construction projects as listed in 
House Report 104-591.
      National Foreign Intelligence Requirements.--The 
conferees expect any military construction requirements related 
to the National Foreign Intelligence Program to be subject to 
the same level of scrutiny and justification as any other 
Defense requirement coming before the Military Construction 
Appropriations Subcommittees. Insufficient review within the 
Department and disregard for Congressional authorization and 
appropriation procedures has created a number of 
misunderstandings, which the conferees expect will be avoided 
in the future.
      Rescissions.--The conferees recommend a total of 
$22,428,000 in rescissions of prior-year appropriations for the 
military services and defense agencies as proposed by the 
Senate, rather than a total of $12,000,000 as proposed by the 
House. The rescissions recommended in the bill include the 
following items which have contract savings or which were 
previously approved and now are no longer needed:

Army 1994-1998:
    Kwajalein Atoll--Roi Namur Island: Sewage treatment 
      facility..........................................      $2,028,000
Navy 1993-1997:
    Virginia--Norfolk NSC: Cold storage warehouse.......       3,000,000
    Virginia--Intelligence Training Center, Norfolk: 
      Applied instruction building addition.............       6,000,000
Navy 1994-1998:
    Pennsylvania--Philadelphia NS: Asbestos removal 
      facility..........................................       2,300,000
Air Force 1995-1999:
    Germany--Spangdahlem AB: Upgrade sewage and storm 
      water system......................................       2,100,000
Defense-wide 1996-2000:
    Program Re-estimate.................................       7,000,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
        Total...........................................     $22,428,000

      Hurricane Bertha.--The conferees are aware that military 
family housing units sustained significant damage from 
Hurricane Bertha on July 12, 1996. The conferees will consider 
any reprogramming that may be submitted for repair of these 
family housing units.
      Historic Preservation.--In addition to the directives 
contained in Senate Report 104-287, the conferees direct the 
Department to consult with the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation and other relevant organizations with preservation 
expertise in developing this report.

      California--Fort Irwin: Land Acquisition.--The conferees 
recognize that the Army must acquire additional territory 
adjacent to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, 
California, in order to maintain the excellence of training 
operations at this unique installation. Recent information has 
shown that environmental mitigation could be performed to 
permit expansion to the south of the National Training Center, 
long considered to be the most militarily advantageous option. 
Therefore, the conferees direct the Army to analyze expansion 
to the south, to update its cost analysis and economic study of 
acquiring property to the south, and to report its findings to 
the Committees on Appropriations no later than March 15, 1997.

Senate.

the Senate which would rescind $6,900,000 in funds appropriated

at the end of this report.
Amendment No. 11
      Earmarks $50,687,000 for study, planning, design,

Senate.
Amendment No. 12
      Inserts a provision proposed by the Senate which would

available.
Amendment No. 15

instead of $17,139,000 as proposed by the Senate.

conferees note that permanent law provides ``appropriations 
shall be applied only to the objects for which the 
appropriations were made . . .'' (31 U.S.C. 1301(a)). The 
fiscal year 1995 Military Construction Appropriations Act 
(Public Law 103-307) included $7,200,000 for an Army Aviation 
Support Facility at Mobile, Alabama, and these funds are 
available only for that purpose. The conferees encourage the 
Army National Guard to explore any cost savings option(s) 
available in providing this facility, including the acquisition 
of an existing facility, if one is available which can be 
acquired and converted for less cost to the federal government 
than the construction of a new facility.
