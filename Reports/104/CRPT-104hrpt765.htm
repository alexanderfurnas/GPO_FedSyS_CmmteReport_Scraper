SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

  This Act may be cited as the ``Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure 
Development Trust Fund Act of 1996''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

  (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
          (1) the Congress approved the Pick-Sloan Missouri River basin 
        program by passing the Act of December 22, 1944, commonly known 
        as the ``Flood Control Act of 1944'' (58 Stat. 887, chapter 
        665; 33 U.S.C. 701-1 et seq.)--
                  (A) to promote the general economic development of 
                the United States;
                  (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa;
                  (C) to protect urban and rural areas from devastating 
                floods of the Missouri River; and
                  (D) for other purposes;
          (2) the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects are major 
        components of the Pick-Sloan program, and contribute to the 
        national economy by generating a substantial amount of 
        hydropower and impounding a substantial quantity of water;
          (3) the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects overlie the 
        western boundary of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation, having 
        inundated the fertile, wooded bottom lands of the Tribe along 
        the Missouri River that constituted the most productive 
        agricultural and pastoral lands of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe 
        and the homeland of the members of the Tribe;
          (4) Public Law 85-916 (72 Stat. 1766 et seq.) authorized the 
        acquisition of 9,418 acres of Indian land on the Crow Creek 
        Indian Reservation for the Fort Randall project and Public Law 
        87-735 (76 Stat. 704 et seq.) authorized the acquisition of 
        6,179 acres of Indian land on Crow Creek for the Big Bend 
        project;
          (5) Public Law 87-735 (76 Stat. 704 et seq.) provided for the 
        mitigation of the effects of the Fort Randall and Big Bend 
        projects on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation, by directing the 
        Secretary of the Army to--
                  (A) replace, relocate, or reconstruct--
                          (i) any existing essential governmental and 
                        agency facilities on the reservation, including 
                        schools, hospitals, offices of the Public 
                        Health Service and the Bureau of Indian 
                        Affairs, service buildings, and employee 
                        quarters; and
                          (ii) roads, bridges, and incidental matters 
                        or facilities in connection with such 
                        facilities;
                  (B) provide for a townsite adequate for 50 homes, 
                including streets and utilities (including water, 
                sewage, and electricity), taking into account the 
                reasonable future growth of the townsite; and
                  (C) provide for a community center containing space 
                and facilities for community gatherings, tribal 
                offices, tribal council chamber, offices of the Bureau 
                of Indian Affairs, offices and quarters of the Public 
                Health Service, and a combination gymnasium and 
                auditorium;
          (6) the requirements under Public Law 87-735 (76 Stat. 704 et 
        seq.) with respect to the mitigation of the effects of the Fort 
        Randall and Big Bend projects on the Crow Creek Indian 
        Reservation have not been fulfilled;
          (7) although the national economy has benefited from the Fort 
        Randall and Big Bend projects, the economy on the Crow Creek 
        Indian Reservation remains underdeveloped, in part as a 
        consequence of the failure of the Federal Government to fulfill 
        the obligations of the Federal Government under the laws 
        referred to in paragraph (4);
          (8) the economic and social development and cultural 
        preservation of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe will be enhanced by 
        increased tribal participation in the benefits of the Fort 
        Randall and Big Bend components of the Pick-Sloan program; and
          (9) the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe is entitled to additional 
        benefits of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River basin program.

  Amend the title so as to read:

    A bill to provide for certain benefits of the Pick-Sloan 
Missouri River basin program to the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, and 
for other purposes.

                          PURPOSE OF THE BILL

    The purpose of H.R. 2512 is to provide for certain benefits 
of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River basin program to the Crow 
Creek Sioux Tribe.

                  BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

    H.R. 2512, the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure 
Development Trust Fund Act of 1996, would establish for the 
benefit of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe a $27.5 million fund, 
using receipts from the programs of the Eastern Division of the 
Pick-Sloan Missouri River basin program.
    When Congress enacted the Pick-Sloan Missouri River basin 
program in 1944, it authorized two projects, the Fort Randall 
and Big Bend projects, which overlie the western boundary of 
the Crow Creek Indian Reservation. These projects have 
inundated the bottom lands of that Tribe along the Missouri 
River.
    Public Law 85-916 authorized the acquisition of 9,418 acres 
of Indian land on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation for the 
Fort Randall project and Public Law 87-735 authorized the 
acquisition of 6,179 acres of land on the Crow Creek Indian 
Reservation for the Big Ben project. Public Law 87-735 also 
provided for the mitigation of the effects of the Fort Randall 
and Big Bend projects on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation by 
directing the Secretary of the Army to replace, relocate, or 
reconstruct existing essential government and agency facilities 
on the reservation, provide for a township adequate for 50 
homes and utilities, and provide for various tribal facilities.
     Because the Federal Government has failed to meet the 
mitigating requirements of P.L. 87-735, H.R. 2512 provides that 
the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe is entitled to additional benefits 
of the Pick-Sloan Missouri River basin program, including 
hydropower revenues and infrastructure development.
     H.R. 2512 would establish in the Treasury of the United 
States, a $27.5 million Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure 
Development Trust Fund. This Fund would be financed, starting 
with fiscal year 1997, by the Secretary of the Treasury 
depositing in the Fund a portion of revenues from receipts from 
the programs of the Eastern Division of the Pick-Sloan Missouri 
River basin program. Beginning with the fiscal year after the 
Fund reaches the $27.5 million level, and for each fiscal year 
thereafter, all interest amounts transferred out of the Fund 
and into that separate account will be available without fiscal 
year limitation to the Secretary of the Interior for use 
pursuant to a Plan developed by the Tribe.

                            COMMITTEE ACTION

     H.R. 2512 was introduced on October 19, 1995, by 
Congressman Tim Johnson (D-SD). The bill was referred to the 
Committee on Resources, and within the Committee jointly to the 
Subcommittees on Native American and Insular Affairs and Water 
and Power Resources. On April 25, 1996, the Subcommittee on 
Native American and Insular Affairs held a joint hearing with 
the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on H.R. 2512, where the 
Department of the Interior generally supported the bill and 
indicated that it views some provisions of H.R. 2512 as an 
implementation tool through which the Tribe may finally realize 
the mandate expressed by Congress in the Big Bend Act of 1962. 
The Department of the Army deferred to the Department of the 
Interior for the Administration's position on the bills. On 
August 1, 1996, the Full Resources Committee met to consider 
H.R. 2512. The two subcommittees were discharged from further 
consideration of the bill. An amendment in the nature of a 
substitute was offered by Congressman Johnson and adopted by 
voice vote. The bill as amended was then ordered favorably 
reported to the House of Representatives.

            COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and clause 
2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
the Committee on Resources' oversight findings and 
recommendations are reflected in the body of this report.

                     INFLATIONARY IMPACT STATEMENT

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that the 
enactment of H.R. 2512 will have no significant inflationary 
impact on prices and costs in the operation of the national 
economy.

                        COST OF THE LEGISLATION

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires an estimate and a comparison by the 
Committee of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out 
H.R. 2512. However, clause 7(d) of that rule provides that this 
requirement does not apply when the Committee has included in 
its report a timely submitted cost estimate of the bill 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                     COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XI

2512 does not contain any new budget authority, credit 
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax 
expenditures. The bill would increase direct spending authority 
by approximately $1.4 million per year beginning in 1998, for a 
total outlay of $4 million.

               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                   Washington, DC, August 16, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2512, the Crow 
Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund Act of 
1996.
    Enacting H.R. 2512 would affect direct spending. Therefore, 
pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).
    Enclosure.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: H.R. 2512.
    2. Bill title: Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure 
Development Trust Fund Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Resources on August 1, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: H.R. 2512 would provide for compensation 
to the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe for the taking of tribal lands 
for the site of the Fort Randall and Big Bend dam projects. The 
bill would establish an economic recovery fund for the tribe 
and make interest earned by the fund available to the tribe for 
education, health, maintenance of water systems, and other 
purposes.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates 
that enacting H.R. 2512 would create new direct spending 
authority of about $1.4 million each year, beginning in fiscal 
year 1998. We estimate that the resulting outlays would total 
about $4 million over the 1997-2002 period, as shown in the 
following table.

                                    [By fiscal years, in millions of dollars]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The costs of this bill fall within budget function 450.
    6. Basis of estimate: H.R. 2512 would establish a Crow 
Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund, into 
which would be deposited an amount equal to 25 percent of the 
previous year's receipts from the power program of the Pick-
Sloan Missouri River basin program, with a cap of no more than 
$27.5 million. Since the power program's receipts for fiscal 
year 1996 are estimated to be greater than $200 million, CBO 
expects that the fund would be fully capitalized in fiscal year 
1997. This transfer would be intragovernmental and there would 
be no outlays associated with such principal deposits.
    The bill would direct that the principal be invested in 
interest-bearing Treasury obligations. The interest would be 
transferred to another account, which the tribe would be able 
to use for various purposes. H.R. 2512 states that the interest 
would be made available to the Secretary of the Interior to 
transfer to the tribe the year after the Infrastructure 
Development Trust Fund is fully funded. Assuming a transfer to 
the fund early in fiscal year 1997, CBO estimates that interest 
earnings of about $1.4 million would be made available to the 
tribe in fiscal year 1998 and in each subsequent year. These 
amounts would be available for spending without appropriations 
action. Estimated outlays of this interest by the tribe are 
based on historical spending rates for programs with similar 
goals and activities as those stated in the bill.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets 
up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct 
spending or receipts through 1998. CBO estimates that enacting 
H.R. 2512 would affect direct spending in the form of payments 
to the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe from the tribe's Infrastructure 
Development Trust Fund. Such payments would begin in fiscal 
year 1998, but we estimate that outlays would total less than 
$500,000 in that year. The following table summarizes the 
estimated pay-as-you-go impact of this bill.

    8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: H.R. 2512 contains no intergovernmental mandates 
as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public 
Law 104-4).
    Section 5 of the bill would require the Crow Creek Sioux 
Tribe to prepare a plan for using payments from the Federal 
Government authorized by section 4 as a condition of receiving 
those payments and would specify a number of elements to be 
included in the plan. Based on information provided by the 
tribe, CBO estimates that the cost of complying with this 
requirement would be about $500,000 over two years. The bill 
would not authorize any funds for preparing the plan, but the 
annual payments received from the Federal Government would be 
used by the tribe to carry out projects included in the plan.
    H.R. 2512 would impose no other costs on state, local, or 
tribal governments.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would 
impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: On August 9, 1996, CBO prepared 
a cost estimate for S. 1264 for the Senate Committee on Indian 
Affairs. The bills are identical, as are the cost estimates.
    11. Estimate prepared by: Federal cost estimate: Lisa Daley 
and Rachel Robertson. Impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: Marjorie Miller. Impact on the private sector: Amy 
Downs.
    12. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant 
Director for Budget Analysis.

                    COMPLIANCE WITH PUBLIC LAW 104-4

    H.R. 2512 contains no unfunded mandates as defined in 
Public Law 104-4.

                        CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW

    If enacted, H.R. 2512 would make no changes in existing 
law.
