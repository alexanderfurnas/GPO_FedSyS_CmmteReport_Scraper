  Mr. Murkowski, from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, 
                        submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 1786]

    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, to which was 
referred the Act (H.R. 1786) to regulate fishing in certain 
waters of Alaska, having considered the same, reports favorably 
thereon without amendment and recommends that the Act do pass.

                         purpose of the measure

    The purpose of H.R. 1786 is to regulate fishing in certain 
waters in Alaska.

                          background and need

    The ancestors of local residents who reside within the 
boundaries of the Katmai National Park have participated in the 
annual harvest of red fish from August to early October every 
year. When the Katmai National Park was designated a park in 
the 1930's, the local residents were prohibited from the taking 
of red fish except with a rod and reel.
    This bill is the result of the work of the Alaska 
Federation of Natives, the Bristol Bay Native Association and 
the Department of the Interior, and would reinstate the taking 
of red fish for local residents by traditional means during the 
months of August through October.

                          legislative history

    H.R. 1786 was introduced by Congressman Young on June 8, 
1995. The House Resources Committee held a hearing on May 19, 
1996. On June 26, 1996 the bill was reported out of Committee 
and on July 18, 1996 it was reported to the House and placed on 
the calendar. Under suspension of the rules H.R. 1786 was 
passed by voice vote on July 30, 1996. The legislation was 
received in the Senate on July 31, 1996, read twice and 
referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
    At the business meeting on September 12, 1996, the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources ordered H.R. 1786, 
favorably reported.

           committee recommendations and tabulation of votes

    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in open 
business session on September 12, 1996, by unanimous consent of 
a quorum present, recommends that the Senate pass H.R. 1786, as 
described herein.

                      section-by-section analysis

Section 1--Descendants' land use

    Section 1 defines the Katmai National Park and red fish.

Section 2--Effect on title and jurisdiction of tidal and submerged 
        lands

    Section 2 addresses the effect of title and jurisdiction of 
tidal and submerged lands within the Katmai National Park.

                   cost and budgetary considerations

    The following estimate of the cost of this measure has been 
provided by the Congressional Budget Office.

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 13, 1996.
Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 1786, an act to regulate fishing in certain 
waters of Alaska, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources on September 12, 1996. We 
estimate that implementing this legislation would have no 
significant impact on the federal budget. H.R. 1786 would not 
affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go 
procedures would not apply.
    H.R. 1786 would allow certain Alaskan natives who live 
within the boundaries of the Katmai National Park to catch red 
fish (spawned-out sockeye salmon) on park property. Based on 
information provided by the National Park Service, we estimate 
that the agency's cost to promulgate and enforce any necessary 
fishing regulations would not be significant.
    H.R. 1786 contains no private-sector or intergovernmental 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local, 
or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Deborah Reis.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).

                      Regulatory Impact Evaluation

    In compliance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee makes the following 
evaluation of the regulatory impact which would be incurred in 
carrying out H.R. 1786. The Act is not a regulatory measure in 
the sense of imposing Government-established standards or 
significant economic responsibilities on private individuals 
and businesses.
    No personal information would be collected in administering 
the program. Therefore, there would be no impact on personal 
privacy.
    Little, if any, additional paperwork would result from the 
enactment of H.R. 1786, as ordered reported.

                        Executive Communications

    The Committee did not request any departmental reports or 
executive communications on H.R. 1786.

                        Changes In Existing Law

    In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee notes that no 
changes in existing law are made by the Act, H.R. 1786, as 
ordered reported.
