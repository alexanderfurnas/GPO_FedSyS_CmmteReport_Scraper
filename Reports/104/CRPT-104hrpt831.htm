an employee under such system shall receive 5 additional years of 
service for each such rating.

        rating at the lowest of those ratings;

prior to the date of issuance of reduction-in-force notices, or the 4-
year period prior to the agency-established cutoff date for ratings 
permitted in subsection (b)(2) of this section, shall be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (2).

performance ratings of record required under this section shall--

  (b) Equitable Treatment of Employees.--For purposes of determining 
the order of retention of employees in a reduction in force taking 
effect on or after October 1, 1999, the Office of Personnel Management 
shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to ensure that--
          (1) in the case of any agency having more than 1 performance 
        evaluation system, employees subject to different systems are 
        treated equitably; and
          (2) with respect to employees in the same competitive area 
        who have been subject to different performance evaluation 
        systems with dissimilar summary levels, no such employee shall 
        suffer as a result of having been covered by more than 1 such 
        system.
  (c) Report.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the General Accounting Office shall submit to the 
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate 
a report analyzing and assessing the following:
          (1) Based on performance-ratings statistics in the executive 
        branch of the Government over the past 15 years, the 
        correlation (if any) between employees' ratings of record and

                of unfair labor practices.
                  (H) Appeals of adverse actions.
          (2) The impact of performance ratings on retention during 
        reductions in force over the past 5 years.
          (3) Whether ``pass/fail'' performance systems are compatible 
        with the statutory requirement that efficiency or performance 
        ratings be given due effect during reductions in force.
          (4) The respective numbers of Federal agencies, 
        organizational units, and Federal employees that are covered by 
        the different performance evaluation systems.
          (5) The potential impact of this section on employees in 
        different performance evaluation systems.
          (6) Whether there are significant differences in the 
        distribution of ratings among or within agencies and, if so, 
        the reasons therefor.
Based on the findings of the General Accounting Office, the report 
shall include recommendations to improve the effectiveness of Federal 
performance evaluation systems.
  (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall apply 
with respect to reductions in force taking effect on or after October

                made in such benefits to reflect the withholdings 
                that--

                        withholdings under subparagraph (A)) by reason

individual, subject to subsection (d).

                      Short Summary of Legislation

     H.R. 3841, the Omnibus Civil Service Reform Act of 1996, 
revises the Executive Branch's ability to conduct demonstration 
projects under Chapter 47 of Title 5, U.S. Code, and enhances 
the role of performance management in several employee 
evaluation activities. The bill expands the array of benefits 
available under the Thrift Savings Plan, including enabling new 
employees to begin contributing to their retirement accounts 
when they enter the workforce, allowing entering employees to 
roll their individual 401(k) retirement accounts into their 
Thrift Savings Plan accounts, and liberalizing the terms under 
which employees can borrow or withdraw their contributions.
     The bill also authorizes agencies to exercise additional 
flexibility in reducing their workforces by allowing employees 
to volunteer for RIFs and by authorizing employees to enter 
into nonreimbursable details as a means of demonstrating their 
skills for potential new employers. The bill creates a variety 
of ``soft-landing'' options to ease the transition between 
federal and private sector employment. These include allowing 
employees to continue their Federal Employees Group Life 
Insurance coverage by paying the premiums after leaving federal 
service, extending for up to eighteen months the period during 
which agencies may continue to pay the employer share of 
premium in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and 
creating a combination of within-agency priority placement 
programs, education, retraining, and relocation assistance 
programs that will ease post-federal employment transitions.
     The bill enables agencies to reimburse federal employees 
for the costs of certain forms of liability insurance, 
authorizes disbarment of health care providers who have 
committed fraud against the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Program, and will ensure that FBI personnel have access to the 
same Merit System Protection Board personnel appeals system as 
other federal employees.

               I. Background and Need for the Legislation

     Laws governing the federal civil service have not had a 
major revision since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. 
Federal human resources management policies were a prime target 
of the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, 
and the Administration proposed a ``Federal Human Resources 
Management Reinvention Act of 1995'' to address deficiencies 
that were identified in agencies' examination of human resource 
laws and regulations. The Civil Service Subcommittee conducted 
nearly twenty hearings throughout 1995 and the beginning of 
1996, into various aspects of federal human resource management 
policies. The Subcommittee identified a number of problem areas 
in need of reform.

                       a. demonstration projects

     One leading element of the Administration's proposal was a 
broad capacity to expand current provisions of Chapter 47 of 
Title 5, U.S. Code. These provisions restrict demonstration 
projects to a total of ten government wide, require that 
demonstration projects cover no more than 5,000 people, impose 
extensive approval processes and reporting on the agencies 
conducting them, but do not provide for effective evaluation 
and resolution of demonstration projects. As a result, OPM 
reported at the Subcommittee's July 16 hearing that only one 
demonstration project is in progress, but the agency 
anticipates that several more could be approved quickly under 
more workable provisions of law.
     While the Civil Service Subcommittee initiated this review 
of federal law, the Congress authorized the Federal Aviation 
Administration to establish an alternative personnel management 
system (in the Transportation Appropriations Bill for FY-1996), 
and authorized the Department of Defense to conduct a 
demonstration project with its acquisitions workforce. That 
provision of the Department of Defense Authorization Act of 
1995 enabled the Department to exceed the 5,000 employee 
ceiling established for demonstration projects in Title 5, U.S. 
Code. Neither of these activities would count within the 10 
project limit in Chapter 47 because they are authorized by 
separate legislation. The Congress encountered human resources 
management problems in issues related to workforce reductions 
at the National Security Agency, during deliberations related 
to proposals to eliminate Cabinet Departments and other 
agencies, and in the course of other efforts to consolidate 
functions currently performed in different agencies. At several 
hearings, the Civil Service Subcommittee heard witnesses 
emphasize the importance of flexibility for managers who would 
have to exercise responsibility for reducing agency staff. 
These factors all contributed to the Subcommittee's desire to 
provide legislation to resolve some of the crucial issues 
facing the federal workforce.

                   B. Performance and Accountability

    The Subcommittee's initial hearings (October 12, 13, and 
25, 1995) provided opportunities for the Administration, 
employee organizations, officials from previous 
administrations, scholars, and other organizations to describe 
the deficiencies of current personnel management systems. 
Witnesses agreed that agencies faced different issues as a 
result of efforts to reduce the size and scope of government 
than they had experienced in recruiting, hiring, training, 
promoting, and retaining personnel for large agencies. When new 
technologies were introduced, and required changes in 
employees' skills, or when functions were changed in agencies, 
agencies often could not adapt to new requirements. OPM 
authorized agencies to institute new personnel evaluation and 
rating systems, including options for ``pass/fail'' systems, 
and many agencies appeared eager to move toward less rigorous 
evaluation procedures. Mrs. Morella, during hearings, expressed 
strong reservations about ``pass/fail'' ratings, and several 
witnesses agreed that such systems worked contrary to efforts 
to improve links between performance and accountability. With 
the repeal of the Performance Management and Recognition System 
in 1993 agencies encounter growing challenges rewarding those 
who excel and achieving accountability for failures of 
government operations.

               C. Enhancement of the Thrift Savings Plan

    The Subcommittee's hearings identified that the key 
obstacles to providing employees the flexibility needed to move 
between positions in the private sector and public service 
center on the portability of benefits. Employees are less 
likely to move between positions if they fear that they would 
lose pension rights, insurance benefits, access to and coverage 
for health care needs, or other concerns. Several Members 
introduced legislation to ease transitions, with many of the 
proposals initially centered upon the Department of Defense 
base closures, but with the concerns shared widely among 
Members and affected organizations.
    One critical factor in increasing the portability of 
retirement funds is the ability of employees to control funds 
that are contributed toward retirement accounts. Since its 
introduction in 1986, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) component 
of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) has increased 
participation among federal employees and gained market 
confidence to the extent that its three investment options now 
contain more than $30 billion in assets. Mrs. Morella 
introduced a bill to increase the investment options available 
under the Thrift Savings Plan. As a result of borrowing 
problems identified during the government shutdowns of November 
and December, 1995, the Subcommittee added provisions that 
would reduce restrictions on employees either borrowing from or 
withdrawing savings that they had deposited into TSP accounts. 
The Subcommittee also addressed portability concerns by 
including provisions that would enable employees entering 
federal service to deposit funds into TSP accounts that had 
accumulated in 401(k) plans or other private retirement 
accounts.

                     D. Reorganization Flexibility

    During the Subcommittee's May 23, 1996, hearing, the 
General Accounting Office testified that it had incorporated 
provisions into its new reduction-in-force regulations that 
allowed employees to volunteer for a RIF if that might serve 
the agency's requirements for staff reduction. The Subcommittee 
had previously approved similar voluntary RIF provisions in FY 
1996 authorizing legislation for the Department of Defense. By 
allowing employees not otherwise affected by a RIF to volunteer 
the jobs of non-retirement eligible employees can be spared.
    The Subcommittee also concluded that greater flexibility to 
detail employees to other agencies might be used to facilitate 
the exchange of personnel within government. Current law 
permits temporary assignments of employees between agencies 
only when the receiving agency assumes payroll costs. By the 
elimination of the requirement for reimbursement donor agencies 
could facilitate the placement of their surplus employees on a 
trial in other agencies.

                            E. Soft Landings

    In addition to pension portability, several other concerns 
dominate the attention of federal employees who face potential 
loss of positions during downsizing. Options for continuation 
of life and health insurance, measures that would strengthen 
the portability of pensions, and assistance with costs 
associated with education, professional training, or relocation 
were combined into legislation introduced by Mr. Wolf and co-
sponsored by several other Members. H.R. 2751, as introduced, 
gained considerable support, and was endorsed broadly by 
several Members at a hearing conducted May 8, 1996.
    The bill would provide federal employees the ability to 
continue life insurance coverage after separation from service 
by paying premiums. It would authorize agencies to continue 
payment of the government's portion of health insurance 
premiums for as long as eighteen months after separation. Under 
this authority, federal agencies would be required to establish 
internal priority placement programs, and could provide 
employees with outplacement counseling services. The bill also 
contains incentives that would enable agencies to reimbursement 
for the costs associated with retraining, additional education, 
or relocation associated with taking a position outside of 
federal service.

                          F. Other Provisions

    The Subcommittee included in this bill provisions that can 
address a series of proposed improvements in federal human 
resources management practices. The Senior Executives 
Association recommended that agencies be authorized to purchase 
liability insurance for federal employees who might be subject 
to litigation for actions undertaken in the course of official 
duties, but whose agencies might be unwilling to provide full 
defense counsel for them.
    When activities performed by federal agencies are converted 
to contract under OMB Circular A-76, affected employees are 
granted a ``right of first refusal'' to positions with the 
contractor. This provision is currently adopted only in 
Executive Order, and the Subcommittee believes that it would 
provide additional employment security to employees who might 
be affected by contracting of commercial activities now 
performed by government agencies.
    The bill also carries a number of additional provisions 
which address some long standing civil service problems and 
amendments of a technical nature. These include debarment of 
health care providers found to have engaged infraudulent 
practices, conversion of certain positions in the United States 
Fire Administration, and establishment of mandatory alternative 
dispute resolution (ADR) procedures. The ADR provisions are 
intended to address the growing disenchantment with the current 
appeals mechanism in the federal workplace.
    The National Performance Review had called attention to the 
need for a review of the appeals process and the Treasury 
Postal Appropriations Subcommittee of the House had charged OMB 
with the preparation of a report to the Congress on this 
matter. The Senior Executive Association testified at Civil 
Service Subcommittee hearings that managers believe that the 
current appeals system does not deter disgruntled employees 
from filing false or frivolous claims, causing many managers to 
hesitate to deal with problem performers. GAO testified that 
the average time between filing a complaint with the employing 
agency and an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decision 
averages more than 800 days. Federal employees also file 
workplace discrimination complaints at six times the rate of 
private sector employees. Between 1991 and 1994, the number of 
discrimination complaints filed has risen substantially, to the 
extent that the inventory of appeals to EEOC of agencies'' 
final decisions has tripled. During 1994, MSPB decided 2,000 
``mixed cases,'' (that is, cases involving claims of 
discrimination as well as some other prohibited personnel 
practice). It found discrimination in only eight of them. 
Employees who are dissatisfied with an MSPB decision on a 
discrimination claim can file with the EEOC. GAO reports that 
EEOC disagreed with the MSPB in only three out of 200 cases 
that were appealed during 1994, and that MSPB accommodated its 
findings to the EEOC position in those cases.
    Provisions to streamline the employee appeals process had 
been included in this bill in an attempt to alleviate some of 
the burdens in the current system. At the request of the 
minority, the Subcommittee agreed to remove the proposed 
remedies pending further discussions and considerations. 
Provisions to encourage greater use of alternative dispute 
resolutions were substituted instead.

             II. Legislative Hearings and Committee Actions

    H.R. 3841 was introduced by Civil Service Subcommittee 
Chairman John L. Mica (for himself, Mr. Moran, and Mrs. 
Morella) on July 17, 1996, and referred to the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight. The bill combined provisions 
that had previously been introduced as H.R. 2082, H.R. 2306, 
H.R. 2683, H.R. 2688, H.R. 2751, H.R. 2825, H.R. 2858, H.R. 
3129, H.R. 3483, H.R. 3574, S. 1488, and H.R. 3649. The Civil 
Service Subcommittee conducted a hearing on the bill on July 
16, 1996. The bill was marked-up in the Civil Service 
Subcommittee on July 18, 1996, where Subcommittee Chairman Mica 
presented the bill.
    One amendment was offered by Mr. Moran and agreed to 
without objection. This amendment struck Section II of H.R. 
3841, which would have streamlined the appeals process 
available to federal employees. The Subcommittee agreed to 
continue discussions on this topic to develop acceptable 
language for an amendment which would be included later in the 
legislative process.
    The Government Reform and Oversight Committee met on July 
25, 1996 to consider H.R. 3841. Civil Service Subcommittee 
Chairman presented an amendment in the nature of a substitute 
to H.R. 3841, reflecting the Subcommittee amendment. Mr. Moran 
offered three amendments, en bloc, which were agreed to without 
objection. The first amendment directs the General Accounting 
Office to conduct a study and submit a report to the Committee 
on Government Reform and Oversight. The report would analyze 
the relationship of performance rating systems and several 
designated personnel actions. The second amendment requires 
federal agencies to establish alternative dispute resolution 
procedures that would precede formal appeals procedures through 
the Merit Systems Protection Board and/or the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission. The third amendment struck section 604 
of the bill, which would have extended to certain employees of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation appeal rights before the 
Merit Systems Protection Board that are available to employees 
of other agencies. Mrs. Morella offered an amendment, which was 
agreed to without objection, to require the Office of Personnel 
Management to ensure that employees rated under different 
performance evaluation systems are treated equitably in the 
event of a reduction in force. The bill, as amended, was 
favorably reported to the House unanimously by voice vote and 
without further amendment by the full Committee.

             III. Committee Hearings and Written Testimony

    The Civil Service Subcommittee began a series of hearings 
specifically addressing civil service reform proposals on 
October 12 and 13, 1995. The National Performance Review's 
review of federal human resources policies concluded, ``The 
federal human resource administrative system contains major 
impediments to efficient and effective management of the 
workforce.'' Chairman Mica observed, ``We must redirect 
government agencies to address changing priorities as we head 
into the Twenty-First Century. American business and industry 
have undergone dramatic changes in the past decade. Now, our 
federal government and civil service system must also respond 
to changing times.''
    Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director James B. King 
described a system whose major strength is that it protects 
merit principles and advances the interests of the nation's 
veterans, but does so through systems that are too rigid and 
complex, causing agencies to focus on process rather than 
results. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Deputy Director 
for Management John Koskinen described changes in the 
professional qualifications desired of many federal managers, a 
contrast with the skills sought a generation ago. The 
Administration desired greater flexibility in managing their 
personnel while adhering to merit system principles. Deputy 
Secretary Mortimer Downey of the Department of Transportation 
contended that current civil service laws and procedures do not 
support efforts to develop high-performance units that reward 
knowledge, judgment, teamwork, and problem solving in response 
to rapidly changing forces. He claimed that the system 
encourages hierarchy at the expense of accountability. The 
Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) is promoting some 
changes, but more will be needed to hire and develop an 
effective future workforce. Dr. Walter Broadnax, Deputy 
Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, 
focussed upon the classification and compensation issues. In 
response to Chairman Mica's question, both Deputy Secretaries 
agreed on the desirability for more flexible methods of 
addressing problems of poor performance.
    Panelists agreed that the current system to remove poor 
performers is something that managers will only use once. 
Director King observed that, in a reduction-in-force (RIF) 
situation, employees having ``bumping'' rights might not be 
suited to the lower-level positions that they could occupy 
after a RIF. In effect, current supervisors could be impaired 
by their ineffective management of the performance rating 
system. In response to questions from Mrs. Morella, both Deputy 
Secretaries admitted that their agencies are moving in the 
direction of ``pass/fail'' appraisal systems, broadly linked to 
organizational goals.
    Mr. L. Nye Stevens, the General Accounting Office's 
Director of Federal Workforce and Management Issues, observed 
that although there is broad agreement about the principles 
underlying the National Performance Review's sense of 
direction, he has not discerned much legislative support for 
specific measures to implement them. Former OPM Director 
Constance Horner stressed the importance of linking future 
performance ratings to objective measures, as contemplated by 
the Government Performance and Results Act.
    The Civil Service Subcommittee conducted a hearing on 
performance management in the federal workforce on October 26, 
1995. Chairman Mica observed that federal agencies appear to 
have difficulties managing people, and that the major reform 
initiatives envisioned in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 
have not improved the performance and accountability of federal 
agencies. OPM data report that 99.6 percent of federal 
employees are rated ``fully successful'' or better, with 73 
percent rated ``exceeds fully successful'' or ``outstanding.'' 
Nonetheless, data provided by the Merit Systems Protection 
Board (MSPB) showed that 78 percent of federal managers believe 
that they have supervised employees defined as ``poor 
performers,'' and they lack confidence that the government's 
human resource management tools are adequate to address 
problems related to poor performance. Thus, only 23 percent of 
these managers initiated measures to demote or terminate 
problem employees.
    Mrs. Morella commented that she had reservations about 
moving toward ``pass/fail'' performance evaluation systems, and 
that previous hearings left her with the impression that 
federal managers were more interested in managerial flexibility 
than the related accountability. Effective performance rating 
systems should probably include methods of weighting the 
multiple factors involved in evaluation.
    Ms. Sandra O'Neil of the Society for Human Resource 
Management, indicated that a three-point scale can be 
sufficient to identify superior and ineffective employees while 
minimizing the inclination to inflate ratings that is involved 
in more differentiated systems. Dr. Joyce Shields, of Hay 
Management Consultants, Inc., stressed that evaluation systems 
should be linked to superior performance, and include 
incentives for improvement. Effective organizations frequently 
obtain 360-degree feedback, with sources including peers, 
supervisors, subordinates, customers, and self-evaluations. 
Line management is held accountable, and good systems are 
designed to increase employees'' skills. Performance management 
needs selective reinvention to support the government's budget-
balancing efforts. Dr. Shields observed that effective measures 
to address poor performance begin on the front end--emphasizing 
the high expectations of excellent performers--but must include 
top-down willingness to impose sanctions on poor management.
    Mr. Frank Cipolla, of the National Academy of Public 
Administration, observed that a performance management system 
requires a link between individuals and the organization's 
performance. Performance issues are addressed best by designing 
workflow, according to intended outcomes that are defined 
early. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 
provides a vehicle to implement these procedures in federal 
agencies. He observed that the multiple appellate systems 
affecting federal agencies need to be streamlined. Even 
streamlining, however, will not make the system effective 
unless managers are willing to use available accountability 
mechanisms. Any comprehensive civil service reform would have 
to incorporate rethinking of career and tenure-based employment 
principles. Although concerns about performance have been 
central to previous civil service reforms, we still don't have 
a system that works well. He emphasized the need for rethinking 
of the classification system. The panel agreed that the private 
sector shares many of the government's human resource 
management problems in the area of performance assessment.
    On November 29, 1996 the Civil Service Subcommittee held a 
hearing to identify the issues attendant with streamlining the 
appeals procedures for federal employees. Evangeline Swift, 
Director of Policy and Evaluation at the Merit Systems 
Protection Board (MSPB), reported that the agency received 
8,775 appeals in 1994, of which only 204 were appeals of 
performance-based actions under Chapter 43. Of the 224 appeals 
heard by the Board that year, 109 involved affirmative defenses 
alleging discrimination. MSPB conducted a survey of 5,700 
federal managers, and many of the respondents believe that, if 
they took action, management would not support them if 
challenged. They also reported that they frequently received 
inconsistent and contradictory guidance from agency experts on 
the procedures. Despite the sentiments reflected in the survey, 
Ms. Swift observed that most terminations are unchallenged, and 
when they are challenged, management is upheld in the vast 
majority of cases.
    Mr. G. Jerry Shaw, executive director of the Senior 
Executive Association, argued that to take an action against a 
poorly performing employee is to invite a plethora of attacks 
by the employee on the manager. The Senior Executives 
Association surveyed its members, and found numerous reports of 
``frequent filers,'' many of them filing frivolous complaints 
in a multitude of forums. Agencies are widely believed to be 
willing to settle rather than contest the claims, especially in 
light of the diversion of time and effort involved in 
addressing them. The plethora of frivolous complaints clogging 
the system appear to have crowded out legitimate complaints 
that don't get filed because of the delays involved.
    Mr. Robert E. Tobias, National President of the National 
Treasury Employees Union, asserted that current federal 
procedures are easier and the burden of proof is less 
burdensome than private organizations. He contended that the 
current failure is a failure to engage the perceived poor 
performer and provide support, assistance, and training. If 77 
percent of managers with problem employees took no action, that 
is not a system failure. Nonetheless, the widespread perception 
of systemic flaws demands a response, and Mr. Tobias would 
substitute an arbitration system, fashioned through collective 
bargaining, as a one-stop alternative to the current system. 
Mr. Shaw also contended that the Civil Service Reform Act's use 
of ``substantial'' evidence, rather than a ``preponderance'' 
has appropriately reduced what had been an excessive burden of 
proof on agencies.
    On May 8, 1996, the Civil Service Subcommittee conducted a 
hearing on legislation addressing issues related to federal 
workforce reductions and proposed measures to provide soft 
landings for affected federal employees. H.R. 2751, a proposal 
introduced by Mr. Wolf and several colleagues to provide 
separation incentive payments, retraining, relocation, and 
educational assistance, and to continue health and life 
insurance coverage for separated employees consolidated several 
measures addressing related issues. Delegate Norton proposed 
the creation of both government-wide and agency priority 
placement systems for federal employees who might be separated 
during workforce reductions. Mrs. Morella recommended H.R. 2825 
to provide additional re-employment training opportunities for 
federal employees. Several members recommended measures to 
waive requirements that employees who retire before qualifying 
for full annuities receive pensions that are reduced 
commensurate with their lower age at separation.
    The Civil Service Subcommittee continued its oversight of 
the Administration's workforce reduction efforts at a hearing 
on May 23, 1996. This hearing demonstrated that the 
Administration spent more than $2.8 billion providing voluntary 
separation incentive payments (buyouts) to federal employees 
without achieving the restructuring goals targeted by the 
National Performance Review. Mr. Timothy P. Bowling, Associate 
Director of the General Accounting Office for Federal Workforce 
Management Issues testified that the Administration is ahead of 
the workforce reduction goals established by the Federal 
Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-226), but added 
that nearly all federal workforce reductions in 1997 will focus 
on the Department of Defense; non-defense agencies are slated 
to increase employment by 2,000 positions. The managerial 
functions that were targeted by NPR, however, have not been 
reduced consistent with those recommendations. Indeed, in some 
cases, those functions have increased as a portion of the 
federal workforce.
    Mr. John A. Koskinen, OMB's Deputy Director for Management, 
testified that ``budgetary resources are not expected to be 
available to the agencies to meet the salary and other costs of 
a workforce that is any larger'' than provided under the 
Federal Workforce Restructuring Act. Both Koskinen and OPM 
Director King recommended the Administration's approach to 
adjusting civil service laws to manage workforce reductions 
more effectively than possible under current provisions. G. 
Jerry Shaw, General Counsel of the Senior Executive 
Association, remarked that the current efforts to reduce the 
federal workforce is having a major impact on middle managers 
and professionals that differs from previous workforce 
reductions, and he recommended that the Subcommittee consider 
the different retraining requirements that derive from these 
differences.
    The General Accounting Office also reported to the 
Subcommittee on its revision of RIF regulations and recommended 
the inclusion of authority to volunteer for RIFs.
    On July 16, 1996, the Civil Service Subcommittee invited 
several witnesses to provide comments on draft provisions under 
consideration for inclusion in the bill. The Office of 
Personnel Management remained supportive of the 
Administration's recommendations, and advised that it would 
have no problems implementing the measures contemplated. Roger 
W. Mehle testified that the Federal Retirement Thrift 
Investment Board, which governs the Thrift Savings Plan, was 
receptive to the additional options being provided for federal 
employees'' investments. The Board advised that provisions 
eliminating restrictions on employees ability to borrow or 
withdraw their TSP contributions could result in administrative 
savings.

            IV. Explanation of the Bill--Section by Section

Section 1. Short title and table of contents.

    This section provides a short title for the bill, the 
``Omnibus Civil Service Act of 1996,'' and a table of contents.

                    TITLE I--DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

Section 101. Demonstration projects

    This section provides increased authority and streamlined 
procedures for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and 
other agencies to conduct demonstration projects. It permits 
agencies to develop demonstration projects on their own 
initiative and submit them to OPM for approval. Under this 
section, government corporations may participate in 
demonstration projects. This section also amends current law to 
permit the waiver of laws relating to leave other than Family 
and Medical Leave and to prohibit the waiver of subchapters II 
and III of chapter 73 of title 5, United States Code.
    This section establishes new limits on the time and scope 
of demonstration projects, increases the number of projects 
permitted, and lifts the current cap on the number of employees 
who may be covered. Demonstration projects may last for a 
maximum of 5 years. However, they may be continued beyond that 
date for a maximum of 2 years to the extent necessary to 
validate the results. The limit on the number of demonstration 
projects that may be in effect at any one time is increased 
from 10 to 15, not more than 5 of which may involve more than 
5,000 employees each (exclusive of employees in control 
groups).
    OPM may require the agency conducting a demonstration 
project to also perform the mandatory evaluation of the results 
of the project and its impact on public management.
    This section also requires OPM to take any corrective 
action within its authority if it determines that the 
termination of a demonstration project would create inequities 
for participating employees. If legislation is necessary to 
correct the inequity, OPM is required to submit an appropriate 
legislative proposal to Congress. OPM is also required to 
submit an appropriate legislative proposal to Congress if it 
determines that a demonstration project should be made 
permanent.

              TITLE II--PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENT

Section 201. Increased weight given to performance management for 
        retention in a RIF

    This section puts increased emphasis upon performance in 
determining who is retained during a reduction in force (RIF). 
It builds upon and modifies OPM's current regulatory scheme for 
weighing performance in RIFs. Under this section, employees 
will be credited with additional years of service based upon 
the sum of their three most recent performance ratings (or 
assumed ratings) in the four years preceding the RIF or the 
agency-established cutoff date. Employees will earn five years 
of additional service for each rating of fully successful or 
equivalent (Level 3), 7 years for each rating of exceeds fully 
successful or equivalent (Level 4), or 10 years for each rating 
of outstanding or equivalent (Level 5).
    This section also establishes rules for crediting years of 
service when an agency uses a pass/fail appraisal system, a 
two-level system, and one with three or more levels to measure 
performance at the level of fully successful or better. 
Employees earn 5 years of additional service for each ``pass'' 
rating. In a two-level system, they earn 5 years for the lower 
rating, and 7 for the higher. When an agency uses three or more 
levels, employees earn 5 years for the lowest rating, 7 for the 
next highest, and 10 for each higher rating.
    Employees who have not received one or more of the three 
actual performance ratings required will be credited with 5 
years of service for each missing rating.
    This section requires GAO to issue a report to the House 
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs analyzing a number of issues 
related to performance management, including the compatibility 
of ``pass/fail'' performance systems with the statutory 
requirement that efficiency or performance ratings be given 
``due effect'' during RIFs, and recommend improvements in the 
effectiveness of federal performance evaluation systems. The 
study is due within 270 days of the date of enactment.
     This section also requires OPM to issue regulations to 
ensure that in RIFs occurring on or October 1, 1999, employees 
are treated equitably when their agency has more than one 
performance evaluation system and that employees in the same 
competitive area are not adversely affected as a result of 
having been covered by different performance systems.
    The RIF rules established in this section will apply to 
RIFs taking effect on or after October 1, 1999.

Section 202. No appeal of denial of periodic step increases

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 5535 to eliminate appeals 
of denials of within-grade step increases to the Merit Systems 
Protection Board. Nothing in this section is intended to 
prohibit an employee from grieving the denial of a within-grade 
increase under any grievance procedure.
    The section also changes the standard for determining when 
an employee may receive a step increase from work at ``an 
acceptable level of competence'' to fully successful 
performance or better.

Section 203. Performance appraisals

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 302 to provide (1) that, 
in addition to reassignments, reductions in grade, and 
removals, agencies may take ``any other appropriate action'' 
against a poor performer and (2) that an employee must be 
afforded an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance 
before the agency proposes to demote or remove the employee for 
unacceptable performance. The employee is not entitled to 
another opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance if 
the employee's performance is again determined to be 
unacceptable.
    This section shall take effect 180 days after the date of 
enactment, but shall not apply to any proposed action as to 
which the employee has received advance written notice in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. Sec. 4303(b)(1)(A) before the 
effective date.

Section 204. Amendments to incentive awards authority

    This section amends the definitions in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 4501 
to eliminate all references to the government of the District 
of Columbia. It also amends section 4503 to permit cash awards 
to groups based upon a suggestion, invention, superior 
accomplishment, act, service, or other meritorious act of a 
group of employees collectively. A group award is permissible 
when, for example, it is infeasible to determine the relative 
role or contribution of each individual member of the group. 
Each member's award may not exceed the limits established in 
section 4502, and the awards to members of the group must be 
equal. However, awards may be prorated to reflect differences 
in the period of time during which an individual was a member 
of the group.

Section 205. Due process rights of managers under negotiated grievance 
        procedures

    In order to protect the due process rights of managers and 
supervisors, this section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7121 to 
eliminate the requirement that arbitrators'' have the authority 
to require agencies to discipline an individual in a case 
involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice. This 
section takes effect on the date of enactment and applies with 
respect to orders issued on or after that date notwithstanding 
the provisions of any collective bargaining agreement.

Section 206. Collection and reporting of training information

    This section requires OPM to collect information concerning 
training programs, plans, and methods utilized by federal 
agencies and submit an annual report to Congress. OPM may also 
collect information on nongovernmental training to the extent 
it considers appropriate in the public interest. On request, 
OPM may make such information available to an agency and to 
Congress.

    TITLE III--ENHANCEMENT OF THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN AND CERTAIN OTHER 
                                BENEFITS

  Subtitle A. Additional Investment Funds for the Thrift Savings plan

Section 301. Short title

    The short title for this subtitle is the ``Thrift Savings 
Investment Funds Act of 1996.''

Section 302. Additional investment funds for the thrift savings plan

    This section makes changes to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8438 which are 
necessary to authorize the addition of the two new investment 
funds. The language is similar to that in section 8438 with 
respect to the Common Stock Index Investment Fund (C Fund), to 
which the two new funds bear the greatest resemblance. Like 
that fund, the two new funds are required to be index funds 
which invest in indices that represent certain defined sectors 
in the equity markets.
    Section 302 makes changes necessary to add the two new 
funds to the list of those the Federal Retirement Thrift 
Investment Board is authorized to establish by subsection 
(b)(1) of section 8438. This is consistent with the statutory 
treatment of the current investment funds. The Board is given 
the responsibility to choose indices and establish investment 
funds that fall within the parameters for each fund as set 
forth in the statute.
    The section also adds two new paragraphs to section 8438(b) 
which describe the parameters of the two new investment funds. 
New paragraph (3) of section 8438(b) describes the requirements 
for the Small Capitalization Stock Index Investment Fund. The 
Board must choose a commonly recognized index that represents 
the market value of the United States equity markets, but 
excluding that portion of the equity markets represented by the 
common stocks included in the C Fund. It is intended therefore, 
that the Small Capitalization Stock Index Fund will be designed 
to replicate the performance of an index representing smaller 
capitalization stocks not held in the C Fund.
    New paragraph (4) describes the requirements for the 
International Stock Index Investment Fund. The Board must 
choose a commonly recognized index that is a reasonably 
complete representation of the international equity markets. 
The term ``international equity markets'' excludes the United 
States equity markets, which are represented by the other 
funds.

Section 303. Acknowledgment of investment risk

    Section 303 amends section 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8439(d), to add a 
reference to the two new investment funds in the section 
requiring each Thrift Savings Plan TSP participant who invests 
in one of the enumerated funds sign an acknowledgment stating 
that he understands that the investment is made at the 
participant's own risk, that the government will not protect 
the participant against any loss on such investment, and that a 
return on the investment is not guaranteed by the government. 
As is the case with the C Fund and the Fixed Income Investment 
Fund, Small Capitalization Stock Index Fund and the 
International Stock Index Fund each carry the risk that an 
investment may lose value. Therefore, it is appropriate to 
require the participant to sign the same acknowledgment of risk 
statement prior to investing in either of these funds.

Section 304. Effective date

    This subtitle will take effect on the date of enactment, 
and the two new funds it establishes will be offered for 
investment at the earliest practicable election period as 
determined by the Executive Director of the Federal Retirement 
Thrift Investment Board.

              Subtitle B. Thrift Savings Account Liquidity

    Subtitle B improves the liquidity of TSP accounts during 
employment and gives federal employees greater flexibility with 
their account upon separation. The amendment gives the 
Executive Director discretion to determine which accounts are 
so small that they should automatically be paid out upon 
separation. Finally, the proposed legislation would eliminate 
any need for and the existence of deferred TSP benefits, 
eliminating the current requirement that participants make an 
election as to how they wish to receive their account earlier 
than is required for all other retirement accounts under the 
Internal Revenue Code. Funds will simply remain on account 
until payment is requested by a participant (or beneficiary) 
required by law, or ordered by a court.

Section 311. Short title

    The short title for this subtitle is the ``Thrift Savings 
Plan Act of 1996.''

Section 312. Notice to spouses for in-service withdrawals; de minimis 
        accounts; Civil Service Retirement System participants

    Section 312(l)(A) eliminates provisions allowing for a 
modification of the date of a withdrawal election after 
separation. Under this subtitle, elections for deferred 
payments are rendered unnecessary and eliminated. Consequently, 
the need to be able to modify the date of an election is no 
longer necessary. Funds will simply remain on account to be 
paid promptly upon request or to satisfy court-ordered or age-
related payment requirements.
    This section includes technical amendments expanding the 
notice available to spouses of CSRS employees to apply to the 
new in-service withdrawals in the same manner it currently 
applies to loans.
    Subsection (2)(A) would eliminate the requirement that the 
Executive Director automatically pay, upon separation, a non-
forfeitable account balance of $3,500 or less where a CSRS 
employee fails to make a valid withdrawal election. This change 
would permit the Executive Director to determine a de minimis 
amount below which the account will automatically be disbursed.

Section 313. In-service withdrawals; de minimis Accounts; Civil Service 
        Retirement System participants

    Section 313 allows TSP participants additional access to 
their TSP accounts at separation by permitting more than one 
type of withdrawal election and prior to separation by adding 
two in-service withdrawal features. Access to TSP funds upon 
separation is currently limited to one of three options; the 
legislation would permit mixed withdrawal elections. Similarly, 
access to TSP funds before separation is currently limited by 
law to loans. Such loans are further limited by the requirement 
that they be approved only for the specific purposes enumerated 
in the statute. The legislation would remove these purpose 
tests. Further, it eliminates elections for deferred withdrawal 
payments.
    This section would eliminate the present statutory 
restriction which permits participants to select only one 
method of withdrawal payment upon separation. Subsection (a) 
would allow the Executive Director to offer, by regulation, a 
separated employee the opportunity to select one or more of the 
presently approved withdrawal options. It would add the option 
to a separated employee to make a one-time withdrawal or 
transfer of any or all of an account in addition to the options 
provided in subsection (a).
    Subsection (a)(3) would eliminate the requirement that the 
Executive Director automatically pay, upon separation, a 
nonforfeitable account balance of $3,500 or less, as was done 
for CSRS employees in section 1(c).
    Subsection (a)(3) would also change the date by which a 
separated participant must make a withdrawal election. 
Employees who separate from service have a number of withdrawal 
options. Currently, the statute provides that the TSP must 
purchase an annuity if the participant has not made a valid 
withdrawal election by February 1 of the year following the 
latest of (1) the year in which the participant turns age 65, 
(2) the tenth anniversary of the year in which the employee 
became subject to the provisions of FERSA, or (3) the 
employee's separation from service. Because the ten-year 
anniversary of the Plan occurs in 1997, this provision would 
first take effect next year.
    The purpose of the current provision is not clear, but it 
may already have caused many participants to become confused 
regarding TSP withdrawals. The change made by this subsection 
will eliminate this arbitrary deadline and simply require that 
annuity payments be made by April 1 of the year following the 
later of the year in which the employee turns age 70\1/2\ or 
the employee's separation from service, unless a withdrawal 
election is made before that time.
    Subsection (a)(5) simplifies and expands the current TSP 
loan program by eliminating the present ``purpose'' 
restrictions on loans. Currently, loan applicants must show 
that they qualify for a loan under one of four purposes 
enumerated in the law. The proposed change would remove this 
restriction and authorize certain withdrawals.
    Subsection (a)(6) would allow employees the option to 
withdraw all or a portion of their vested funds prior to 
separation provided they have attained age 59\1/2\. Employees 
are generally considered to be of retirement age when they 
reach age 59\1/2\. Consequently, they are permitted to withdraw 
retirement funds without the early withdrawal penalty imposed 
on other in-service withdrawals by the Internal Revenue Code.
    Subsection (a)(6) would also allow participants of any age 
to withdraw their own contributions and associated earnings 
prior to separation if they are able to demonstrate a financial 
hardship. Such a withdrawal is a taxable distribution subject 
to an early withdrawal penalty under the Internal Revenue Code 
for those persons under age 59\1/2\. Thus, such withdrawals are 
clearly discouraged but would not be prohibited where there is 
a clear and demonstrable need.
    Subsection (b) would invalidate elections with deferred 
payment dates that have not been executed once participants are 
eligible to submit an election at any time for immediate 
payment.

Section 314. Survivor annuities for former spouses; notice to Federal 
        employees retirement system spouses for in-service withdrawals

    Section 314 contains technical amendments eliminating 
references to changes of a withdrawal election and expanding 
the notice and consent portions of the statute available to 
spouses of FERS employees to apply to the new in-service 
withdrawals in the same manner they currently apply to loans.

Section 315. De minimis accounts relating to the judiciary

    Section 315 would eliminate the requirement that the 
Executive Director automatically pay, upon separation, a 
nonforfeitable account balance of $3,500 or less where FERS 
employees who are justices or judges as defined by section 451 
of title 28, bankruptcy judges and magistrates, or Court of 
Federal Claims judges, fail to make a valid withdrawal 
election, as was done for CSRS and other FERS employees.

Section 316. Definition of basic pay

    Eliminating the special definition of basic pay would have 
the effect of applying to the TSP the same basic pay 
calculation that applies to amounts contributed to the FERS and 
CSRS defined benefit programs. The current definition of basic 
pay for TSP purposes found at 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341 authorizes the 
use of the ``uncapped'' rate of pay as it relates to Federal 
Wage System employees. This unique definition has caused 
unnecessary confusion and errors in calculations by employing 
agencies. Each year since 1988 Congress has approved 
legislative language requiring that the actual rate of basic 
pay be substituted for the special definition. The elimination 
of the special definition of basic pay for TSP purposes makes 
this change permanent.

Section 317. Eligible rollover distributions

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8432 to permit employees 
and members to transfer to the TSP his or her account balance 
from a plan qualified under section 401(a) or 408(b) of the 
Internal Revenue Code or an Individual Retirement Arrangement 
(IRA) qualified under sections 408(a) or 408(b) to the TSP. 
Such transfers are not permitted under current law. It is not 
clear why Congress did not permit such rollovers. Perhaps 
Congress wanted to insulate the TSP from defects which may be 
found in other qualified plans. For example, prior to 1992 it 
was unclear whether the joint and survivor annuity rules would 
apply to a transfer of funds from a transferror plan. Recent 
changes in the tax law, i.e, the Unemployment Compensation Act 
of 1992, Pub. L. 102-318, 106 Stat. 290 (1992), and final 
regulations issued by the IRS interpreting it, have clarified 
the rules applicable to transfers and rollovers. Under those 
regulations, the TSP will not be subject to rules which are 
applicable to the transferror plan or IRA. It now appears that 
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (and IRS 
regulations) encourage the type of transaction contemplated by 
this section.

Section 318. Effective date

    This subtitle shall take effect on the date of enactment. 
Changes in the withdrawals, loans, rollovers, and elections as 
provided under the amendments made by this subtitle will be 
made at the earliest practicable date as determined by the 
Executive Director.

    Subtitle C. Other Provisions Relating to the Thrift Savings Plan

Section 321. Percentage limitation on contributions

    Under current law, those who participate in the TSP may not 
contribute more than a fixed percentage of their basic pay. The 
caps are either 10% or 5%, depending upon their positions or 
whether they are in the FERS or CSRS retirement plans. This 
section eliminates those caps, which would permit individuals 
to contribute up to the limit established by the Internal 
Revenue Service. This section shall take effect 6 months after 
enactment or at such earlier date the Executive Director may 
prescribe by regulation.

Section 322. Loans under the thrift savings plan for furloughed 
        employees.

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8433(g) to provide that 
an employee who has been furloughed due to a lapse in 
appropriations may not be denied a loan from the TSP solely 
because he or she is not in a pay status.

Section 323. Immediate participation in the thrift savings plan

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8432 (b) to eliminate 
statutorily required waiting periods before employees and 
Members may contribute to the TSP. Under this section, such 
individuals shall be eligible to contribute on the day they 
begin service or, if that is not administratively feasible, on 
the earliest date thereafter that the Executive Director 
determines to be feasible.

Subtitle D. Resumption of Certain Survivor Annuities That Terminated by 
                           Reason of Marriage

Section 331. Resumption of certain survivor annuities that terminated 
        by reason of marriage

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8341(e) and 8443(b) 
to provide for the reinstatement the survivors annuity of a 
child that is terminated by reason of marriage if that marriage 
ends by death of the spouse, divorce, or annulment. The annuity 
is to resume on the first day of the month in which the 
marriage ends if (1) the individual repays any lump sum paid 
and (2) the individual is not otherwise ineligible for such 
annuity.
    This section also amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8908 that a child 
whose survivor annuity is terminated by reason of marriage and 
then restored may enroll in a health benefits plan under 
sections 8903 or 8903a if such individual was covered by such a 
plan immediately before the annuity was terminated.
    The amendments made by this section shall apply to any 
termination of marriage taking effect before, on, or after the 
date of enactment. However, no annuities shall be payable 
retroactively.

                  Subtitle E. Life Insurance Benefits

Section 341. Domestic relations orders

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8705 to provide that 
death benefits payable under a group life or group accidental 
death insurance policy in effect on the date of an employee's 
death shall be subject to a court decree of divorce, annulment, 
or legal separation, or the terms or any court order or court-
approved property settlement agreement incident to a decree of 
divorce, annulment, or legal separation. The decree, order, or 
agreement shall not be effective unless it is received before 
the date of the employee's death by the employing agency or, if 
the employee has separated from service, by OPM. A designation 
under such a decree, order, or agreement may not be changed 
unless written consent of the designee or a modification of the 
decree, order, or agreement is received before the date of the 
employee's death by the employing agency or, if the employee 
has separated from service, by OPM. OPM shall issue regulations 
to implement this section, including regulations governing the 
receipt of 2 or more decrees, orders, or agreements with 
respect to the same amount.
    This section also amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8706 to provide that 
a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or 
the terms of a court-approved property settlement agreement 
incidental to such decree may direct an employee or former 
employee to make an irrevocable assignment of such individual's 
insurance policy to a person specified in the court order or 
court- approved settlement agreement.

Section 342. Exception from provisions requiring reduction in 
        additional optional life insurance

    Under existing law, employees who retires on an immediate 
annuity or who become entitled to workers' compensation under 
subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5 may continue to purchase 
additional optional life insurance. But the amount of that 
insurance is reduced 2% per month at the beginning of the 
second month following the employees 65th birthday. This 
section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8714b to eliminate that mandatory 
reduction if at the time of retirement a permanently disabled 
individual is designated to receive the entire amount of such 
insurance and the employee has made a timely election. However, 
the mandatory reduction shall nevertheless be made if: (1) the 
additional optional insurance is not paid to the individual 
designated at the time of retirement, (2) OPM finds that 
adequate arrangements have not been made to ensure that the 
insurance will be used only for the care and support of that 
individual, or (3) the election terminates at any time before 
the death of the insured individual.
    Whether an individual is permanently disabled shall be 
determined by regulations to be issued by OPM based upon 
subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 16414(a)(3) of the Social 
Security Act.
    The insured individual must also elect at the time and in 
the manner required by regulations issued by OPM to continue to 
have the full cost of the unreduced additional optional 
insurance withheld from such individual's annuity or 
compensation after reaching age 65. The election (and 
withholdings) shall terminate if the insured individual revokes 
the election or changes the beneficiary designated under 5 
U.S.C. Sec. 8705 at the time or retirement. It shall also 
terminate if OPM determines that any of the requirements or 
conditions for unreduced additional optional insurance are, at 
any time, no longer met.
    This section shall take effect on the date of enactment. 
OPM shall issue regulations under which individuals already 
separated from service may also elect unreduced additional 
optional insurance within 1 year after the date of enactment. 
Such an individual is eligible to make an election if the 
individual separated no more than 50 months before the date of 
enactment and would have been eligible to make an election on 
the date of separation (or, if earlier, the last day for making 
an election based upon that separation) if the amendments made 
by this section (and implementing regulations) had been in 
effect. If such individual makes an election, the appropriate 
amounts shall be withheld from the individual's annuity or 
compensation. If benefits are paid as a result of such election 
upon the death of the insured, the amount shall be reduced to 
reflect the additional amount that would have been withheld had 
the amendments made by this section (and implementing 
regulations) been in effect.
    OPM is required to notify current and former federal 
employees of the enactment of this section and any benefits for 
which they might be eligible under it by publication in the 
Federal Register and such other methods as OPM considers 
appropriate. The notification shall also describe the 
procedures for electing unreduced additional optional 
insurance.

                  TITLE IV--REORGANIZATION FLEXIBILITY

Section 401. Voluntary reductions in force

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(f) to provide 
additional flexibility to agencies undergoing a reduction in 
force. It grants to all agencies authority previously granted 
only to the Department of Defense to allow employees to 
volunteer to be separated rather than in a reduction in force. 
The agency may retain an individual in a similar position who 
would have been reached in the RIF. The separation of a 
volunteer shall be treated as involuntary for all purposes 
other than advance notice and participation in a priority 
placement program. An agency head may prohibit an individual 
with critical knowledge or skills from volunteering if the 
agency head determines that his or her separation would impair 
the performance of the agency's mission. The authority granted 
by this section may not be exercised after September 31, 2001.

Section 402. Nonreimbursable details to Federal agencies before a 
        reduction in force

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3341 to permit one agency 
to detail an employee who has received a specific RIF notice or 
who is likely to be separated in a RIF to another agency on a 
nonreimbursable basis. The detail may not exceed 90 days, and 
it may not be renewed. The purpose of this section is to allow 
an employee who is likely to be separated in a RIF to 
demonstrate the ability to perform another job. This section is 
effective 30 days after the date of enactment.

                    TITLE V--SOFT-LANDING PROVISIONS

Section 501. Temporary continuation of Federal employees' life 
        insurance

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8706 to permit employees 
who are separated due to a RIF or who voluntarily separate from 
a surplus position to continue their group life insurance for 
up to 18 months after the date of separation. The employee must 
pay both the employee's and agency's share of the premium and 
an amount not to exceed 2% to cover administrative expenses. 
This authority applies to separations occurring on or after the 
date of enactment but before October 1, 2001. However, with 
respect to an employee who has received a specific RIF notice 
before October 1, 2001, the authority extends to separations 
occurring before February 1, 2002.1

Section 502. Continued eligibility for health insurance

    This section amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8905 to allow certain 
employees who are separated in a RIF or who voluntarily 
separate from a surplus position to continue their health 
insurance under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. 
Subsection (a) applies to employees who retire on an immediate 
annuity based on such separations. It requires OPM to waive the 
requirement in section 8905(b) that the employee have been 
enrolled in an FEHBP plan for specific periods of time before 
retirement. Instead such employees will be eligible if they are 
enrolled in an FEHBP plan immediately before retirement. This 
authority applies to separations occurring on or after the date 
of enactment but before October 1, 2001. However, with respect 
to an employee who has received a specific RIF notice before 
October 1, 2001, the authority extends to separations occurring 
before February 1, 2002.
    Subsection (b) extends government wide a benefit previously 
available only to employees of the Department of Defense. Under 
it, an employee who is involuntarily separated due to a 
reduction in force or who voluntarily separates from a surplus 
position may elect to continue an FEHBP plan for a period of 18 
months after the date of the separation. The former employee is 
required to pay only the employee's share of the premium. The 
former employing agency pays the remainder.

Section 503. Priority placement programs for Federal employees affected 
        by a RIF

    This section adds a new section 3330a to title 5, United 
States Code, which requires agencies to establish agencywide 
priority placement programs within 3 months of the date of 
enactment. The priority placement programs shall facilitate 
employment placement for employees who are scheduled to be 
separated due to a RIF or who have been separated in a RIF. To 
participate in the program, an employee (other than one in a 
position excluded by law from a performance appraisal system) 
must have received a rating of fully successful (or equivalent) 
as their last rating of record. An individual loses eligibility 
for reemployment priority under this section if he or she 
requests removal in writing, accepts or declines a bona fide 
offer of employment (or fails to accept within the time 
permitted), or separates from the agency before being separated 
by the RIF.
    Agencies may not fill vacant positions from outside the 
agency if there is a qualified employee or former employee on 
the priority placement list, and they must apply veterans'' 
preference when placing employees who are on the list.

Section 504. Job placement and counseling services

    This section authorizes agencies to establish job placement 
and counseling services for current and former employees. These 
programs may include career and personal counseling, training 
in job search skills, and job placement assistance. Services 
authorized by this section may be provided to current employees 
of the agency or former employees who have been separated 
(other than for cause) for less than 1 year. An agency may also 
offer such services to current or former employees of another 
agency with the permission of that other agency. The costs of 
services provided to current or former employees of another 
agency shall be reimbursed by that agency.

Section 505. Education and retraining incentives

    This section authorizes agencies to pay retraining 
incentives, relocation incentives, and educational assistance 
on behalf of an individual who is involuntarily separated from 
a position, or an individual voluntarily separated from a 
surplus position, due to a reduction in force.
    An agency head may enter into an agreement with a non-
federal employer who agrees to employ an eligible employee for 
at least 12 months and to certify to the agency head any costs 
incurred by the employer in retraining such individual. The 
agency head shall pay a retraining incentive, in an amount 
prescribed by the agency head but in no event greater than the 
amount certified by the non-federal employer, upon the 
employee's completion of 12 months of continuous employment. 
The agency head shall pay a pro rated retraining incentive if 
the employee is employed by the non-federal employer for at 
least 6 months but less than 12.
    An agency head may also pay a relocation incentive to an 
eligible employee if it is necessary for the employee to 
relocate to begin employment with a non-federal employer. The 
amount of the relocation incentive is limited to the amount 
payable to relocate a federal employee who transfers between 
the same locations.
    Educational assistance may only be paid on behalf of full-
time permanent employees who have completed at least 3 years of 
current continuous service in any executive agency or agencies 
and been admitted to an institution of higher education within 
1 year after separation.
    The total amount spent on behalf of an individual under 
this section may not exceed $10,000. In addition, the amount of 
educational assistance available to employees is further 
limited to $8,000 if the employee has at least 4 but less than 
5 years of qualifying service and $6,000 if the employee has at 
least 3 but less than 4 years of qualifying service. (The term 
``qualifying service'' means service performed as an employee 
within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2105 on a permanent full-
time or permanent part-time basis. Part-time service shall be 
counted on a pro rated basis.) Retraining and relocation 
payments shall be paid from appropriations or other funds 
available to the agency for training. Educational assistance 
shall be paid from appropriations or other funds which would 
have been used to pay the employee's salary.
    Retraining and relocation incentives may not be paid for 
retraining or relocation commencing after June 30, 2002. 
Educational assistance may not be paid later than 10 years 
after the employee's separation.

                        TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS

Section 601. Reimbursements relating to professional liability 
        insurance

    This section authorizes an agency head to reimburse law 
enforcement officers, supervisors, managers, or any other 
employee the agency head considers appropriate, for up to 50% 
of the costs incurred by the employee for professional 
liability insurance. Reimbursements shall be paid from funds 
appropriated for the payment of salaries and expenses of 
government employees. Professional liability insurance subject 
to this section shall have policy limits of $1,000,000 per 
occurrence per year for legal liability and $100,000 for the 
cost of legal representation per occurrence per year.

Section 602. Employment rights following conversion to contract

    This section provides that contractors shall in good faith 
offer the right of first refusal of employment to qualified 
employees whose positions are abolished because an activity has 
been contracted out. However, the contractor is not required to 
make such an offer to an employee who, in the 12 months 
preceding the conversion, has been the subject of an adverse 
personnel action related to misconduct or received a less than 
fully successful performance rating. No employee shall have the 
right to more than 1 offer under this section based upon a 
particular separation due the contracting of an activity. The 
President shall issue regulations to carry out this section.

Section 603. Debarment of health care providers found to have engaged 
        in fraudulent practices

    Subsection (a) amends current Federal Employees Health 
Benefits (FEHB) law at 5 U.S.C. 8902a to remove unnecessary 
administrative constraints on, and otherwise improve, the 
Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) authority to bar FEHB 
Program participation by, and impose monetary penalties on, 
health care providers who engage in professional or financial 
misconduct. The proposal would make these FEHB provisions 
conform more closely with administrative sanctions authority 
for the Medicare Program (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7 and 1320a-7a), with 
regard to causes for imposing sanctions and the general 
availability of post-termination appellant rights, as was 
originally intended.
    The eight clauses in subsection (a) amend 5 U.S.C. 
Sec. 8902a--
          (1) in Sec. 8902a(a)(2)(A), to make a conforming 
        amendment;
          (2) in Sec. 8902a(b), to make OPM's authority to bar 
        providers convicted of criminal misconduct described in 
        (b)(1) through (4) mandatory, rather than permissive; 
        strike existing provisions in (b)(5), in order to move 
        the text to the new Sec. 8902a(c); and add a new 
        paragraph (b)(5) which reflects OPM responsibilities 
        for reciprocal debarments under the Governmentwide Non-
        procurement Debarment and Suspension Common Rule 
        authorized by Executive Order 12549 and OPM 
        implementing regulations issued May 17, 1993;
          (3) to redesignate Sec. 8902a(c) through (i), as (d) 
        through (j), and add a new Sec. 8902a(c) concerning 
        permissive authority for OPM to exclude providers from 
        FEHB participation; the new subsection (c) continues 
        discretion to impose programwide debarment on providers 
        subject to licensure restrictions in any state for 
        substantive misconduct, and adds provisions relating to 
        entities owned or controlled by an FEHB-sanctioned 
        provider, to providers who submit FEHB claims involving 
        excessive fees or inappropriate care, and to those 
        providers who engage in conduct that could be subject 
        to monetary penalties under subsection (d); this 
        subsection parallels Medicare sanction authority (42 
        U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)) and intends for OPM to consider the 
        seriousness of the conduct involved, nexus to FEHB 
        operations, and other mitigating circumstances, in 
        invoking this authority;
          (4) in Sec. 8902a(d)(1), as redesignated (relating to 
        OPM authority to impose civil monetary penalty, 
        assessment, and exclusion on providers) to more closely 
        parallel Medicare provisions for civil monetary 
        penalties; provisions now in clause (d)(1)(B) would be 
        moved to section 8902a(c)(3) (under section 2(3) of the 
        bill) because they relate to patterns of abuse for 
        which debarment is more appropriate; two new clauses 
        under (d)(1) would permit sanction of providers who 
        knowingly violate applicable Medicare charge 
        limitations under Sec. 8904(b) (for services provided 
        to retired FEHB enrollees age 65 or older who lack 
        Medicare part A or part B eligibility) or who continue 
        to submit claims under the FEHB Program while subject 
        to debarment;
          (5) in Sec. 8902a(f), as redesignated, to make a 
        conforming change in OPM authority for setting 
        conditions of debarment to reflect mandatory debarment 
        requirements under Sec. 8902a(g)(3);
          (6) in Sec. 8902a(g), as redesignated, to amend 
        paragraph (g)(1) concerning the effective date of 
        debarment, to specify that action to exclude a provider 
        from FEHB participation would generally be enforceable 
        after reasonable notice to affected parties, and would 
        confer a right for the provider to request a post-
        termination hearing as provided in Sec. 8902a(h)(1); 
        only in cases involving an adverse determination 
        relative to misconduct which warrants monetary 
        penalties under this section would the affected 
        provider receive written notice and an opportunity for 
        such determination to be made after a hearing under 
        Sec. 8902a(h)(1); these provisions parallel the 
        availability of appellant rights for excluded providers 
        under Medicare law [42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(f)]; in paragraph 
        (g)(3), to require a mandatory 3-year exclusion from 
        FEHB for providers convicted of a criminal offense 
        (unless OPM determines that special community needs 
        justify a shorter period);
          (7) in Sec. 8902a(h)(1), as redesignated, to strike 
        provisions which currently require that any adverse 
        determination under this section must be made on the 
        record after a formal evidentiary hearing, and instead 
        provide a basic right for adversely-affected parties to 
        request a hearing by a neutral hearing officer as 
        designated by OPM's Director, the timing of the hearing 
        to be determined under Sec. 8902a(g)(1) as amended; in 
        cases of mandatory debarments under subsection (b) 
        based on a criminal conviction or debarment by another 
        Government program for specified causes, due process 
        requirements would likely not require a further hearing 
        under this subsection; the nature of facts that could 
        be expected to be contested under appeals will 
        essentially involve review of documentary claims 
        evidence which will not be aided by formal, trial-like 
        hearing procedures and prompt removal of unfit 
        providers promotes FEHBP enrollee welfare and program 
        efficiency; this hearing format is consistent with OPM 
        practice with respect to withdrawal of approval of FEHB 
        plans under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8902(e) [5 CFR Sec. 890.204], 
        debarment actions under the Governmentwide Non-
        procurement Debarment and Suspension Common Rule [5 
        CFR, Part 970], and proposed regulations to establish 
        Governmentwide reciprocal effect across procurement and 
        Non-procurement programs for debarment and suspension 
        actions [59 FR 65607-25, Dec. 20, 1994]; 
        Sec. 8902a(h)(2) is also amended to provide for 
        judicial review in the district courts of the United 
        States due to the less formal administrative hearing 
        process under (h)(1); and
          (8) in Sec. 8902a(i), as redesignated, to add a 
        sentence to authorize withholding civil monetary 
        penalties and assessments which OPM imposes under this 
        section from any sum owed by the United States to the 
        sanctioned party, as permitted under Medicare law (42 
        U.S.C. 1320a-7a(f)).
    Except as provided below, the Act would be effective upon 
enactment:
          New permissive authority under subsection 8902a(c) 
        (2) and (4) for OPM to bar FEHB participation, in cases 
        of entities owned or controlled by FEHB-sanctioned 
        providers and in cases of providers who engage in 
        conduct that could be subject to monetary penalties 
        under subsection (d), would apply only to the extent 
        that misconduct which is the basis for debarment under 
        this subsection occurs after enactment of this Act.
          Also, civil monetary penalties and assessments under 
        subsection (d)(1)(B), for providers who violate 
        Medicare charge limitations for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 
        8904(b), would apply in cases involving FEHB services 
        furnished after enactment of this Act.
          Finally, the minimum 3-year mandatory debarment 
        specified by subsection 8902a(g)(3), as redesignated 
        and amended by this Act, would only apply to debarments 
        based on criminal convictions that occur after 
        enactment of this Act.

Section 604. Conversion of certain excepted service positions in the 
        United States Fire Administration to competitive service 
        positions

    This section requires the Director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and the Director of OPM to convert certain 
faculty positions at the National Academy of Fire Prevention 
and Control before the date of enactment of this act to a 
competitive service position without prejudice to the employees 
in those positions. This conversion shall take effect on the 
first pay period for such positions beginning after the date of 
enactment. It also amends 7(c)(4) of the Federal Fire 
Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 2206(c)(4)), 
effective on the date of enactment of this Act, to provide for 
appointments of faculty members to competitive service 
positions.

Section 605. Eligibility for certain survivor annuity benefits

    This section requires OPM to approve survivor annuity 
benefits for a former spouse under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341 who meets 
the 14 criteria enumerated in this section.

Section 606. Amendment to Public Law 104-134

    This section amends paragraph (3) of section 3110(b) of the 
Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 
(Public Law 104-134; 110 Stat. 1321-343) to require the United 
States Enrichment Corporation to make both the employee and 
agency contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund for those 
employees who elect to retain their coverage under the Civil 
Service Retirement System. This corrects an oversight in the 
Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act, which 
provided for such payments only on behalf of employees who 
retain their coverage under the Federal Employees' Retirement 
Service.

Section 607. Miscellaneous amendments relating to the health benefits 
        program for Federal employees

    Subsection (a) amends the definition of a carrier in the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to make clear 
that the government-wide Service Benefit Plan is sponsored by 
an association whose members are lawfully engaged in providing, 
paying for, or reimbursing the cost of group health plan 
functions and that the sponsor is the carrier.
    Subsection (b) adds language to clarify that the carrier 
for the government-wide Service Benefit Plan need not contract 
with underwriting affiliates licensed in all of the states and 
the District of Columbia. The carrier for this plan contracts 
with its local affiliates to underwrite the plan.
    Subsection (c) confirms the intent of Congress (1) that 
FEHBP contract terms which relate to the nature or extent of 
coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to 
benefits) completely displace state or local law relating to 
health insurance or plans and (2) that this preemption 
authority applies to FEHBP plan contract terms which relate to 
the provision of benefits or coverage, including managed care 
programs.

Section 608. Pay for certain positions formerly classified at GS-18

    This section provides that the rate of basic pay for 
positions classified at the GS-18 level on the date of 
enactment of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 
1990 shall be set and maintained at a rate equal to the highest 
rate of basic pay for the Senior Executive Service under 5 
U.S.C. Sec. 5382(b).

Section 609. Repeal of section 1307 of title 5, United States Code

    This section repeals an obsolete provision of title 5.

Section 610. Mandatory internal alternative dispute resolution 
        procedures

    This section authorizes federal agencies to develop 
mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedures covering 
certain employee complaints. The complaints covered are:
          any matter reviewable by the Office of Special 
        Counsel;
          any matter (other than retirement) appealable to the 
        Merit Systems Protection Board;
          and complaints of discrimination under--
                  section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
                  section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act 
                of 1938,
                  section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
                1973,
                  sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination 
                in Employment Act of 1967,
                  and rules, regulations, or policy directive 
                under these laws.
    The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, in 
conjunction with the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal Labor Relations 
Authority, the Office of Special Counsel, and the Office of 
Personnel Management, shall issue guidelines to assist agencies 
in developing such alternative dispute resolution procedures.

                       V. Compliance With Rule XI

    Pursuant to rule XI, clause 2(l)(3) of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, under the authority of rule X, clause 
2(b)(1) and clause 3(f), the results and findings from 
committee oversight activities are incorporated in the bill and 
this report.

                  VI. Budget Analysis and Projections

    Pursuant to the provisions of section 308(a) of the 
Congressional Budget Act, the enactment of H.R. 3841 is 
estimated to reduce revenues by approximately $1.6 billion over 
fiscal years 1997-2002, authorizes $2 million in new budget 
authority, and provides new spending authority of approximately 
$6 million.

                   VII. Estimated Cost of Legislation

    A copy of the cost estimate by the Congressional Budget 
Office follows:
                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.
Hon. William F. Clinger, Jr.,
Chairman, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3841, the Omnibus 
Civil Service Reform Act of 1996.
    Because enacting this legislation would affect both direct 
spending and receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                           June E. O'Neill,
                                                          Director.
    Enclosure.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: H.R. 3841.
    2. Bill title: The Omnibus Civil Service Reform Act of 
1996.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Government Reform and Oversight on July 25, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: H.R. 3841 would make many changes to laws 
that effect the hiring, retention, payment, and reduction in 
force of federal personnel, as well as the health, retirement, 
and life insurance benefits available to these employees.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Enacting H.R. 
3841 would affect revenues, direct spending, and spending that 
is subject to appropriations action. The bill's most 
significant budgetary effect would be the loss of certain 
income tax revenues. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) 
estimates that enacting this bill would decrease revenues by 
about $1.6 billion over the 1997-2002 period by allowing 
federal employees to increase the amount of their contributions 
to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and by allowing new employees 
to make contributions sooner. An increase in contributions 
would decrease revenues from federal income taxes because 
income used for such contributions is not taxed until it is 
withdrawn from the plan.
    CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3841 would increase direct 
spending by about $1 million each year over the 1997-2002 
period by allowing a child who is a survivor of a federal 
employee and whose marriage ends to reclaim benefits under the 
Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and Federal Employees' 
Retirement System (FERS), as long as that child is otherwise 
eligible under current law.
    Finally, the bill would increase discretionary costs, 
subject to the appropriation of necessary funds. CBO estimates 
that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) would incur costs of about $2 million 
in 1997 to devise regulations and report on the bill's 
provisions. Because several of the bill's provisions would 
provide optional authorities to agencies, and because we have 
no basis for estimating the extent that agencies would use such 
authorities, CBO cannot estimate the total increase in 
discretionary costs that would arise from enacting H.R. 3841.
    The following table summarizes the estimated impact of H.R. 
3841 on revenues and direct spending over the 1997-2002 period.

                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]

Note: Enacting H.R. 3841 also would increase spending subject to appropriation, but CBO cannot estimate the     
  extent of such effects.

                                Revenues

    Increase in the Limit on TSP Contributions.--The largest 
budgetary impact of this bill would stem from the provisions of 
Title III that would increase the maximum amount of money some 
federal employees could contribute to the TSP. Under current 
law, employees enrolled in FERS can contribute up to 10 percent 
of their salary to the TSP on a pre-tax basis, as long as that 
dollar amount is less than the IRS limit for 401(k) plans, 
which currently is $9,500 a year. The limit for employees 
enrolled in CSRS is 5 percent of salary. Section 321 would 
eliminate the 10 percent and 5 percent of salary restrictions 
and allow employees to contribute up to the IRS limit for 
401(k) plans, regardless of salary.
    Employee contributions to the TSP reduce an employee's 
taxable income. Therefore, this proposal would reduce federal 
revenue if people increase their contributions to the TSP. The 
Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the provision would 
result in a loss in revenue of $64 million in 1997 and $1.1 
billion over the 1997-2002 period.
    According to the General Accounting Office, about 800,000 
federal employees enrolled in FERS are eligible to contribute 
to the TSP. About 7 percent of the 800,000 employees contribute 
at the maximum rate of 10 percent. About 850,000 employees in 
CSRS are eligible to contribute to the TSP, and about 68 
percent of these employees contribute at the maximum rate of 5 
percent. JCT assumes that a majority of the employees in both 
FERS and CSRS who currently contribute at the maximum allowable 
level would increase their contributions by some amount.
    New Hires Allowed to Participate in TSP Sooner.--Section 
323 would allow new hires under FERS to contribute immediately 
to the TSP. Under current law, new employees must wait two open 
seasons until they can participate in the TSP. Under this 
proposal, the timing of the agency contributions would not 
change--agencies would still begin to make contributions to an 
employee's TSP after the employee waits two open seasons. JCT 
estimates that the federal government would forgo tax revenues 
of about $19 million in 1997 and $516 million over the 1997-
2002 period from enacting this provision. Data from OPM 
indicates that about 375,000 employees are hired each year who 
would become eligible to contribute immediately to the TSP. JCT 
assumes that the rate of participation for new employees would 
approximate the current rate of 77.2 percent for all federal 
employees, as reported by the Federal Retirement Thrift 
Investment Board. The slight increase in the amount of revenue 
loss for the years 2000 through 2002 reflects the net effect of 
rising employee salaries and declining federal employment.
    Other Provisions.--Section 205 would remove the authority 
under current law for arbitrators to impose a range of 
penalties on managers found in violation of prohibited 
personnel practices during binding arbitration. The 
disciplinary actions available to the arbitrator include the 
removal from employment, a reduction in grade, suspension, 
reprimand, or the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up 
to $1,000. Based on information provided by the Merit Systems 
Protection Board, civil monetary penalties, which are 
classified as revenues, have rarely been imposed in such cases. 
Consequently, CBO estimates that the repeal of this authority 
would have no significant effect on revenue.
    Section 302 would add two new investment funds to those 
currently offered by the Thrift Savings Fund: a small 
capitalization stock index fund and an international stock 
index fund. Further, the bill would provide current and former 
federal employees greater flexibility with their Thrift Savings 
Plan accounts and would expand the options for withdrawals. 
These provisions would make TSP more attractive to federal 
employees and would tend to increase participation in the plan. 
Increased participation in TSP would reduce federal income tax 
revenues, because federal employees contribute portions of 
their salaries to TSP on a pre-tax basis. On the other hand, 
the bill would increase tax revenues by accelerating taxable 
disbursements from TSP. CBO estimates that the bill would 
increase participation in TSP only modestly, and that the 
resulting effects on the federal budget would be small.

                            Direct spending

    Section 331 would restore child survivor benefits under 
CSRS and FERS for individuals whose marriage ends (whether by 
death of the spouse, divorce, or annulment), as long as that 
child survivor meets all current law criteria for benefits. 
Under current law, once a child survivor marries, benefits are 
permanently terminated even if the marriage ends.
    According to OPM, an average of about 110 child survivors 
lose benefits each year due to marriage. Based on data from the 
Bureau of the Census, CBO estimates that almost half of the 
roughly 400 child survivors who married before enactment of 
this bill and who otherwise still qualify for benefits have 
divorced. At an average benefit of about $4,800, the increase 
in direct spending would total about $1 million annually for 
the 1997-2002 period. The estimated cost remains roughly 
constant because in each year some of the divorced child 
survivors whose benefits are restored would become ineligible 
for benefits because they reach age 18 (or age 22 if they are 
in school) while newly divorced child survivors would have 
their benefits restored.
    Section 606 would allow certain former spouses of deceased 
annuitants to receive survivor benefits under CSRS. Although 
this proposal creates a new class of individuals who can be 
eligible for survivor benefits, the proposal requires that 14 
restrictive criteria be met in order to qualify. According to 
OPM, this proposal attempts to provide relief to one individual 
who has unsuccessfully appealed for survivor benefits through 
the OPM appeals process and the courts. Although it is possible 
that additional individuals may qualify for benefits under the 
criteria in this bill, CBO estimates the cost to the government 
would be insignificant.

                   Spending subject to appropriation

    H.R. 3841 also would increase discretionary costs, subject 
to the appropriation of necessary funds. For instance, CBO 
estimates that the bill would increase costs by about $2 
million dollars in 1997 for OPM and GAO to comply with the 
bill's requirements for reporting and regulations.
    The bill would require that all agencies establish a 
priority program for rehiring or reassigning employees who have 
been affected or are likely to be affected by a reduction in 
force (RIF). In such cases, the agency would be required to 
offer an eligible current or former employee any comparable 
vacancy located within the commuting area that is no more than 
three grade levels below the last position held by the 
employee. According to OPM, the average number of RIFs per year 
from 1993 through 1995 was about 6,750. Since OPM already 
requires that agencies have a placement program similar to that 
required by the bill, CBO estimates that any additional costs 
would not be significant.
    In addition, H.R. 3841 could increase costs if agencies 
elect to use several of the new authorities provided under the 
bill. For instance, the bill would allow agencies to enter into 
agreements with nonfederal employers whereby the agency agrees 
to pay the company a training payment not to exceed $10,000 if 
it employs a former worker in a compensated position for at 
least 12 months, and to reimburse employees for up to half the 
costs to carry certain professional liability coverage of as 
much as $1 million. Because we have no way of knowing to what 
extent agencies would offer such optional services to their 
employees, CBO cannot estimate the amount of additional costs 
that might arise.
    In the case of the training payment, the additional costs 
could be significant if an agency, such as the Internal Revenue 
Service or the Department of Defense, had a RIF of several 
thousand employees. For example, if the $10,000 maximum payment 
were made for 1,000 employees a year, the annual costs would be 
$10 million. However, the ability of an agency to offer this 
benefit to employees affected by a RIF would depend on the 
availability of appropriated funds. In the case of offering 
professional liability coverage, it is unlikely that any 
increase in costs would be significant. Based on information 
provided by OPM, CBO expects that the premium for an insurance 
policy of about $1 million would be between $200 and $300. 
Thus, an agency would incur a cost of between $100 and $150 for 
its share of the policy's cost. CBO does not expect that the 
number of policies under H.R. 3841 would be sufficient to 
result in a significant increase in costs.
    Finally, the bill includes several other provisions that 
could affect discretionary costs and might even result in 
savings. For instance, the bill's authority for agencies to 
adopt mandatory alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures 
could allow some agencies to streamline their existing process 
for settling certain complaints and grievances. Many executive 
branch agencies already utilize various methods of ADR. Data 
compiled by GAO indicates that the use of ADR tends to result 
in more efficient resolutions of disputes, although such 
conclusions are based mainly on anecdotal evidence. If greater 
use of ADR leads to more efficient dispute resolution, then 
agencies could realize some savings. However, CBO does not have 
sufficient information to estimate the likelihood or magnitude 
of such potential savings.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets 
up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct 
spending or receipts through 1998. CBO estimates that enacting 
H.R. 3841 would affect both direct spending and receipts. The 
estimated pay-as-you-go impact is summarized in the following 
table.

                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]

    8. Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal 
governments: H.R. 3841 contains no intergovernmental mandates 
as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public 
Law 104-4) and would have no impact on the budgets of state, 
local, or tribal governments.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: The bill would 
impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: None.
    11. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Wayne 
Boyington, for costs related to retirement and life insurance 
benefits and John R. Righter, for other costs; Impact on State, 
local, and tribal governments: Theresa Gullo; Impact on the 
private sector: Matthew Eyles.

Director for Budget Analysis.

                  VIII. Inflationary Impact Statement

    In accordance with rule XI, clause 2(l)(4) of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, this legislation is assessed to 
have no inflationary effect on prices and costs in the 
operation of the national economy.

Sec. 3330a. Priority placement programs for employees affected by a 
                    reduction in force

  (a) Not later than 3 months after the date of the enactment 
of this section, each Executive agency shall establish an 
agencywide priority placement program, to facilitate employment 
placement for employees who--
          (1) are scheduled to be separated from service due to 
        a reduction in force under--
                  (A) regulations prescribed under section 
                3502; or
                  (B) procedures established under section 
                3595;
          (2) are separated from service due to such a 
        reduction in force; or
          (3) have received a rating of at least fully 
        successful (or the equivalent) as the last performance 
        rating of record used for retention purposes (except 
        for employees in positions excluded from a performance 
        appraisal system by law, regulation, or administrative 
        action taken by the Office of Personnel Management).
  (b)(1) Each agencywide priority placement program under this 
section shall include provisions under which a vacant position 
shall not (except as provided in this subsection or any other 
statute providing the right of reemployment to any individual) 
be filled by the appointment or transfer of any individual from 
outside of that agency (other than an individual described in 
paragraph (2)) if--
          (A) there is then available any individual described 
        in paragraph (2) who is qualified for the position; and
          (B) the position--
                  (i) is at the same grade or pay level (or the 
                equivalent) or not more than 3 grades (or grade 
                intervals) below that of the position last held 
                by such individual before placement in the new 
                position;
                  (ii) is within the same commuting area as the 
                individual's last-held position (as referred to 
                in clause (i)) or residence; and
                  (iii) has the same type of work schedule 
                (whether full-time, part-time, or intermittent) 
                as the position last held by the individual.
  (2) For purposes of an agencywide priority placement program, 
an individual shall be considered to be described in this 
paragraph if such individual is--
          (A) an employee of such agency who is scheduled to be 
        separated, as described in subsection (a)(1); or
          (B) an individual who became a former employee of 
        such agency as a result of a separation, as described 
        in subsection (a)(2), excluding any individual who 
        separated voluntarily under section 3502(f).
  (c)(1) If after a reduction in force the agency has no 
positions of any type within the local commuting areas 
specified in this section, the individual may designate a 
different local commuting area where the agency has continuing 
positions in order to exercise reemployment rights under this 
section. An agency may determine that such designations are not 
in the interest of the Government for the purpose of paying 
relocation expenses under subchapter II of chapter 57.
  (2) At its option, an agency may administratively extend 
reemployment rights under this section to include other local 
commuting areas.
  (d)(1) In selecting employees for positions under this 
section, the agency shall place qualified present and former 
employees in retention order by veterans' preference subgroup 
and tenure group.
  (2) An agency may not pass over a qualified present or former 
employee to select an individual in a lower veterans' 
preference subgroup within the tenure group, or in a lower 
tenure group.
  (3) Within a subgroup, the agency may select a qualified 
present or former employee without regard to the individual's 
total creditable service.
  (e) An individual is eligible for reemployment priority under 
this section for 2 years from the effective date of the 
reduction in force from which the individual will be, or has 
been, separated under section 3502.
  (f) An individual loses eligibility for reemployment priority 
under this section when the individual--
          (1) requests removal in writing;
          (2) accepts or declines a bona fide offer under this 
        section or fails to accept such an offer within the 
        period of time allowed for such acceptance; or
          (3) separates from the agency before being separated 
        under section 3502.
A present or former employee who declines a position with a 
representative rate (or equivalent) that is less than the rate 
of the position from which the individual was separated under 
section 3502 retains eligibility for positions with a higher 
representative rate up to the rate of the individual's last 
position.
  (g) Whenever more than one individual is qualified for a 
position under this section, the agency shall select the most 
highly qualified individual, subject to subsection (d).
  (h) The Office of Personnel Management shall issue 
regulations to implement this section.

  (a) An employee paid on an annual basis, and occupying a 
permanent position within the scope of the General Schedule, 
who has not reached the maximum rate of pay for the grade in 
which his position is placed, shall be advanced in pay 
successively to the next higher rate within the grade at the 
beginning of the next pay period following the completion of--
          (1) each 52 calendar weeks of service in pay rates 1, 
        2, and 3;
          (2) each 104 calendar weeks of service in pay rates 
        4, 5, and 6; or
          (3) each 156 calendar weeks of service in pay rates 
        7, 8, and 9;
subject to the following conditions:
          (A) the employee did not receive an equivalent 
        increase in pay from any cause during that period; and
          (B) the [work of the employee is of an acceptable 
        level of competence] performance of the employee is at 
        least fully successful as determined by the head of the 
        agency.
          * * * * * * *
  (c) When a determination is made under subsection (a) of this 
section that the [work of an employee is not of an acceptable 
level of competence,] performance of an employee is not at 
least fully successful, the employee is entitled to prompt 
written notice of that determination and an opportunity for 
reconsideration of the determination within his agency under 
uniform procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel 
Management. [If the determination is affirmed on 
reconsideration, the employee is entitled to appeal to the 
Merit Systems Protection Board.] If the reconsideration [or 
appeal] results in a reversal of the earlier determination, the 
new determination supersedes the earlier determination and is 
deemed to have been made as of the date of the earlier 
determination. The authority of the Office to prescribe 
procedures [and the entitlement of the employee to appeal to 
the Board do not apply] does not apply to a determination of 
[acceptable level of competence] fully successful work 
performance made by the Librarian of Congress.
          * * * * * * *
  (g) For purposes of this section, the term ``fully 
successful'' denotes work performance that satisfies the

of Federal Regulations (as deemed to be amended by section 
3502(g)(2)(B)).

beyond the date which is 18 months after the effective date of 
the separation which entitles a former employee to coverage 
under this subsection. Termination of continued coverage under 
this subsection shall be subject to provision for temporary 
extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an 
individual policy of life insurance as provided by subsection 
(a). If an eligible employee does not make an election for 
purposes of this subsection, the employee's insurance will 
terminate as provided by subsection (a).
  (3)(A) This subsection shall apply to an employee who, on or 
after the date of enactment of this subsection and before the 
applicable date under subparagraph (B)--
          (i) is involuntarily separated from a position due to 
        a reduction in force, or separates voluntarily from a 
        position the employing agency determines is a ``surplus 
        position'' as defined by section 8905(d)(4)(C); and
          (ii) is insured for basic insurance under this 
        chapter on the date of separation.
  (B) The applicable date under this subparagraph is October 1, 
2001, except that, for purposes of any involuntary separation 
referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to which 
appropriate specific notice is afforded to the affected 
employee before October 1, 2001, the applicable date under this 
subparagraph is February 1, 2002.

  (a) * * *
          * * * * * * *
  (c)(1) * * *
          * * * * * * *
  (3)(A) The amount of additional optional insurance continued 
under paragraph (2) shall be continued, without any reduction 
under the last two sentences thereof, if--
          (i) at the time of retirement, there is in effect a 
        designation under section 8705 under which the entire 
        amount of such insurance would be paid to an individual 
        who is permanently disabled; and
          (ii) an election under subsection (d)(3) on behalf of 
        such individual is made in timely fashion.
  (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), any reduction required 
under paragraph (2) shall be made if--
          (i) the additional optional insurance is not in fact 
        paid in accordance with the designation under section 
        8705, as in effect at the time of retirement;
          (ii) the Office finds that adequate arrangements have 
        not been made to ensure that the insurance provided 
        under this section will be used only for the care and 
        support of the individual so designated; or
          (iii) the election referred to in subparagraph 
        (A)(ii) terminates at any time before the death of the 
        individual who made such election.
  (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``permanently 
disabled'' shall have the meaning given such term under 
regulations which the Office shall prescribe based on 
subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 1614(a)(3) of the Social 
Security Act, except that, in applying subparagraph (A) of such 
section for purposes of this subparagraph, ``which can be 
expected to last permanently'' shall be substituted for ``which 
has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period 
of not less than twelve months''.
  (d)(1) * * *
          * * * * * * *
  (3)(A) To be eligible for unreduced additional optional 
insurance under subsection (c)(3), the insured individual shall 
be required to elect, at such time and in such manner as the 
Office by regulation requires (including procedures for 
demonstrating compliance with the requirements of subsection 
(c)(3)), to have the full cost thereof continue to be withheld 
from the former employee's annuity or compensation, as the case 
may be, beginning as of when such withholdings would otherwise 
cease under the second sentence of paragraph (1).
  (B) An election made by an insured individual under 
subparagraph (A) (and withholdings pursuant thereto) shall 
terminate in the event that--
          (i) the insured individual--
                  (I) revokes such election; or
                  (II) makes any redesignation or other change 
                in the designation under section 8705 (as in 
                effect at the time of retirement); or
          (ii) the Office finds, upon the application of the 
        insured individual or on its own initiative, that any 
        of the requirements or conditions for unreduced 
        additional optional insurance under subsection (c)(3) 
        are, at any time, no longer met.

                services or supplies has been revoked, 
                suspended, restricted, or not renewed, by a

          (5) Any provider that is currently suspended or

                services or supplies has been revoked, 
                suspended, restricted, or not renewed, by a

                integrity; or
                  (B) that surrendered such a license while a 
                formal disciplinary proceeding was pending 
                before such an authority, if the proceeding 
                concerned the provider's professional 
                competence, professional performance, or 
                financial integrity.
          (2) Any provider that is an entity directly or 
        indirectly owned, or with a 5 percent or more 
        controlling interest, by an individual who is convicted 
        of any offense described in subsection (b), against 
        whom a civil monetary penalty has been assessed under 
        subsection (d), or who has been excluded from 
        participation under this chapter.
          (3) Any provider that the Office determines, in 
        connection with claims presented under this chapter, 
        has charged for health care services or supplies in an 
        amount substantially in excess of such provider's 
        customary charges for such services or supplies (unless 
        the Office finds there is good cause for such charge), 
        or charged for health care services or supplies which 
        are substantially in excess of the needs of the covered 
        individual or which are of a quality that fails to meet 
        professionally recognized standards for such services 
        or supplies.
          (4) Any provider that the Office determines has 
        committed acts described in subsection (d).
  [(c)] (d) Whenever the Office determines--
          [(1) in connection with a claim presented under this 
        chapter, that a provider of health care services or 
        supplies--
                  [(A) has charged for health care services or 
                supplies that the provider knows or should have 
                known were not provided as claimed; or
                  [(B) has charged for health care services or 
                supplies in an amount substantially in excess 
                of such provider's customary charges for such 
                services or supplies, or charged for health 
                care services or supplies which are 
                substantially in excess of the needs of the 
                covered individual or which are of a quality 
                that fails to meet professionally recognized 
                standards for such services or supplies;]
          (1) in connection with claims presented under this 
        chapter, that a provider has charged for a health care 
        service or supply which the provider knows or should 
        have known involves--
                  (A) an item or service not provided as 
                claimed;
                  (B) charges in violation of applicable charge 
                limitations under section 8904(b); or
                  (C) an item or service furnished during a 
                period in which the provider was excluded from 
                participation under this chapter pursuant to a 
                determination by the Office under this section, 
                other than as permitted under subsection 
                (g)(2)(B);
          (2) that a provider of health care services or 
        supplies has knowingly made, or caused to be made, any 
        false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact 
        which is reflected in a claim presented under this 
        chapter; or
          (3) that a provider of health care services or 
        supplies has knowingly failed to provide any 
        information required by a carrier or by the Office to 
        determine whether a payment or reimbursement is payable 
        under this chapter or the amount of any such payment or 
        reimbursement;
the Office may, in addition to any other penalties that may be 
prescribed by law, and after consultation with the Attorney 
General, impose a civil monetary penalty of not more than 
$10,000 for any item or service involved. In addition, such a 
provider shall be subject to an assessment of not more than 
twice the amount claimed for each such item or service. In 
addition, the Office may make a determination in the same 
proceeding to bar such provider from participating in the 
program under this chapter.
  [(d)] (e) The Office--
          (1) may not initiate any debarment proceeding against 
        a provider, based on such provider's having been 
        convicted of a criminal offense, later than 6 years 
        after the date on which such provider is so convicted; 
        and
          (2) may not initiate any action relating to a civil 
        penalty, assessment, or debarment under this section, 
        in connection with any claim, later than 6 years after 
        the date the claim is presented, as determined under 
        regulations prescribed by the Office.
  [(e)] (f) In making a determination relating to the 
appropriateness of imposing or the period of any debarment 
under this section (where such debarment is not mandatory), or 
the appropriateness of imposing or the amount of any civil 
penalty or assessment under this section, the Office shall take 
into account--
          (1) the nature of any claims involved and the 
        circumstances under which they were presented;
          (2) the degree of culpability, history of prior 
        offenses or improper conduct of the provider involved; 
        and
          (3) such other matters as justice may require.
  [(f)(1) The debarment of a provider under subsection (b) or 
(c) shall be effective at such time and upon such reasonable 
notice to such provider, and to carriers and covered 
individuals, as may be specified in regulations prescribed by 
the Office.]
  (g)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), debarment 
of a provider under subsection (b) or (c) shall be effective at 
such time and upon such reasonable notice to such provider, and 
to carriers and covered individuals, as shall be specified in 
regulations prescribed by the Office. Any such provider that is 
excluded from participation may request a hearing in accordance 
with subsection (h)(1).
  (B) Unless the Office determines that the health or safety of 
individuals receiving health care services warrants an earlier 
effective date, the Office shall not make a determination 
adverse to a provider under subsection (c)(4) or (d) until such 
provider has been given reasonable notice and an opportunity 
for the determination to be made after a hearing as provided in 
accordance with subsection (h)(1).
  (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a debarment 
shall be effective with respect to any health care services or 
supplies furnished by a provider on or after the effective date 
of such provider's debarment.
  (B) A debarment shall not apply with respect to inpatient 
institutional services furnished to an individual who was 
admitted to the institution before the date the debarment would 
otherwise become effective until the passage of 30 days after 
such date, unless the Office determines that the health or 
safety of the individual receiving those services warrants that 
a shorter period, or that no such period, be afforded.
  (3) Any notice of debarment referred to in paragraph (1) 
shall specify the date as of which debarment becomes effective 
and the minimum period of time for which such debarment is to 
remain effective. In the case of a debarment under paragraphs 
(1) through (4) of subsection (b), the minimum period of 
exclusion shall not be less than 3 years, except as provided in 
paragraph (4)(B)(ii).
  (4)(A) A provider barred from participating in the program 
under this chapter may, after the expiration of the minimum 
period of debarment referred to in paragraph (3), apply to the 
Office, in such manner as the Office may by regulation 
prescribe, for termination of the debarment.
  (B) The Office may--
          (i) terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant 
        to an application filed by such provider after the end 
        of the minimum debarment period, if the Office 
        determines, based on the conduct of the applicant, 
        that--
                  (I) there is no basis under [subsection (b) 
                or (c)] subsection (b), (c), or (d) for 
                continuing the debarment; and
                  (II) there are reasonable assurances that the 
                types of actions which formed the basis for the 
                original debarment have not recurred and will 
                not recur; or
          * * * * * * *
  [(g)(1) The Office may not make a determination under 
subsection (b) or (c) adverse to a provider of health care 
services or supplies until such provider has been given written 
notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record. A 
provider is entitled to be represented by counsel, to present 
witnesses, and to cross-examine witnesses against the provider 
in any such hearing.
  [(2) Notwithstanding section 8912, any person adversely 
affected by a final decision under paragraph (1) may obtain 
review of such decision in the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Federal Circuit. A written petition requesting that the 
decision be modified or set aside must be filed within 60 days 
after the date on which such person is notified of such 
decision.]
  (h)(1) Any provider of health care services or supplies that 
is the subject of an adverse determination by the Office under 
this section shall be entitled to reasonable notice and an 
opportunity to request a hearing of record, and to judicial 
review as provided in this subsection after the Office renders 
a final decision. The Office shall grant a request for a 
hearing upon a showing that due process rights have not 
previously been afforded with respect to any finding of fact 
which is relied upon as a cause for an adverse determination 
under this section. Such hearing shall be conducted without 
regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of this 
title by a hearing officer who shall be designated by the 
Director of the Office and who shall not otherwise have been 
involved in the adverse determination being appealed. A request 
for a hearing under this subsection must be filed within such 
period and in accordance with such procedures as the Office 
shall prescribe by regulation.
  (2) Any provider adversely affected by a final decision under 
paragraph (1) made after a hearing to which such provider was a 
party may seek review of such decision in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district 
in which the plaintiff resides or has his principal place of 
business by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 60 
days from the date the decision is issued and simultaneously 
sending copies of such notice by certified mail to the Director 
of the Office and to the Attorney General. In answer to the 
appeal, the Director of the Office shall promptly file in such 
court a certified copy of the transcript of the record, if the 
Office conducted a hearing, and other evidence upon which the 
findings and decision complained of are based. The court shall 
have power to enter, upon the pleadings and evidence of record, 
a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or 
in part, the decision of the Office, with or without remanding 
the cause for a rehearing. The district court shall not set 
aside or remand the decision of the Office unless there is not 
substantial evidence on the record, taken as a whole, to 
support the findings by the Office of a cause for action under 
this section or unless action taken by the Office constitutes 
an abuse of discretion.
  (3) Matters that were raised or that could have been raised 
in a hearing under paragraph (1) or an appeal under paragraph 
(2) may not be raised as a defense to a civil action by the 
United States to collect a penalty or assessment imposed under 
this section.
  [(h)] (i) A civil action to recover civil monetary penalties 
or assessments under [subsection (c)] subsection (d) shall be 
brought by the Attorney General in the name of the United 
States, and may be brought in the United States district court 
for the district where the claim involved was presented or 
where the person subject to the penalty resides. Amounts 
recovered under this section shall be paid to the Office for 
deposit into the Employees Health Benefits Fund. The amount of 
a penalty or assessment as finally determined by the Office, or 
other amount the Office may agree to in compromise, may be 
deducted from any sum then or later owing by the United States 
to the party against whom the penalty or assessment has been 
levied.
  [(i)] (j) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which, 
with respect to services or supplies furnished by a debarred 
provider to a covered individual during the period of such 
provider's debarment, payment or reimbursement under this 
chapter may be made, notwithstanding the fact of such 
debarment, if such individual did not know or could not 
reasonably be expected to have known of the debarment. In any 
such instance, the carrier involved shall take appropriate 
measures to ensure that the individual is informed of the 
debarment and the minimum period of time remaining under the 
terms of the debarment.

approve the following health benefits plans:

employee before October 1, 2001, the applicable date under this 
paragraph is February 1, 2002.

                      X. Committee Recommendation

    On July 25, 1996, a quorum being present, the Committee 
ordered the bill favorably reported.

 Committee on Government Reform and Oversight--104th Congress--Rollcall

    Date: July 25, 1996.
    Final Passage of H.R. 3841, as amended.
    Offered by: Hon. John L. Mica (R-FL).
    Voice vote: yea.

    XI. Congressional Accountability Act; Public Law 104-1; Section 
                               102(b)(3)

    H.R. 3841 is inapplicable to the legislative branch because 
it does not relate to any terms or conditions of employment or 
access to public services or accommodations.
                            ADDITIONAL VIEWS

    I am concerned that we are moving too quickly on 
complicated and controversial legislation that affects two 
million Federal workers throughout the nation--not just in 
Washington. For example, in Dade County there are more than 
11,000 Federal employees.
    The Republican majority decided to move this bill quickly. 
The Subcommittee on Civil Service held a legislative hearing on 
July 16 on a July 11 discussion draft. The next day H.R. 3841 
was introduced, and it was approved by the Subcommittee on July 
18. On the morning of July 25 the Committee approved an 87 page 
amendment in the nature of a substitute that had been prepared 
at 8:50 p.m. the previous day.
    This great speed might be all right if there were a 
consensus on all the contents of the bill. But in fact one 
section of the bill as reported by the subcommittee--section 
201--is opposed by many interested parties because of the 
changes it makes in who will be fired when a Federal agency 
must cut the number of its employees.
    Under current regulations, Federal workers who are in an 
agency that is shrinking are retained based on four factors: 
length of service, tenure, veterans' preference and 
performance. The current regulations have a formula for taking 
these four factors into account for each worker.
    Section 201 modifies this formula and then freezes the new 
procedures into a statute.
    The Office of Personnel Management (``OPM'') testified at 
the July 16 hearing that it was ``very concerned'' about 
section 201. OPM said that putting the layoff procedures into a 
statute ``would seriously diminish the current flexibilities of 
the governmentwide performance management system * * * 
Essentially depriving OPM of the ability to regulate in this 
area runs counter to the subcommittees's stated goal of making 
human resources management systems more flexible.''
    On July 24 the Federal Managers Association (``FMA'') urged 
the Committee to drop section 201 from the bill. FMA said that 
``performance appraisers at downsizing agencies today are at 
times improperly motivated to use performance ratings to 
protect favorite employees from RIFs. These favorites are not 
necessarily the ones who are the highest performers.''
    The American Federation of Government Employees (``AFGE'') 
urged that section 201 be deleted from the bill and said that 
``AFGE will oppose the bill if such a deletion does not 
occur.'' The union said that section 201 ``would codify a 
system that arbitrarily and unfairly impacts upon outstanding 
workers who find themselves under a pass-fail system certainly 
through no fault of their own or their exclusive 
representative.''
    The amendments to section 201 approved by the Committee on 
July 25 are improvements. But they do not cure the fundamental 
flaw of section 201: it codifies a firing process for the 
entire Federal government that is better left to the 
flexibility of regulations.
    I believe in performance evaluations of employees. But all 
this opposition to section 201 indicates that this very complex 
portion of this bill is being moved too quickly.

                                                    Carrie P. Meek.
