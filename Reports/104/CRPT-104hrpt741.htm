SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) safe drinking water is essential to the 
        protection of public health;
            (2) because the requirements of the Safe Drinking 
        Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) now exceed the 
        financial and technical capacity of some public water 
        systems, especially many small public water systems, 
        the Federal Government needs to provide assistance to 
        communities to help the communities meet Federal 
        drinking water requirements;
            (3) the Federal Government commits to maintaining 
        and improving its partnership with the States in the 
        administration and implementation of the Safe Drinking 
        Water Act;
            (4) States play a central role in the 
        implementation of safe drinking water programs, and 
        States need increased financial resources and 
        appropriate flexibility to ensure the prompt and 
        effective development and implementation of drinking 
        water programs;
            (5) the existing process for the assessment and 
        selection of additional drinking water contaminants 
        needs to be revised and improved to ensure that there 
        is a sound scientific basis for setting priorities in 
        establishing drinking water regulations;
            (6) procedures for assessing the health effects of 
        contaminants establishing drinking water standards 
        should be revised to provide greater opportunity for 
        public education and participation;
            (7) in considering the appropriate level of 
        regulation for contaminants in drinking water, risk 
        assessment, based on sound and objective science, and 
        benefit-cost analysis are important analytical tools 
        for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of 
        drinking water regulations to protect human health;
            (8) more effective protection of public health 
        requires--
                    (A) a Federal commitment to set priorities 
                that will allow scarce Federal, State, and 
                local resources to be targeted toward the 
                drinking water problems of greatest public 
                health concern;
                    (B) maximizing the value of the different 
                and complementary strengths and 
                responsibilities of the Federal and State 
                governments in those States that have primary 
                enforcement responsibility for the Safe 
                Drinking Water Act; and
                    (C) prevention of drinking water 
                contamination through well-trained system 
                operators, water systems with adequate 
                managerial, technical, and financial capacity, 
                and enhanced protection of source waters of 
                public water systems;
            (9) compliance with the requirements of the Safe 
        Drinking Water Act continues to be a concern at public 
        water systems experiencing technical and financial 
        limitations, and Federal, State, and local governments 
        need more resources and more effective authority to 
        attain the objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act; 
        and
            (10) consumers served by public water systems 
        should be provided with information on the source of 
        the water they are drinking and its quality and safety, 
        as well as prompt notification of any violation of 
        drinking water regulations.

            (4) By adding at the end the following:
            ``(15) Community water system.--The term `community 
        water system' means a public water system that--

                ``piped water for human consumption'' and 
                inserting ``water for human consumption through 
                pipes or other constructed conveyances''.
                    (B) By redesignating subparagraphs (A) and 
                (B) as clauses (i) and (ii), respectively.
                    (C) By striking ``(4) The'' and inserting

SEC. 106. LIMITED ALTERNATIVE TO FILTRATION.

    Section 1412(b)(7)(C) (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(7)(C)) is 
amended by adding the following after clause (iv):
    ``(v) As an additional alternative to the regulations 
promulgated pursuant to clauses (i) and (iii), including the 
criteria for avoiding filtration contained in 40 CFR 141.71, a 
State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public 
water systems may, on a case-by-case basis, and after notice 
and opportunity for public comment, establish treatment 
requirements as an alternative to filtration in the case of 
systems having uninhabited, undeveloped watersheds in 
consolidated ownership, and having control over access to, and 
activities in, those watersheds, if the State determines (and 
the Administrator concurs) that the quality of the source water 
and the alternative treatment requirements established by the 
State ensure greater removal or inactivation efficiencies of 
pathogenic organisms for which national primary drinking water 
regulations have been promulgated or that are of public health 
concern than would be achieved by the combination of filtration 
and chlorine disinfection (in compliance with this section).''.

SEC. 107. GROUND WATER DISINFECTION.

    Paragraph (8) of section 1412(b) (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(8)) 
is amended by moving the margins of such paragraph 2 ems to the 
right and by striking the first sentence and inserting the 
following: ``Disinfection.--At any time after the end of the 3-
year period that begins on the date of enactment of the Safe 
Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, but not later than the 
date on which the Administrator promulgates a Stage II 
rulemaking for disinfectants and disinfection byproducts (as 
described in paragraph (2)(C)), the Administrator shall also 
promulgate national primary drinking water regulations 
requiring disinfection as a treatment technique for all public 
water systems, including surface water systems and, as 
necessary, ground water systems. After consultation with the 
States, the Administrator shall (as part of the regulations) 
promulgate criteria that the Administrator, or a State that has 
primary enforcement responsibility under section 1413, shall 
apply to determine whether disinfection shall be required as a 
treatment technique for any public water system served by 
ground water.''.

SEC. 108. EFFECTIVE DATE FOR REGULATIONS.

    Section 1412(b)(10) (42 U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(10)) is amended to 
read as follows:
            ``(10) Effective date.--A national primary drinking 
        water regulation promulgated under this section (and 
        any amendment thereto) shall take effect on the date 
        that is 3 years after the date on which the regulation 
        is promulgated unless the Administrator determines that 
        an earlier date is practicable, except that the 
        Administrator, or a State (in the case of an individual 
        system), may allow up to 2 additional years to comply 
        with a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique 
        if the Administrator or State (in the case of an 
        individual system) determines that additional time is 
        necessary for capital improvements.''.

using assistance to undertake activities to carry out this 
subsection. There are authorized to be appropriated to the 
Administrator to be used for such technical assistance 
$15,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1997 through 2003. No 
portion of any State loan fund established under section 1452 
(relating to State loan funds) and no portion of any funds made 
available under this subsection may be used for lobbying 
expenses. Of the total amount appropriated under this 
subsection, 3 percent shall be used for technical assistance to 
public water systems owned or operated by Indian Tribes.''.

SEC. 123. OPERATOR CERTIFICATION.

    Part B (42 U.S.C. 300g et seq.) is amended by adding the 
following after section 1418:


                        ``operator certification


    ``Sec. 1419. (a) Guidelines.--Not later than 30 months 
after the date of enactment of the Safe Drinking Water Act 
Amendments of 1996 and in cooperation with the States, the 
Administrator shall publish guidelines in the Federal Register, 
after notice and opportunity for comment from interested 
persons, including States and public water systems, specifying 
minimum standards for certification (and recertification) of 
the operators of community and nontransient noncommunity public 
water systems. Such guidelines shall take into account existing 
State programs, the complexity of the system, and other factors 
aimed at providing an effective program at reasonable cost to 
States and public water systems, taking into account the size 
of the system.
    ``(b) State Programs.--Beginning 2 years after the date on 
which the Administrator publishes guidelines under subsection 
(a), the Administrator shall withhold 20 percent of the funds a 
State is otherwise entitled to receive under section 1452 
unless the State has adopted and is implementing a program for 
the certification of operators of community and nontransient 
noncommunity public water systems that meets the requirements 
of the guidelines published pursuant to subsection (a) or that 
has been submitted in compliance with subsection (c) and that 
has not been disapproved.
    ``(c) Existing Programs.--For any State exercising primary 
enforcement responsibility for public water systems or any 
other State which has an operator certification program, the 
guidelines under subsection (a) shall allow the State to 
enforce such program in lieu of the guidelines under subsection 
(a) if the State submits the program to the Administrator 
within 18 months after the publication of the guidelines unless 
the Administrator determines (within 9 months after the State 
submits the program to the Administrator) that such program is 
not substantially equivalent to such guidelines. In making this 
determination, an existing State program shall be presumed to 
be substantially equivalent to the guidelines, notwithstanding 
program differences, based on the size of systems or the 
quality of source water, providing the State program meets the 
overall public health objectives of the guidelines. If 
disapproved, the program may be resubmitted within 6 months 
after receipt of notice of disapproval.
    ``(d) Expense Reimbursement.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator shall provide 
        reimbursement for the costs of training, including an 
        appropriate per diem for unsalaried operators, and 
        certification for persons operating systems serving 
        3,300 persons or fewer that are required to undergo 
        training pursuant to this section.
            ``(2) State grants.--The reimbursement shall be 
        provided through grants to States with each State 
        receiving an amount sufficient to cover the reasonable 
        costs for training all such operators in the State, as 
        determined by the Administrator, to the extent required 
        by this section. Grants received by a State pursuant to 
        this paragraph shall first be used to provide 
        reimbursement for training and certification costs of 
        persons operating systems serving 3,300 persons or 
        fewer. If a State has reimbursed all such costs, the 
        State may, after notice to the Administrator, use any 
        remaining funds from the grant for any of the other 
        purposes authorized for grants under section 1452.
            ``(3) Authorization.--There are authorized to be 
        appropriated to the Administrator to provide grants for 
        reimbursement under this section $30,000,000 for each 
        of fiscal years 1997 through 2003.
            ``(4) Reservation.--If the appropriation made 
        pursuant to paragraph (3) for any fiscal year is not 
        sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 
        (1), the Administrator shall, prior to any other 
        allocation or reservation, reserve such sums as 
        necessary from the funds appropriated pursuant to 
        section 1452(m) to provide reimbursement for the 
        training and certification costs mandated by this 
        subsection.''.

SEC. 124. PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM SUPERVISION PROGRAM.

    Section 1443(a) (42 U.S.C. 300j-2(a)) is amended as 
follows:
            (1) Paragraph (7) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(7) Authorization.--For the purpose of making 
        grants under paragraph (1), there are authorized to be 
        appropriated $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1997 
        through 2003.''.
            (2) By adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) Reservation of funds by the administrator.--
        If the Administrator assumes the primary enforcement 
        responsibility of a State public water system 
        supervision program, the Administrator may reserve from 
        funds made available pursuant to this subsection an 
        amount equal to the amount that would otherwise have 
        been provided to the State pursuant to this subsection. 
        The Administrator shall use the funds reserved pursuant 
        to this paragraph to ensure the full and effective 
        administration of a public water system supervision 
        program in the State.
            ``(9) State loan funds.--
                    ``(A) Reservation of funds.--For any fiscal 
                year for which the amount made available to the 
                Administrator by appropriations to carry out 
                this subsection is less than the amount that 
                the Administrator determines is necessary to 
                supplement funds made available pursuant to 
                paragraph (8) to ensure the full and effective 
                administration of a public water system 
                supervision program in a State, the 
                Administrator may reserve from the funds made 
                available to the State under section 1452 
                (relating to State loan funds) an amount that 
                is equal to the amount of the shortfall. This 
                paragraph shall not apply to any State not 
                exercising primary enforcement responsibility 
                for public water systems as of the date of 
                enactment of the Safe Drinking Water Act 
                Amendments of 1996.
                    ``(B) Duty of administrator.--If the 
                Administrator reserves funds from the 
                allocation of a State under subparagraph (A),

                each of the activities that would be required 
                of the State if the State had primary 
                enforcement authority under section 1413.''.

SEC. 125. MONITORING AND INFORMATION GATHERING.

    (a) Review of Existing Requirements.--Paragraph (1) of 
section 1445(a) (42 U.S.C. 300j-4(a)(1)) is amended to read as 
follows:
    ``(1)(A) Every person who is subject to any requirement of 
this title or who is a grantee, shall establish and maintain 
such records, make such reports, conduct such monitoring, and 
provide such information as the Administrator may reasonably 
require by regulation to assist the Administrator in 
establishing regulations under this title, in determining 
whether such person has acted or is acting in compliance with 
this title, in administering any program of financial 
assistance under this title, in evaluating the health risks of 
unregulated contaminants, or in advising the public of such 
risks. In requiring a public water system to monitor under this 
subsection, the Administrator may take into consideration the 
system size and the contaminants likely to be found in the 
system's drinking water.
    ``(B) Every person who is subject to a national primary 
drinking water regulation under section 1412 shall provide such 
information as the Administrator may reasonably require, after 
consultation with the State in which such person is located if 
such State has primary enforcement responsibility for public 
water systems, on a case-by-case basis, to determine whether 
such person has acted or is acting in compliance with this 
title.
    ``(C) Every person who is subject to a national primary 
drinking water regulation under section 1412 shall provide such 
information as the Administrator may reasonably require to 
assist the Administrator in establishing regulations under 
section 1412 of this title, after consultation with States and 
suppliers of water. The Administrator may not require under 
this subparagraph the installation of treatment equipment or 
process changes, the testing of treatment technology, or the 
analysis or processing of monitoring samples, except where the 
Administrator provides the funding for such activities. Before 
exercising this authority, the Administrator shall first seek 
to obtain the information by voluntary submission.
    ``(D) The Administrator shall not later than 2 years after 
the date of enactment of this subparagraph, after consultation 
with public health experts, representatives of the general 
public, and officials of State and local governments, review 
the monitoring requirements for not fewer than 12 contaminants 
identified by the Administrator, and promulgate any necessary 
modifications.''.
    (b) Monitoring Relief.--Part B is amended by adding the 
following new section after section 1417 (42 U.S.C. 300g-6):


                      ``monitoring of contaminants


    ``Sec. 1418. (a) Interim Monitoring Relief Authority.--
            ``(1) In general.--A State exercising primary 
        enforcement responsibility for public water systems may 
        modify the monitoring requirements for any regulated or 
        unregulated contaminants for which monitoring is 
        required other than microbial contaminants (or 
        indicators thereof), disinfectants and disinfection 
        byproducts or corrosion byproducts for an interim 
        period to provide that any public water system serving 
        10,000 persons or fewer shall not be required to 
        conduct additional quarterly monitoring during an 
        interim relief period for such contaminants if--
                    ``(A) monitoring, conducted at the 
                beginning of the period for the contaminant 
                concerned and certified to the State by the 
                public water system, fails to detect the 
                presence of the contaminant in the ground or 
                surface water supplying the public water 
                system; and
                    ``(B) the State, considering the 
                hydrogeology of the area and other relevant 
                factors, determines in writing that the 
                contaminant is unlikely to be detected by 
                further monitoring during such period.
            ``(2) Termination; timing of monitoring.--The 
        interim relief period referred to in paragraph (1) 
        shall terminate when permanent monitoring relief is 
        adopted and approved for such State, or at the end of 
        36 months after the date of enactment of the Safe 
        Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, whichever comes 
        first. In order to serve as a basis for interim relief, 
        the monitoring conducted at the beginning of the period 
        must occur at the time determined by the State to be 
        the time of the public water system's greatest 
        vulnerability to the contaminant concerned in the 
        relevant ground or surface water, taking into account 
        in the case of pesticides the time of application of 
        the pesticide for the source water area and the travel 
        time for the pesticide to reach such waters and taking 
        into account, in the case of other contaminants, 
        seasonality of precipitation and contaminant travel 
        time.
    ``(b) Permanent Monitoring Relief Authority.--
            ``(1) In general.--Each State exercising primary 
        enforcement responsibility for public water systems 
        under this title and having an approved source water 
        assessment program may adopt, in accordance with 
        guidance published by the Administrator, tailored 
        alternative monitoring requirements for public water 
        systems in such State (as an alternative to the 
        monitoring requirements for chemical contaminants set 
        forth in the applicable national primary drinking water 
        regulations) where the State concludes that (based on 
        data available at the time of adoption concerning 
        susceptibility, use, occurrence, or wellhead 
        protection, or from the State's drinking water source 
        water assessment program) such alternative monitoring 
        would provide assurance that it complies with the 
        Administrator's guidelines. The State program must be 
        adequate to assure compliance with, and enforcement of, 
        applicable national primary drinking water regulations. 
        Alternative monitoring shall not apply to regulated 
        microbiological contaminants (or indicators thereof), 
        disinfectants and disinfection byproducts, or corrosion 
        byproducts. The preceding sentence is not intended to 
        limit other authority of the Administrator under other 
        provisions of this title to grant monitoring 
        flexibility.
            ``(2) Guidelines.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Administrator shall 
                issue, after notice and comment and at the same 
                time as guidelines are issued for source water 
                assessment under section 1453, guidelines for 
                States to follow in proposing alternative 
                monitoring requirements under paragraph (1) for 
                chemical contaminants. The Administrator shall 
                publish such guidelines in the Federal 
                Register. The guidelines shall assure that the 
                public health will be protected from drinking 
                water contamination. The guidelines shall 
                require that a State alternative monitoring 
                program apply on a contaminant-by-contaminant 
                basis and that, to be eligible for such 
                alternative monitoring program, a public water 
                system must show the State that the contaminant 
                is not present in the drinking water supply or, 
                if present, it is reliably and consistently 
                below the maximum contaminant level.
                    ``(B) Definition.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), the phrase `reliably and 
                consistently below the maximum contaminant 
                level' means that, although contaminants have 
                been detected in a water supply, the State has 
                sufficient knowledge of the contamination 
                source and extent of contamination to predict 
                that the maximum contaminant level will not be 
                exceeded. In determining that a contaminant is 
                reliably and consistently below the maximum 
                contaminant level, States shall consider the 
                quality and completeness of data, the length of 
                time covered and the volatility or stability of 
                monitoring results during that time, and the 
                proximity of such results to the maximum 
                contaminant level. Wide variations in the 
                analytical results, or analytical results close 
                to the maximum contaminant level, shall not be 
                considered to be reliably and consistently 
                below the maximum contaminant level.
            ``(3) Effect of detection of contaminants.--The 
        guidelines issued by the Administrator under paragraph 
        (2) shall require that if, after the monitoring program 
        is in effect and operating, a contaminant covered by 
        the alternative monitoring program is detected at 
        levels at or above the maximum contaminant level or is 
        no longer reliably or consistently below the maximum 
        contaminant level, the public water system must 
        either--
                    ``(A) demonstrate that the contamination 
                source has been removed or that other action 
                has been taken to eliminate the contamination 
                problem; or
                    ``(B) test for the detected contaminant 
                pursuant to the applicable national primary 
                drinking water regulation.
            ``(4) States not exercising primary enforcement 
        responsibility.--The Governor of any State not 
        exercising primary enforcement responsibility under 
        section 1413 on the date of enactment of this section 
        may submit to the Administrator a request that the 
        Administrator modify the monitoring requirements 
        established by the Administrator and applicable to 
        public water systems in that State. After consultation 
        with the Governor, the Administrator shall modify the 
        requirements for public water systems in that State if 
        the request of the Governor is in accordance with each 
        of the requirements of this subsection that apply to 
        alternative monitoring requirements established by 
        States that have primary enforcement responsibility. A 
        decision by the Administrator to approve a request 
        under this clause shall be for a period of 3 years and 
        may subsequently be extended for periods of 5 years.
    ``(c) Treatment as NPDWR.--All monitoring relief granted by 
a State to a public water system for a regulated contaminant 
under subsection (a) or (b) shall be treated as part of the 
national primary drinking water regulation for that 
contaminant.
    ``(d) Other Monitoring Relief.--Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to affect the authority of the States under 
applicable national primary drinking water regulations to alter 
monitoring requirements through waivers or other existing 
authorities. The Administrator shall periodically review and, 
as appropriate, revise such authorities.''.
    (c) Unregulated Contaminants.--Section 1445(a) (42 U.S.C. 
300j-4(a)) is amended by striking paragraphs (2) through (8) 
and inserting the following:

        contaminants.--
                    ``(A) Establishment.--The Administrator

                criteria for a monitoring program for 
                unregulated contaminants. The regulations shall 
                require monitoring of drinking water supplied 
                by public water systems and shall vary the 
                frequency and schedule for monitoring 
                requirements for systems based on the number of 
                persons served by the system, the source of 
                supply, and the contaminants likely to be 
                found, ensuring that only a representative 
                sample of systems serving 10,000 persons or 
                fewer are required to monitor.

SEC. 129. FEDERAL AGENCIES.

    (a) In General.--Section 1447 (42 U.S.C. 300j-6) is amended 
by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d) and by 
striking subsections (a) and (b) and inserting the following:
    ``(a) In General.--Each department, agency, and 
instrumentality of the executive, legislative, and judicial 
branches of the Federal Government--
            ``(1) owning or operating any facility in a 
        wellhead protection area;
            ``(2) engaged in any activity at such facility 
        resulting, or which may result, in the contamination of 
        water supplies in any such area;
            ``(3) owning or operating any public water system; 
        or
            ``(4) engaged in any activity resulting, or which 
        may result in, underground injection which endangers 
        drinking water (within the meaning of section 
        1421(d)(2)),
shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, 
interstate, and local requirements, both substantive and 
procedural (including any requirement for permits or reporting 
or any provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as 
may be imposed by a court to enforce such relief), respecting 
the protection of such wellhead areas, respecting such public 
water systems, and respecting any underground injection in the 
same manner and to the same extent as any person is subject to 
such requirements, including the payment of reasonable service 
charges. The Federal, State, interstate, and local substantive 
and procedural requirements referred to in this subsection 
include, but are not limited to, all administrative orders and 
all civil and administrative penalties and fines, regardless of 
whether such penalties or fines are punitive or coercive in 
nature or are imposed for isolated, intermittent, or continuing 
violations. The United States hereby expressly waives any 
immunity otherwise applicable to the United States with respect 
to any such substantive or procedural requirement (including, 
but not limited to, any injunctive relief, administrative order 
or civil or administrative penalty or fine referred to in the 
preceding sentence, or reasonable service charge). The 
reasonable service charges referred to in this subsection 
include, but are not limited to, fees or charges assessed in 
connection with the processing and issuance of permits, renewal 
of permits, amendments to permits, review of plans, studies, 
and other documents, and inspection and monitoring of 
facilities, as well as any other nondiscriminatory charges that 
are assessed in connection with a Federal, State, interstate, 
or local regulatory program respecting the protection of 
wellhead areas or public water systems or respecting any 
underground injection. Neither the United States, nor any 
agent, employee, or officer thereof, shall be immune or exempt 
from any process or sanction of any State or Federal Court with 
respect to the enforcement of any such injunctive relief. No 
agent, employee, or officer of the United States shall be 
personally liable for any civil penalty under any Federal, 
State, interstate, or local law concerning the protection of 
wellhead areas or public water systems or concerning 
underground injection with respect to any act or omission 
within the scope of the official duties of the agent, employee, 
or officer. An agent, employee, or officer of the United States 
shall be subject to any criminal sanction (including, but not 
limited to, any fine or imprisonment) under any Federal or 
State requirement adopted pursuant to this title, but no 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government shall 
be subject to any such sanction. The President may exempt any 
facility of any department, agency, or instrumentality in the 
executive branch from compliance with such a requirement if he 
determines it to be in the paramount interest of the United 
States to do so. No such exemption shall be granted due to lack 
of appropriation unless the President shall have specifically 
requested such appropriation as a part of the budgetary process 
and the Congress shall have failed to make available such 
requested appropriation. Any exemption shall be for a period 
not in excess of 1 year, but additional exemptions may be 
granted for periods not to exceed 1 year upon the President's 
making a new determination. The President shall report each 
January to the Congress all exemptions from the requirements of 
this section granted during the preceding calendar year, 
together with his reason for granting each such exemption.
    ``(b) Administrative Penalty Orders.--
            ``(1) In general.--If the Administrator finds that 
        a Federal agency has violated an applicable requirement 
        under this title, the Administrator may issue a penalty 
        order assessing a penalty against the Federal agency.

        notice to the agency, assess a civil penalty against 
        the agency in an amount not to exceed $25,000 per day 
        per violation.
            ``(3) Procedure.--Before an administrative penalty 
        order issued under this subsection becomes final, the 
        Administrator shall provide the agency an opportunity 
        to confer with the Administrator and shall provide the 
        agency notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the 
        record in accordance with chapters 5 and 7 of title 5, 
        United States Code.

                may obtain review of an administrative penalty 
                order issued under this subsection. The review 
                may be obtained in the United States District 
                Court for the District of Columbia or in the 
                United States District Court for the district 
                in which the violation is alleged to have 
                occurred by the filing of a complaint with the 
                court within the 30-day period beginning on the 
                date the penalty order becomes final. The 
                person filing the complaint shall 
                simultaneously send a copy of the complaint by 
                certified mail to the Administrator and the 
                Attorney General.

                the record on which the order was issued.

                not set aside or remand the order unless the 
                court finds that there is not substantial 
                evidence in the record, taken as a whole, to 
                support the finding of a violation or that the 
                assessment of the penalty by the Administrator 
                constitutes an abuse of discretion.
                    ``(D) Prohibition on additional 
                penalties.--The court may not impose an 
                additional civil penalty for a violation that 
                is subject to the order unless the court finds 
                that the assessment constitutes an abuse of 
                discretion by the Administrator.''
    ``(c) Limitation on State Use of Funds Collected From 
Federal Government.--Unless a State law in effect on the date 
of enactment of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 
or a State constitution requires the funds to be used in a 
different manner, all funds collected by a State from the 
Federal Government from penalties and fines imposed for 
violation of any substantive or procedural requirement referred 
to in subsection (a) shall be used by the State only for 
projects designed to improve or protect the environment or to 
defray the costs of environmental protection or enforcement.''.

of a national primary drinking water regulation promulgated by 
the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for a

of quality regulation under this subsection for that 
contaminant in bottled water or make a finding that such a 
regulation is not necessary to protect the public health 
because the contaminant is contained in water in public water 
systems (as defined under section 1401(4) of such Act (42 
U.S.C. 300f(4))) but not in water used for bottled drinking 
water. The effective date for any such standard of quality

        regulation under this subsection shall establish a 
        maximum contaminant level for the contaminant in 
        bottled water which is no less stringent than the 
        maximum contaminant level provided in the national 
        primary drinking water regulation.

        primary drinking water regulation under section 1412 of 
        the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-1), the 
        regulation under this subsection shall require that 
        bottled water be subject to requirements no less 
        protective of the public health than those applicable 
        to water provided by public water systems using the 
        treatment technique required by the national primary 
        drinking water regulation.

regulation that pursuant to subparagraph (A) is considered to 
be a standard of quality regulation, the Secretary shall, not 
later than the applicable date referred to in such

        paragraph the effective date for such regulation is the 
        same as the effective date for the regulation for 
        purposes of the Safe Drinking Water Act (or, if the 
        exception under paragraph (1) applies to the 
        regulation, that the effective date for the regulation 
        is not later than 2 years and 180 days after the date

       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendments of the House to the bill S. 1316, to reauthorize 
and amend Title XIV of the Public Health Service Act (commonly 
known as the ``Safe Drinking Water Act''), and for other 
purposes, submit the following joint statement to the House and 
the Senate in explanation of the effect of the action agreed 
upon by the managers and recommended in the accompanying 
conference report:
      The House amendment to the text of the Senate bill struck 
all of the Senate bill after the enacting clause and inserted a 
substitute text.
      The Senate recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the House with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
Senate bill and the House amendment.
      The conference agreement on S. 1316, the Safe Drinking 
Water Act Amendments of 1996, provides (1) revisions to the 
procedures, process, and criteria for regulating contaminants 
in drinking water to protect the public health; (2) special 
programs to help small public water systems meet the 
requirements of the Act; (3) provisions to promote cost-
effectiveness in new drinking water regulations; (4) increased 
flexibility for water suppliers where consistent with public 
health; (5) new programs to promote the proper operation of 
public water systems; (6) substantial new Federal financial and 
technical assistance to help water suppliers meet the 
requirements of the Act and to help States in carrying out 
programs under the Act; (7) refinements and new programs to 
improve protection of public health from drinking water 
contamination; and (8) consumers with information on the source 
of the water they are drinking and its quality and safety.
      Certain matters agreed to in conference are noted below.

             Title I--Amendments to Safe Drinking Water Act

Maximum contaminant level goals (sec. 104(a))
      The Senate recedes from its legislative provision and 
report language (found in Senate Report 104-169, pages 30-33) 
with respect to maximum contaminant level goals for 
carcinogens. The House recedes from all its report language on 
the same subject (House Report 104-632, the first paragraph on 
page 28). The Conferees agree that the Safe Drinking Water Act 
Amendments of 1996 make no changes to the provision or 
legislative history for maximum contaminant level goals.
Disinfectants and disinfection by-products (sec. 104(b))
      The conference agreement addresses the application of 
amended section 1412(b)(5) to the Environmental protection 
Agency's proposed Stage I and Stage II regulations for 
disinfectants and disinfection byproducts. Public water systems 
use disinfectants to kill harmful microbial contaminants that 
can cause serious illness or even death. However, disinfectants 
and their resulting byproducts also may pose risks, including 
potential increases in cancer rates and liver and kidney 
damage. The regulation of both risks from microbial 
contaminants and risks from disinfectants and disinfection 
byproducts presents the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
with a unique challenge. Nonetheless, controls for 
cryptosporidium and disinfection byproducts are widely 
considered to be a pressing and high priority for improving 
drinking water safety.
      In November 1992, EPA convened a negotiated rulemaking to 
examine both the proper strategy for combating cryptosporidium 
and other microbial contaminants and to consider threats to 
human health from the use of disinfectants commonly employed to 
combat microbial contaminants. EPA had determined to use the 
negotiated rulemaking process because the Agency believed that 
``the available occurrence, treatment and health effects data 
were inadequate to address EPA's concern about the tradeoff 
between risks from disinfectants and disinfection byproducts 
and microbial pathogen risk, and wanted all stakeholders to 
participate in the decision-making on setting proposed 
standards.'' (59 Fed. Reg. 38670, July 29, 1994).
      Representatives from EPA, State and local government, 
water suppliers, public health organizations and environmental 
groups, among others, worked for nearly two years to reach 
agreement on a framework for regulating both microbial 
contaminants and disinfection byproducts. The framework will 
result in rules for controlling disinfection byproducts and an 
Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule to address risks posed 
from microbial organisms. The package of rules when fully 
implemented is expected to minimize exposures to harmful 
microbial contaminants while reducing exposure to disinfection 
byproducts that present a health risk by optimizing the use of 
disinfectants and other means of water treatment.
      The negotiating committee agreed that a two-step process 
was necessary to address the microbial and disinfectants and 
disinfection by-products issues. The July 29, 1994 Federal 
Register notice thus proposes both Stage I and Stage II levels 
of control. The Stage I provisions set limits for two principal 
classes of chlorination byproducts, as well as limits for 
specific byproducts resulting from other disinfection 
processes, at levels deemed appropriate as a first step 
standard based on current information. More stringent Stage II 
controls were also proposed for the two classes of chlorination 
byproducts but a second round of negotiations is envisioned. In 
the meantime, EPA is conducting an agreed-upon regime of health 
effects research and water quality monitoring which will be 
used both to finalize the disinfection byproduct rule and the 
Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (as provided for by the 
parties' agreement) and for the second round of negotiations. 
``Based on this information and new data generated through 
research,'' EPA ``will reevaluate the Stage 2 regulations and 
repropose, as appropriate, depending on criteria agreed on in a 
second regulatory negotiation (or similar rule development 
process)'' (59 Fed. Reg. 38743).
      The Conferees acknowledge the delicate balance that was 
struck by the parties in structuring the settlement of these 
complicated and difficult issues, and encourages the parties to 
continue according to the negotiated agreement. The negotiated 
agreement contains an over-arching set of principles to guide 
the individual rulemakings which incorporated consideration of 
various factors. The Conferees intend that all additional 
negotiations weigh the same factors that guided the development 
of the proposed rule. Specifically, all further negotiations 
for the Stage II regulations for the control of disinfection 
byproducts should follow and be consistent with the 
considerations that led to an agreement regarding the proposed 
rule for Stage I.
      In order to preserve the progress made, there has been 
considerable care taken to ensure that the new provisions of 
this conference agreement not conflict with the parties' 
agreement nor disrupt the implementation of the regulatory 
actions. To do otherwise would substantially disrupt, if not 
destroy, the next round of negotiations and lead to unnecessary 
delays in protecting public health. For this reason, the 
conference agreement precludes the use of the new authority in 
section 1412(b)(6) to establish maximum contaminant levels for 
the Stage I and Stage II rulemakings for disinfectants or 
disinfection byproducts or to establish a national primary 
drinking water maximum contaminant level or treatment technique 
for cryptosporidium.
      The Conferees recognize, however, that the development of 
this regulatory package has required the negotiators to 
consider complex issues of risk, costs, affordability, feasible 
technology, and health benefits. It is the Conferees' view that 
the proposed rule that has been produced is consistent with the 
``risk-risk'' provision set out in new section 1412(b)(5). 
Therefore, Section 104(b) makes clear that the Administrator 
may use the authority of section 1412(b)(5) to promulgate Stage 
I and Stage II rules. However, it is also the Conferees' intent 
that no provision of Section 1412(b)(5) be interpreted to force 
an alteration of the negotiated agreement.
      Finally, Section 104(b) of the conference agreement 
provides that for the purpose of promulgating Stage I and Stage 
II regulations for disinfection and disinfection byproducts, 
the consideration that the Administrator used in the 
development of the July 29, 1994 proposal for such regulation 
are to be considered consistent with section 1412(b)(5). These 
considerations included risk, cost, affordability, feasible 
technology, and health benefits. The Conferees intend with this 
language to ensure that the negotiators and ultimately the 
Administrator are authorized to consider these factors in the 
same manner as these considerations were used in developing the 
Stage I proposed rule.
      In the convening process for both the negotiating and 
technical advisory committees for Stage II of the Disinfectant/
Disinfection By-Products rulemaking, the Administrator should 
consider for inclusion appropriate representatives of all 
interested parties, including State and local governments, 
public water systems, public interest groups, public health 
organizations, and experts on chemical disinfectants, their use 
and alternative disinfection process and their technologies.
Arsenic (sec. 109)
      The Conferees encourage EPA to work with the American 
Water Works Association Research Foundation (AWWARF) to carry 
out the study projects authorized by new section 1412(b)(12)(A) 
if AWWARF contributes matching funds.
Consumer confidence reports (sec. 114(a))
      The Administrator may, in regulations, permit the 
notification requirement of subparagraph (A) to be satisfied by 
a means other than postal delivery, such as personal delivery 
or electronic mail, if the Administrator determines that the 
alternative means will provide equivalent notice to individual 
customers.
      EPA regulations should include a clear statement that all 
drinking water, including bottled water, contains contaminants, 
usually at levels below the threshold that would present a 
health risk to humans. The presence of contaminants in drinking 
water does not necessarily indicate that the drinking water is 
unsafe for human consumption. If consumers have any questions 
regarding the levels of contaminants detected in their drinking 
water or the safety of their drinking water, they should be 
directed to contact either their drinking water supplier or EPA 
at the toll-free hotline number.
Bottled water study (sec. 114(b))
      The conference agreement provides that the Administrator 
of the FDA shall provide a study of the feasibility of 
appropriate methods, if any, of informing customers of the 
contents of bottled water. The study is intended to provide 
information on the feasibility of informing customers 
concerning the contents of bottled water, and is not intended 
to prejudge the question of whether such information 
requirements are necessary.
Exemptions (sec. 117)
      Management changes referred to in the conference 
agreement may include rate increases, accounting changes, the 
hiring of consultants, the appointment of a technician with 
expertise in operating such systems, contractual arrangements 
for a more efficient and capable system for joint operation, or 
other reasonable strategies to improve capacity. Restructuring 
changes referred in the conference agreement may include 
ownership change, physical consolidation with another system, 
or other measures to otherwise improve customer base and gain 
economies of scale.
Capacity development (sec. 119)
      The phrase ``legal authority or other means'' is intended 
to require a State to have the actual authority to ensure that 
all new community water systems demonstrate the technical, 
managerial and financial capacity to comply with the Safe 
Drinking Water Act. These could include regulations, training, 
and bonding requirements.
      States are also to adopt and implement a capacity 
development strategy. This is intended to encourage States to 
continue to focus resources on capacity development 
initiatives. States are required to consider, solicit public 
comment on, and include as deemed appropriate by the State, a 
number of elements and criteria.
      The Conferees do not expect that every State will adopt 
the same capacity development strategy and do not expect States 
to include elements in section 1420 (c) that the States 
determine are not appropriate. It is not expected that every 
State will give the same consideration to each of the elements 
listed in section 1420(c). Rather, the Conferees expect that, 
as suggested by existing State capacity development programs, 
State capacity development strategies developed under this 
section will very according to the unique needs of the State. 
The Conferees encourage this diversity and indicate that EPA 
should give deference to a State's determination as to content 
and manner of implementation of a State plan, so long as the 
State has solicited and considered public comment on the listed 
elements and has adopted a strategy that incorporates 
appropriate provisions.
Operator certification reimbursement (sec. 123)
      New subsection 1419(c) requires the Administrator to 
provide reimbursement for the costs of training, including an 
appropriate per diem for unsalaried operators, and 
certification for persons operating systems serving 3,300 
persons or fewer that are required to undergo training pursuant 
to section 1419. The Conferees do not consider the term 
``unsalaried operators'' to include the persons who receive 
compensation at an hourly rate, professional consultants, and 
employees of circuit-rider programs.
State revolving loan funds (sec. 130)
      The administrator is to include, in the guidance for 
State loan fund programs to avoid use of the funds to finance 
expansion of any public water system in anticipation of future 
population growth. The Administrator is not to preclude the use 
of SRF financing for facilities with the capacity necessary to 
meet the objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act for the 
population to be served by the facility over its useful life.
      States are allowed to jointly manage the corpus of the 
new drinking water State loan fund with other revolving loan 
funds. The requirement that the funds be used solely for 
purposes that meet the objectives of the Safe Drinking Water 
Act does not preclude bond pooling arrangements, including 
cross-collateralization, provided that revenues from the bonds 
are allocated to the purposes of the Safe Drinking Water Act in 
the same portion as the funds are used as security for the 
bonds.
Estrogenic substances screening program (sec. 136)
      Section 404 of H.R. 3604 as reported out of the House 
Committee on Commerce formed the basis for section 408(p)(3)(B) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
346a(p)(3) (an estrogenic substances screening program). 
Section 136 of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 
adds to the authority of the Administrator to provide for 
testing of substances that may be found in sources of drinking 
water if the Administrator determines that a substantial 
population may be exposed to such substances. The Conferees 
agree that the treatment of substances addressed under this 
section shall be consistent with the Report of the Commerce 
Committee (House Rep. 104-632, Part I, pp. 55-58).

                   Title II--Drinking Water Research

Clarifications made in conference
      The House Committee on Commerce and the House Committee 
on Science have the following understanding on clarifications 
made in conference. This understanding has no impact on the 
operation of law.

            In reconciling the text of H.R. 3604, the Safe 
        Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, with the text of 
        S. 1316, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 
        1995, the Conference Committee agreed to minor word 
        changes, such as from ``research'' to ``study'', and 
        citation changes and deletions, including the deletion 
        of references in the House passed version of section 
        601. None of these minor changes should be considered 
        to lessen or enhance the House Committee on Science's 
        jurisdictional claim to environmental research 
        involving drinking water issues. None of these minor 
        changes should be considered to lessen or enhance the 
        House Committee on Commerce's jurisdictional claim to 
        biomedical research involving drinking water issues.

                  Title III--Miscellaneous Provisions

Transfer of funds (sec. 302)
      The following represents an understanding between the 
House Committee on Commerce and the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. This understanding has no 
impact on the operation of law.

            The House Commerce Committee, which has 
        jurisdiction over the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the 
        House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, 
        which has jurisdiction over the Federal Water Pollution 
        Control Act, agree to share jurisdiction over the free-
        standing provision in section 302 of the Safe Drinking 
        Water Act Amendments of 1996 involving transfer of 
        revolving loan funds. This provision allows for the 
        transfer of funds, under specified terms and 
        conditions, between the Safe Drinking Water State 
        Revolving Loan Fund which is under the exclusive 
        jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee and the Clean 
        Water State Revolving Fund which is under the exclusive 
        jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure 
        Committee.
            For matters directly amending section 302, the two 
        Committees agree that each should be given equal weight 
        in bill referrals, conference appointments, and other 
        jurisdictional assignments. For instance, a bill to 
        amend section 302 to increase the percentage amount 
        that may be transferred between the two revolving funds 
        would be in the joint jurisdiction of the two 
        Committees. Likewise, a direct or indirect amendment to 
        the provisions of section 302 would be in the 
        committees' joint jurisdiction.
            Enactment of this freestanding section does not 
        give the Commerce Committee any jurisdiction over the 
        Federal Water Pollution Control Act, nor does it give 
        the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee any 
        jurisdiction over the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
        Jurisdiction for changes that amend provisions of the 
        Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Safe 
        Drinking Water Act should be determined without regard 
        to section 302. Thus, for example, a bill to change or 
        impose conditions or limitations on the criteria 
        applicable to a State for the receipt or expenditure of 
        revolving funds under the Safe Drinking Water Act or

Washington Aqueduct (sec. 306)
      The Senate bill authorized the Secretary of the Army 
acting through the Chief of Engineers to borrow from the 
Secretary of the Treasury funds necessary to make capital 
improvements to the Washington Aqueduct. The Washington 
Aqueduct provides drinking water to the three wholesale 
customers of the District of Columbia and the Virginia 
jurisdictions of Arlington County and the City of Falls Church. 
Amounts borrowed from the Treasury are to be repaid by the 
customers.
      The Washington Aqueduct system consists of the Dalecarlia 
and McMillan water treatment plants located in Washington, D.C. 
The system was constructed in 1853 and is under the control of 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for appropriate management and 
maintenance.
      The conference agreement modifies the Senate provision to 
authorize for three years the Secretary of the Army to borrow 
from the Secretary of the Treasury funds to finance capital 
improvements necessary to assure continued operation of the 
Washington Aqueduct.
      The conference agreement encourages and provides a 
process for the establishment of a regional entity--or the use 
of an existing entity--to own, operate, maintain and manage the 
Washington Aqueduct in a manner that fully represents all 
interests of the non-Federal public water supply customers. The 
Secretary of the Army is directed to transfer within the three 
year period all right, title, and interest in Washington 
Aqueduct after receiving the consent of a majority of the 
customers. The Conferees express a strong preference for a 
consensus among all of the customers prior to any transfer of 
the Washington Aqueduct under this section.

Title IV--Additional Assistance for Water Infrastructure and Watersheds

      The conference agreement includes the House provision 
regarding the national grants program for water infrastructure 
and watershed, with a modification to provide that $25 million 
per year is conditioned on the appropriation of 75 percent for 
the amounts authorized per year for the drinking water state 
loan fund. Provisions on the New York City Watershed and Alaska 
rural and Native villages are contained in other titles of the 
conference agreement.
      As in the House bill, section 401(a) establishes a 
national program for technical and financial assistance grants 
for water supply systems and source water quality protection 
programs. The Administrator is directed to provide priority 
consideration to the following:
