  Mr. Young of Alaska, from the Committee on Resources, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 3640]

      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

  The Committee on Resources, to whom was referred the bill 
(H.R. 3640) to provide for the settlement of issues and claims 
related to the trust lands of the Torres-Martinez Desert 
Cahuilla Indians, and for other purposes, having considered the 
same, report favorably thereon with an amendment and recommend 
that the bill as amended do pass.
  The amendment is as follows:
  Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu 
thereof the following:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

  This Act may be cited as the ``Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla 
Indians Claims Settlement Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

  (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that:
          (1) In 1876, the Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation was 
        created, reserving a single, 640-acre section of land in the 
        Coachella Valley, California, north of the Salton Sink. The 
        Reservation was expanded in 1891 by Executive Order, pursuant 
        to the Mission Indian Relief Act of 1891, adding about 12,000 
        acres to the original 640-acre reservation.
          (2) Between 1905 and 1907, flood waters of the Colorado River 
        filled the Salton Sink, creating the Salton Sea, inundating 
        approximately 2,000 acres of the 1891 reservation lands.
          (3) In 1909 an additional 12,000 acres of land, 9,000 of 
        which were then submerged under the Salton Sea, were added to 
        the reservation under a Secretarial Order issued pursuant to a 
        1907 amendment of the Mission Indian Relief Act. Due to 
        receding water levels in the Salton Sea through the process of 
        evaporation, at the time of the 1909 enlargement of the 
        reservation, there were some expectations that the Salton Sea 
        would recede within a period of 25 years.
          (4) Through the present day, the majority of the lands added 
        to the reservation in 1909 remain inundated due in part to the 
        flowage of natural runoff and drainage water from the 
        irrigation systems of the Imperial, Coachella, and Mexicali 
        Valleys into the Salton Sea.
          (5) In addition to those lands that are inundated, there are 
        also tribal and individual Indian lands located on the 
        perimeter of the Salton Sea that are not currently irrigable 
        due to lack of proper drainage.
          (6) In 1982, the United States brought an action in trespass 
        entitled ``United States of America, in its own right and on 
        behalf of Torres-Martinez Band of Mission Indians and the 
        Allottees therein v. The Imperial Irrigation District and 
        Coachella Valley Water District'', Case No. 82-1790 K (M) 
        (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``U.S. Suit'') on 
        behalf of the Torres-Martinez Indian Tribe and affected Indian 
        allottees against the two water districts seeking damages 
        related to the inundation of tribal- and allottee-owned lands 
        and injunctive relief to prevent future discharge of water on 
        such lands.
          (7) On August 20, 1992, the Federal District Court for the 
        Southern District of California entered a judgment in the U.S. 
        Suit requiring the Coachella Valley Water District to pay 
        $212,908.41 in past and future damages and the Imperial 
        Irrigation District to pay $2,795,694.33 in past and future 
        damages in lieu of the United States' request for a permanent 
        injunction against continued flooding of the submerged lands.
          (8) The United States, the Coachella Valley Water District, 
        and the Imperial Irrigation District have filed notices of 
        appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
        Circuit from the district court's judgment in the U.S. Suit 
        (Numbers 93-55389, 93-55398, and 93-55402), and the Tribe has 
        filed a notice of appeal from the district court's denial of 
        its motion to intervene as a matter of right (No. 92-55129).
          (9) The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stayed 
        further action on the appeals pending the outcome of settlement 
        negotiations.
          (10) In 1991, the Tribe brought its own lawsuit, Torres-
        Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, et al., v. Imperial 
        Irrigation District, et al., Case No. 91-1670 J (LSP) 
        (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Indian Suit'') 
        in the United States District Court, Southern District of 
        California, against the two water districts, and amended the 
        complaint to include as a plaintiff, Mary Resvaloso, in her own 
        right, and as class representative of all other affected Indian 
        allotment owners.
          (11) The Indian Suit has been stayed by the District Court to 
        facilitate settlement negotiations.
  (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate and implement 
the settlement agreement negotiated and executed by the parties to the 
U.S. Suit and Indian Suit for the purpose of resolving their 
conflicting claims to their mutual satisfaction and in the public 
interest.

                          PURPOSE OF THE BILL

    The purpose of H.R. 3640 is to provide for the settlement 
of issues and claims related to the trust lands of the Torres-
Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians.

                  BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

    H.R. 3640 would settle a land claim made by the Torres-
Martinez Indian tribe against the United States and two 
irrigation districts in California. This legislation would 
ratify an agreement negotiated between the Administration, the 
Tribe, the Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD) and the 
Imperial Irrigation District (IID).
    The settlement agreement reached between the parties 
provides that the Tribe will receive $14 million in 
compensation for its land losses, $4 million to be paid by the 
two water districts (IID and CVWD) and $10 million to be paid 
by the United States government. In addition, pursuant to the 
agreement, the Tribe is given the right to acquire 11,160 acres 
of land within a specified area adjacent to the existing tribal 
lands and 640 acres of land within another specified area near 
but not adjacent to existing Tribal lands.
    Water rights of local communities will not be changed by 
acquisitions by the Tribe pursuant to this settlement 
agreement. According to the agreement, the Tribe must use canal 
water whenever possible and, when necessary, pay groundwater 
replenishment fees. The agreement also grants to the two water 
districts a permanent drainage easement allowing them to drain 
water into the Salton Sea.

                            COMMITTEE ACTION

    H.R. 3640 was introduced on June 13, 1996, by Congressman 
Sonny Bono (R-CA). The bill was referred to the Committee on 
Resources, and within the Committee to the Subcommittee on 
Native American and Insular Affairs. On June 19, 1996, the 
Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 3640, where the 
Administration testified in favor of H.R. 3640. On June 19, 
1996, the Subcommittee met to mark up H.R. 3640. The bill was 
ordered favorably reported to the Full Committee by voice vote 
without amendment.
    On August 1, 1996, the Full Resources Committee met to 
consider H.R. 3640. An en bloc technical amendment was offered 
by Congressman Don Young (R-AK). The en bloc amendment was 
offered to insure that H.R. 3640 does not abrogate water rights 
and other legal rights when land is taken into trust, to make 
clear that it is not the intent of the settlement agreement to 
impede localities from entering into legally binding 
arrangements with Tribes, and to eliminate a potential 
misreading of the bill to give the Torres-Martinez Tribe 
certain rights not afforded to other tribes. The amendment was 
adopted by voice vote. A technical amendment to change the 
incorrect reference to the north end of the Salton Sink on page 
2 and to insert the date, on page 6, on which all seven 
signatures were obtained for the Settlement Agreement defined 
in the bill was offered by Congressman Elton Gallegly (R-CA),

            COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and clause 
2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives,

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                   Washington, DC, August 19, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3640, the Torres-
Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians Claims Settlement Act.
    Enacting H.R. 3640 would not affect direct spending or 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply 
to the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                            ------  ------,
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).
    Enclosure.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: H.R. 3640.
    2. Bill title: Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians 
Claims Settlement Act.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Resources on August 1, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: H.R. 3640 would ratify a settlement 
agreement entered into by the Department of Justice, the 
Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water 
District, and the Torres-Martinez Cahuilla Indian Tribe. The 
settlement agreement is designed to provide compensation to the 
tribe for the flooding of reservation lands and relief against 
further inundation of those lands. According to the agreement, 
the tribe would receive monetary compensation from the United 
States and the two water districts. In addition, the Interior 
Department would take into trust up to 11,800 acres of land 
acquired by the tribe, and the tribe would be permitted to 
conduct gaming on lands taken into trust pursuant to the 
agreement.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The bill would 
authorize an appropriation of $6 million to the tribe and its 
member landowners. Assuming enactment by the end of fiscal year 
1996 and appropriation of the funds for fiscal year 1997, CBO 
estimates that the tribe would spend out the money over the 
next three years.

                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                                    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spending subject to appropriation:                                                                              
    Authorization level...................................  .......        6  .......  .......  .......  .......
    Estimated outlays.....................................  .......        3        2        1  .......  .......
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The costs of this bill fall within budget function 450.
    The tribe also would receive a payment of $4.2 million from 
the Claims and Judgments Fund. This payment would not represent 
a new obligation of the U.S. government, but would simply 
satisfy a commitment already made. That commitment stems from 
court action begun in 1982 and ultimately resolved by the 
settlement agreement negotiated by the parties to two separate 
suits, both of which have been suspended pending the outcome of 
such negotiations. The agreement entered into by the Department 
of Justice, the water districts, and the tribe calls for 
payment by the U.S. government of $4.2 million to the tribe. 
(The agreement also calls for payments by the two water 
districts to the tribe). Because the settlement agreement 
commits the U.S. government to the $4.2 million payment, 
enacting H.R. 3640 would not cause any increase in direct 
spending from the Claims and Judgments Fund.
    6. Basis of estimates: Funds that the tribe would receive 
may be spent on attorney fees, per capita payments, land 
acquisition, and other activities as stipulated by the 
settlement agreement. CBO expects that some of the funds would 
be spent quickly, while other activities such as the purchase 
of land would take longer. As a result, we estimate that about 
one-half of the $6 million would be spent in the year that 
funds are appropriated, with the remainder spread over the 
subsequent two years.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.
    8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: H.R. 3640 contains no intergovernmental mandates 
as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public 
Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal 
governments. Any costs resulting from the settlement agreement 
covered by this bill would be incurred voluntarily by state, 
local, and tribal governments as parties to the agreement.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would 
impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: On August 9, 1996, CBO prepared 
a cost estimate for S. 1893, the Torres-Martinez Desert 
Cahuilla Indians Claims Settlement Act, as ordered reported by 
the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on July 24, 1996. The 
two bills are very similar, and the estimates are identical.
    11. Estimate prepared by--Federal Cost Estimate: Rachel 
Robertson and Lisa Daley; impact on State, Local, and Tribal 
Governments: Marjorie Miller; impact on the Private Sector: Amy 
Downs.
    12. Estimate approved by: Peter Fontaine, for Paul N. Van 
de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.

                    compliance with public law 104-4

    H.R. 3640 contains no unfunded mandates.

                        changes in existing law

    If enacted, H.R. 3640 would make no changes in existing 
law.
