interests of the United States.

                          PURPOSE OF THE BILL

    The purpose of H.R. 2518 is to authorize the Secretary of 
Agriculture to exchange certain lands in the Wenatchee National 
Forest, Washington, for certain lands owned by Public Utility 
District No. 1 of Chelan County, Washington.

                  BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

    H.R. 2518 provides for the transfer of 122 acres of 
National Forest System lands and a sewage treatment plant to 
the Public Utility District No. 1 (PUD) of Chelan County in 
exchange for 109 acres of unencumbered land owned by the PUD on 
the Wenatchee River. The PUD property is surrounded on three 
sides by national forest and is located on an anadromous fish 
stream which is also a proposed wild and scenic river.
    The sewage treatment plant was built 20 years ago by the 
PUD under a permit from the Wenatchee National Forest for the 
treatment of sewage from the Lake Wenatchee Ranger Station and 
a Forest Service campground. In recent years, due to the 
failure of a septic tank and associated drain field systems of 
several local businesses and private residences, the Forest 
Service agreed to explore options for expanding the use of the 
agency's sewage treatment plant. For the short term, one local 
business has been allowed to connect to the treatment plant and 
agreed to pay its fair share of the treatment cost. To provide 
a long term solution, the PUD agreed to provide wastewater 
treatment services in the Lake Wenatchee area. The most logical 
way to achieve this is for the PUD to take over the existing 
Forest Service plant and enlarge and modernize it.
    Ninety acres of the Forest Service's parcel was appraised 
at $417,000, and the sewage treatment facility was appraised at 
an additional $370,000 in 1993. The 109 acres owned by the PUD 
was appraised at $622,000. The Forest Service would also 
receive the right to use the new facilities. Based on the 1993 
appraisal, the Forest Service would have to pay $205,000 to 
equalize values and an additional $60,000 to complete the ``buy 
in'' of the updated facilities. This legislation requires the 
Secretary of Agriculture to conduct an appraisal to determine 
the current fair market value of the lands and requires payment 
needed to equalize any difference in land value.

                            COMMITTEE ACTION

    H.R. 2518 was introduced on October 20, 1995, by 
Congressman Richard ``Doc'' Hastings (R-WA). The bill was 
referred to the Committee on Resources, and within the 
Committee to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and 
Lands. On June 6, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 
2518, where the Administration supported H.R. 2518 but 
recommended a technical correction. On June 27, 1996, the 
Subcommittee met to mark up H.R. 2518. An amendment to increase 
the acreage of the Forest Service parcel to be exchanged from 
90 to 122 acres was offered by Congressman James V. Hansen (R-
UT), and adopted by voice vote. The bill was then ordered 
favorably reported to the Full Committee. On July 17, 1996, the 
Full Resources Committee met to consider H.R. 2518. A technical 
amendment to clarify how credits received by the Federal 
Government would be applied for any new or modified wastewater 
treatment facilities was offered by Congressman Hastings, and 
adopted by voice vote. The bill as amended was then ordered 
favorably reported to the House of Representatives by voice 
vote in the presence of a quorum.

                      SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 1. Land exchange

    This section provides for the transfer of 122 acres of 
National Forest System lands and a sewage treatment plant to 
the Public Utility District No. 1 (PUD) of Chelan County in 
exchange for 109 acres of unencumbered land owned by the PUD on 
the Wenatchee River. It requires the Secretary of Agriculture 
to conduct an appraisal to determine the current fair market 
value of the lands and requires payment needed to equalize any 
difference in land value.

            COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and clause 
2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
the Committee on Resources' oversight findings and 
recommendations are reflected in the body of this report.

                     INFLATIONARY IMPACT STATEMENT

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that the 
enactment of H.R. 2518 will have no significant inflationary 
impact on prices and costs in the operation of the national 
economy.

                        COST OF THE LEGISLATION

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires an estimate and a comparison by the 
Committee of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out 
H.R. 2518. However, clause 7(d) of that Rule provides that this 
requirement does not apply when the Committee has included in 
its report a timely submitted cost estimate of the bill 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                     COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XI

    1. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(B) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, H.R. 
2518 does not contain any new budget authority, credit 
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax 
expenditures. If enacted, H.R. 2518 would require the Secretary 
of Agriculture to pay PUD approximately $225,000 to equalize 
the value of the lands exchanged under this bill. In addition, 
the bill would reduce discretionary spending by approximately 
$370,000 by providing a credit for the Department of 
Agriculture.
    2. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(D) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee has received no report of oversight findings and 
recommendations from the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight on the subject of H.R. 2518.
    3. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(C) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the 
Committee has received the following cost estimate for H.R. 
2518 from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                     Washington, DC, July 23, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 2518, a bill to authorize the Secretary of 
Agriculture to exchange certain lands in the Wenatchee National 
Forest, Washington, for certain lands owned by Public Utility 
District No. 1 of Chelan County, Washington, and for other 
purposes. The bill was ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Resources on July 17, 1996. Enacting H.R. 2518 could 
increase direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures 
would apply to the bill. CBO estimates that the change in 
direct spending would total less than $500,000. Enacting the 
bill also could lead to a net reduction in discretionary 
spending, but we estimate that such a change would also total 
less than $500,000.
    H.R. 2518 would authorize a land and property exchange, 
subject to certain conditions, between the Department of 
Agriculture and Public Utility District No. 1 (PUD) of Chelan 
County, Washington. The bill provides that if the PUD offers to 
convey about 109 acres to the department, then the Secretary of 
Agriculture would be directed to convey to the PUD about 122 
acres of National Forest System lands, some of which are 
partially occupied by a wastewater treatment facility. The bill 
also would direct the Secretary to convey ownership of the 
wastewater treatment facility to the PUD as part of the 
exchange. The land exchanges are to be of equal fair market 
value, excluding the value of the wastewater treatment 
facility, and the bill would require cash equalization payments 
if the values are unequal. Based on information from the U.S. 
Forest Service, we estimate that completing the exchange would 
require the Forest Service to pay the PUD about $225,000 to 
equalize the exchange values. Therefore, we estimate that 
enacting the bill could increase spending, but that any such 
change would total less than $500,000.
    As a condition for the land exchange and the conveyance of 
the wastewater treatment facility, the bill provides that the 
PUD give the Secretary a credit equal to the fair market value 
of the wastewater treatment facility as of November 4, 1991. 
According to the Forest Service, the wastewater treatment 
facility was valued at about $370,000 as of that date (when the 
agency permitted the PUD to take over operation of the 
federally-owned facility). The PUD has since modernized the 
facility. The credit would be applied to the United States' 
share of the costs to use the wastewater treatment facility. 
Therefore, if the PUD agreed to the exchanges specified in the 
bill, the Forest Service would be able to use a credit of about 
$370,000 towards its expected hook-up charges, thereby reducing 
discretionary spending by that amount.
    H.R. 2518 contains no private-sector or intergovernmental 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local or 
tribal, governments. The exchange authorized by this bill would 
be voluntary on the part of the public utility district.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The staff contacts are Victoria V. 
Heid (for federal costs), and Majorie Miller (for the state, 
local, and tribal impact).
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                    compliance with public law 104-4

    H.R. 2518 contains no unfunded mandates.

                        changes in existing law

    If enacted, H.R. 2518 would make no changes in existing 
law.

                                <greek-d>
