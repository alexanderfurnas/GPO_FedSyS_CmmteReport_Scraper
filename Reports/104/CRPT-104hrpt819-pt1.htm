_______________________________________________________________________


  Mr. Clinger, from the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, 
                        submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 1281]

      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

  The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, to whom was 
referred the bill (H.R. 1281) to amend title 5, United States 
Code, and the National Security Act of 1947 to require 
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act of information 
regarding certain individuals who participated in Nazi war 
crimes during the period in which the United States was 
involved in World War II, having considered the same, report 
favorably thereon with amendments and recommend that the bill 
as amended do pass.
  The amendments are as follows:
  Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu 
thereof the following:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

  This Act may be cited as the ``War Crimes Disclosure Act''.

the reasonably segregable portion would otherwise be required to be 
disclosed under this section.
  ``(4) In the case of a request under this section for any matter 
required to be disclosed under this subsection, if the agency receiving 
such request is unable to locate the records so requested, such agency

amended--
          (1) by redesignating subsections (e) and (f) as subsections

                 I. Background and Need for Legislation

    During this session of Congress, we commemorated the 50th 
anniversary of the conclusion of World War II and the end of 
the Holocaust. Half a century after the Nazi era, one of the 
darkest moments in the history of man's inhumanity to man, it 
is imperative for us to learn all that we can about the 
Holocaust, so that we can ensure that such a tragic episode 
never happens again.
    With the end of the Cold War, Russia and several other 
nations that were formally part of the Soviet Union are opening 
their long secret files on Nazi war crimes. Thanks in part to 
pressure from Congress, the government of Argentina recently 
made its war crimes files open to public scrutiny. The 
Committee believes that our own country should do likewise.
    More can still be learned from the Nazi war crimes files in 
the possession of U.S. government agencies. Some of what we 
might learn will not be pleasant. Evidence exists, for example, 
that the U.S. Government actively recruited Nazis and 
facilitated their entry into our country to pursue early Cold 
War objectives.
    Perhaps the most compelling example of the consequences of 
keeping U.S. Government files hidden is the case of Kurt 
Waldheim. For years, the Central Intelligence Agency was 
keeping its information on Waldheim a secret. This occurred 
even as the Department of Justice was placing Waldheim on the 
``watch list'' of individuals forbidden to enter the United 
States. Imagining the consequences if Waldheim's Nazi past had 
become public is not difficult. Most notably, Waldheim would 
probably not have been elected to the post of Secretary General 
of the United Nations.
    Waldheim continues to deny that he has a Nazi past and 
casts himself as a victim. Not only does he deny any 
involvement in any war crimes, but he blames the American 
Jewish community for his problems. The Committee hopes that the 
passage of H.R. 1281 will facilitate the full disclosure of the 
Waldheim file and ensure that all the facts relating to 
Waldheim are available.
    The U.S. Government's material on Waldheim, and other 
alleged Nazi war criminals, has remained secret although many 
researchers have filed Freedom of Information Act (``FOIA'') 
requests to secure copies of these files. However, Federal 
Government agencies have routinely denied these requests, 
citing exemptions for national defense, foreign relations, and 
intelligence reasons. The Committee recognizes that there may 
be information in these files the disclosure of which would 
indeed harm U.S. interests. However, more than half a century 
after the Second World War, it is time to end the near blanket 
exemption of Nazi war crimes information from FOIA requests.
    The Committee understands that the FOIA must always be 
applied with a sensitive balance of the public's right to know 
and the Government's right to preserve national security. 
Therefore, the bill as reported represents a carefully crafted 
approach to handling FOIA requests about Nazi war criminals. 
H.R. 1281 recognizes the need to change current FOIA policy 
with respect to these records, while protecting the legitimate 
national security requirements of the Government.
    The Committee notes that Executive Order 12958, dated April 
17, 1995, provides for the declassification of national 
security information older than 25 years.<SUP>1 The Committee 
concurs with the sentiment expressed in the Executive Order 
which states:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Executive Order 12958 of April 17, 1995, Classified National 
Security Information. See Federal Register, v. 60, April 20, pp.19825-
19843.

          Our democratic principles require that the American 
        people be informed of the activities of their 
        Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on the 
        free flow of information. Nevertheless, throughout our 
        history, the national interest has required that 
        certain information be maintained in confidence to 
        protect citizens, our democratic institutions, and our 
        participation within the community of nations. 
        Protecting information critical to our Nation's 
        security remains a priority. In recent years, however, 
        dramatic changes have altered, although not eliminated 
        the national security threats we confront. These 
        changes provide a greater opportunity to emphasize our 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        commitment to open government.

    In this spirit, records in agency archives about Nazi war 
criminals should finally be made available to the public.

             II. Legislative Hearings and Committee Action

    Mrs. Maloney introduced H.R. 1281 on March 21, 1995. The 
bill was referred to the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight. In addition, the Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence and the Committee on the Judiciary also received 
referrals. On June 14, 1996, the Subcommittee on Government 
Management, Information and Technology held a legislative 
hearing on H.R. 1281.
    H.R. 1281 was marked up on July 12, 1996 by the 
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and 
Technology. Mrs. Maloney offered an amendment in the nature of 
a substitute. No additional amendments were offered and the 
legislation was passed by the subcommittee unanimously.
    The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight met on 
July 25, 1996. No amendments were offered and H.R. 1281 was 
unanimously reported to the House by voice vote.

             III. Committee Hearings and Written Testimony

    On June 13th and 14th, 1996, the Subcommittee on Government 
Management, Information and Technology of the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight, held hearings on Federal 
information policy. The Subcommittee devoted the first day of 
hearings to oversight of information policy. The second day was 
a legislative hearing which considered related amendments to 
the Freedom of Information Act: H.R. 1281; ``The War Crimes 
Disclosure Act''; and S. 1090, ``The Electronic Freedom of 
Information Improvement Act of 1995.'' <SUP>2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ The Subcommittee subsequently considered H.R. 3802, the 
``Electronic Freedom of Information Amendments of 1996,'' which was 
introduced by Representative Tate on July 12, 1996. This legislation 
passed the House of Representatives on September 17, 1996.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In his remarks, Chairman Horn noted his conviction that 
various administrations had erred opposing the release of 
information of historical significance. He noted his surprise 
at learning at the prior day's hearing that some records of the 
First World War had not yet been made public. Citing the 
example of the Pentagon Papers, he said: ``I never could 
understand why one administration contests the release of 
records of historical interest of a prior administration. I 
thought the day the Pentagon Papers came out, Nixon ought to 
have said, `Hey, it isn't our show, Let's print them.' ''
    Representative Maloney, the ranking member, in her opening 
statement explained her reasons for sponsoring H.R. 1281, 
commenting:

          I introduced H.R. 1281 to close what I perceive is a 
        tremendous loophole in the FOIA. Under current law, the 
        FOIA allows Government agencies to block the release of 
        information for a variety of reasons, including 
        outdated ``national security'' arguments no longer 
        valid in the post Cold War era.

    The Subcommittee received testimony concerning H.R. 1281 
from Representative Tom Lantos, former Representative Elizabeth 
Holtzman and Professor Robert Herzstein, a member of the 
Department of History at the University of South Carolina.
    Representative Maloney observed in her introduction of 
Representative Lantos that he is the only Holocaust survivor in 
Congress. Representative Lantos supported the bill, noting: 
``What we are dealing with in this legislation is a desperate 
race against time, because those who are guilty of the most 
heinous atrocities against fellow human beings in the history 
of mankind are rapidly reaching an age where they are passing 
on and will be no longer with us.''
    Ms. Holtzman recounted her own legislative efforts as a 
Member of Congress in strengthening U.S. efforts at tracking 
down and prosecuting fugitive war criminals. As a result of her 
legislative initiatives, suspected Nazi war criminals were 
placed on a ``Watch List'' of individuals excluded from 
admission to the United States. In addition the efforts of the 
Department of Justice to prosecute suspected Nazi war criminals 
were strengthened. Ms. Holtzman expressed her concern that the 
bill could unintentionally undermine the work of the Department 
of Justice's Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in tracking 
down and expelling Nazi war criminals. She noted that the 
Committee had received a letter from the Department that 
detailed their concerns. As an alternative, Ms. Holtzman 
suggested making subject to the legislation the files only of 
those agencies, or their successor agencies, that would have 
had direct contact with Nazi war criminals. The agencies 
include: the Department of State, the Department of Defense, 
the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, 
the National Security Council, and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. Ms. Holtzman also proposed that for alleged Nazi 
war criminals, a blanket rule be adopted, i.e., any information 
in the files of any U.S. agency as of 1966 be made available.
    Professor Herzstein recounted his experience researching 
the activities of Kurt Waldheim. Because of agency denials of 
his FOIA requests, Professor Herzstein maintained that 
historically valuable information about Waldheim had been kept 
secret. He relayed his conclusion based on existing records 
that U.S. agencies were aware of information implicating 
Waldheim in war crimes. Nevertheless, Professor Herzstein 
asserted, Waldheim maintained a long-term confidential 
relationship with both the Department of State and the Central 
Intelligence Agency.
    Representative Maloney expressed her interest in obtaining 
a full accounting of U.S. government contacts with Waldheim, 
noting that: ``I drafted H.R. 1281 to ensure that the entire 
Waldheim file is finally made public. It is also my hope that 
the enactment of this bill would help those who research the 
horrors of the Holocaust ensure that cases like Waldheim's do 
not occur in the future.''

                      IV. Explanation of the Bill

                              A. Overview

    The War Crimes Disclosure Act amends the Freedom of 
Information Act to require specified Government agencies to 
fulfill FOIA requests about individuals who committed war 
crimes during the Nazi era.

                     B. Section-by-Section Analysis

Section 1--Short title

    The Act may be cited as the ``War Crimes Disclosure Act.''

Section 2--Requirement of disclosure under Freedom of Information Act 
        of information regarding individuals who committed Nazi war 
        crimes

                    Section 2(a)--Nazi war criminals

    The bill makes certain information about individuals 
reasonably believed to have participated in Nazi war crimes 
subject to the Freedom of Information Act. The Committee 
expects that a requestor would present some evidence to support 
the request. Examples of possible supporting evidence include: 
press clippings, historical records, scholarly literature, 
affidavits from credible witnesses, evidence from the files of 
another country or the appearance of the individual on the 
Department of Justice's Immigration and Naturalization 
Service's ``Watch List,''. The ``Watch List'' or Automated Visa 
Lookout System is maintained by the Departments of State and 
Justice, pursuant to immigration law, and lists aliens who are 
ineligible for entry into the U.S. As a result of the Holtzman 
Amendment, certain suspected Nazi war criminals were added to 
this watch list.<SUP>3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(e), P.L. 95-549.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A mere assertion by the requestor that the subject of a 
request had been a Nazi war criminal would not be sufficient to 
trigger the provisions of this bill. A finding by a U.S. agency 
that the subject of a FOIA request under this bill is a 
suspected war criminal should be given considerable weight. In 
absence of strong supporting evidence, broad latitude should be 
extended to a determination by an agency receiving a FOIA 
request about whether the subject of the request qualifies 
under the provisions of this bill.
            Section 2(a)--Specified agencies
    The bill specifies seven departments and agencies that the 
Committee understands are likely to be in possession of Nazi 
war crimes files: The Department of State, the Department of 
Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security 
Agency, the National Security Council, and the United States 
Information Agency (USIA). In addition the Federal Bureau of 
Investigations, within the Department of Justice was included. 
The bill also specifies that all predecessor agencies and all 
components of these agencies and departments are also included. 
For example, Radio Liberty would be covered because it is now a 
component of the USIA.
    This legislation reflects existing legislative policy that 
each of these agencies are subject to the FOIA. The records of 
each of these agencies are currently fully subject to FOIA 
requests, subject to the enumerated exemptions. This 
legislation affects the application of the FOIA exemptions 
regarding records held by these agencies.
            Section 2(a)--Exemptions
    The bill incorporates several exemptions to the disclosure 
requirements of the bill. Records that do not relate to an 
alleged Nazi criminal, and which are reasonably segreable from 
other records would be subject to all the existing exemption 
protections of the Freedom of Information Act.
            Section 2(a)--Exemptions for intelligence
    The Committee believes that there are legitimate reasons 
for intelligence agencies not to disclose certain files, but 
that these reasons must have currency and the harm caused by 
disclosure must substantially outweigh the public benefit. 
Exemptions include matters the disclosure of which would 
either: 1) reveal an intelligence agent whose identity 
currently requires protection; 2) reveal a confidential source 
thus posing harm to that individual; or 3) compromise an 
intelligence agreement between the U.S. and a foreign 
government or individual. In each case, the agency must show 
clear and convincing evidence that the disclosure of the 
information would cause harm that substantially outweighs the 
public good.
    As noted above, Executive Order 12958 provides an 
administrative framework for the declassification of records 
older than 25 years. The policies in this order express a clear 
mandate to expedite the declassification of historical records, 
consistent with continuing national security interests.
            Section 2(a)--Additional national interest exemptions
    The intent of this subparagraph is to modernize the 
traditional national security exemptions. The Committee wishes 
to end the practice of blocking the release of material because 
it threatened interests of the United States in the past. In 
order for an agency to cite national security, military 
defense, intelligence, or foreign relations exemptions, it must 
show the current or future threats posed by disclosure. Again, 
the threat of disclosure must substantially outweigh the public 
interest that would accrue by the release of the material.
            Section 2(a)--Exemption for Office of Special 
                    Investigations records
    The intention of this bill is to expose Nazi secrets and 
not, of course, to hinder the prosecution and extradition of 
Nazi war criminals. For that reason, the bill exempts any 
records created in connection with an investigation, inquiry, 
or prosecution by the Government's Nazi-hunting unit, the 
Office of Special Investigations (OSI).
    The Committee was concerned that if OSI files were covered 
by this bill, the OSI's valuable work would be hampered. 
Disclosure of OSI material could provide Nazi war criminals 
with investigation and litigation strategies being used against 
them. In addition, given OSI's declining resources and 
increasing time constraints, the Committee does not want to see 
the office consumed with the task of fulfilling FOIA requests, 
particularly since these requests are likely to be filed by the 
families and defense attorneys of the accused Nazi war 
criminals.
    The Committee does want to make it clear that there is 
ample material in OSI files that originally came, and still 
exists, in the files of agencies covered by the bill. This 
material should be disclosed if requested. For example, an 
original file about a Nazi war criminal might exist in the 
Department of State. A copy of that material may have been sent 
to OSI. Since the file was not created in connection with an 
OSI investigation, it could be obtained from State. However, a 
State Department copy of a memorandum from OSI to State 
requesting the file of a war criminal would not be disclosed, 
because it was created in connection with an OSI investigation.
            Section 2(a)--Reasonable segregation of material
    The Committee intends that if a portion of a file requested 
under this legislation is not to be disclosed in accordance 
with one of the exemptions, this does not mean that the entire 
file needs to be kept secret. Portions of files that can be 
reasonably segregated from the exempted material must be 
disclosed. This provision is intended to ensure that the 
agencies covered by the bill do not continue the practice of 
exempting large volumes of material simply because part of a 
file is excludable. Agencies redacting exempted material should 
communicate with requestors about the reasons for and the 
extent of material redacted. If appropriate, agencies should 
communicate with requestors on alternative avenues to obtaining 
requested information, so as not to compromise protected 
interests.
            Section 2(a)--Proof of thorough search
    This provision mandates that an agency show proof of the 
steps taken to find a particular file if, in fact, the material 
was not found.
            Section 2(b)--Inapplicability of National Security Act of 
                    1947 exemption
    This section amends the National Security Act to ensure 
that the same disclosure procedures contained in this bill are 
applied to operation files of the Central Intelligence Agency 
that are subject to FOIA requests.<SUP>4 Any disclosure of the 
material contained in such files must be carefully balanced to 
protect the national interest. Some information contained in 
Government files may be recent enough to raise legitimate 
issues of concern for national security. The intent of the 
Committee is to make available information of historical 
interest, but not to jeopardize national security.

found in the bill and in this report.

                  VI. Budget Analysis and Projections

    This Act provides for no new authorizations or budget 
authority or tax expenditures. Consequently, the provisions of 
section 308(a)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act are not 
applicable.

         VII. Cost Estimate of the Congressional Budget Office

    The Committee was provided with the following estimate of 
the cost of H.R. 1281, as prepared by the Congressional Budget 
Office.

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 10, 1996.
Hon. William F. Clinger, Jr.,
Chairman, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, House of 
        Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 1281, the War Crimes Disclosure Act, as ordered 
reported by the House Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight on July 25, 1996. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 
1281 would not have a significant impact on the federal budget. 
Because the bill would not affect direct spending or receipts, 
pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.
    H.R. 1281 would require that certain agencies disclose 
information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on 
individuals for whom their exists reasonable grounds to believe 
they participated or assisted in the execution of Nazi war 
crimes. Specifically, the bill would direct the Central 
Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, the National 
Security Agency, the National Security Council, the Department 
of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to disclose 
such information if its disclosure would not threaten (1) 
national security or foreign relations interests, (2) the 
investigation or prosecution of such individuals by the 
Department of Justice, (3) the safety of a confidential 
informant to the United States government, or (4) the identify 
of an intelligence agent who currently requires protection. The 
bill's provisions would apply to request received 180 days 
after enactment.
    The bill would increase from researchers, citizens, and 
public interest groups for new information that might become 
available if it were enacted, but it would also reduce the 
number of a repeat requests and appeals for information denied 
to such individuals under current law. For calendar year 1992--
the most recent year for which data was available on FOIA 
activities--the average cost across all agencies to process a 
FOIA request was $189. For some agencies, such costs are 
considerably higher. For instance, the average cost reported by 
the Department of State in 1992 was $1,092. Thus, even assuming 
the higher cost per request, FOIA costs would still increase by 
less than $1 million a year as long as any net increase in the 
number or annual requests is less than about 1,000. Agencies 
received about 575,000 requests in 1992.
    H.R. 1281 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would have no impact on the budgets of 
state, local, or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contract is John R. 
Righter.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).

                  VIII. Inflationary Impact Statement

    In accordance with rule XI, clause 2(l)(4) of the Rules of 
the House of Representative, this legislation is assessed to 
have no inflationary effect on prices and costs in the 
operation of the national economy.
