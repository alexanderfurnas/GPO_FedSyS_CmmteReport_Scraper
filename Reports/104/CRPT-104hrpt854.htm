Armed Forces and Federal civilian employees. Child development 
service benefits provided under the authority of this section 
shall be in addition to benefits provided under other laws.

Commandant may require that amounts received as fees for the 
provision of services under this section at Coast Guard child 
development centers be used only for compensation of employees 
at those centers who are directly involved in providing child 
care.
      ``(2) If the Commandant determines that compliance with 
the limitation in paragraph (1) would result in an uneconomical 
and inefficient use of such fee receipts, the Commandant may 
(to the extent that such compliance would be uneconomical and 
inefficient) use such receipts--
            ``(A) for the purchase of consumable or disposable 
        items for Coast Guard child development centers; and

        consumable or disposable items for a given fiscal year

employees under this section meet minimum standards of training 
with respect to early childhood development, activities and 
disciplinary techniques appropriate to children of different 
ages, child abuse prevention and detection, and appropriate 
emergency medical procedures.
      ``(d) Of the amounts available to the Coast Guard each 
fiscal year for operating expenses (and in addition to amounts 
received as fees), the Secretary may use for child development 
services under this section an amount not to exceed the total 
amount the Commandant estimates will be received by the Coast 
Guard in the fiscal year as fees for the provision of those 
services.
      ``(e) The Commandant may use appropriated funds available 
to the Coast Guard to provide assistance to family home day 
care providers so that family home day care services can be 
provided to uniformed service members and civilian employees of 
the Coast Guard at a cost comparable to the cost of services 
provided by Coast Guard child development centers.
      ``(f) The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to 
implement this section. The regulations shall establish fees to 
be charged for child development services provided under this 
section which take into consideration total family income.
      ``(g) For purposes of this section, the term `child 
development center' does not include a child care services 
facility for which space is allotted under section 616 of the 
Act of December 22, 1987 (40 U.S.C. 490b).''.

        transportation modes and eliminate, for as long as a 
        port remains subject to effective competition, 
        unnecessary Federal regulatory oversight or involvement 
        in the ports' business and economic decisions; and
            (4) promote innovation, flexibility, and efficiency 
        in the management and operation of deepwater ports by

            (1) in subsection (j)(2)(A) by inserting after 
        ``paragraph (4),'' the following: ``and of information 
        regarding previous spills, including data from 
        universities, research institutions, State governments, 
        and other nations, as appropriate, which shall be 
        disseminated as appropriate to response groups and area 
        committees, and''; and
            (2) in subsection (j)(4)(c)(v) by inserting before 
        ``describe'' the following: ``compile a list of local 
        scientists, both inside and outside Federal Government 
        service, with expertise in the environmental effects of 
        spills of the types of oil typically transported in the 
        area, who may be contacted to provide information or, 
        where appropriate, participate in meetings of the 
        scientific support team convened in response to a 
        spill'', and''.

SEC. 1144. COMPLIANCE WITH OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLANS.

    Section 311(c)(3)(B) of the Federal Water Pollution Control 
Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(c)(3)(B)) is amended by striking 
``President'' and inserting ``President, except that the owner 
or operator may deviate from the applicable response plan if 
the President or the Federal On-Scene Coordinator determines 
that deviation from the response plan would provide for a more 
expeditious or effective response to the spill or mitigation of 
its environmental effects''.

SEC. 1145. BRIDGE DEEMED TO UNREASONABLY OBSTRUCT NAVIGATION.

    The Sooline & Milwaukee Road Swing Bridge, located in 
Oshkosh, Wisconsin, is deemed to unreasonably obstruct 
navigation for purposes of the Act of June 21, 1940 (popularly 
known as the Hobbs Bridge Act; 33 U.S.C. 511 et seq.).

SEC. 1146. FISHING VESSEL EXEMPTION.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 81 of title 46, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
section:

``Sec. 8105. Fishing vessel exemption

    ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the 
International Convention on Standards of Training, 
Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, nor any 
amendment to such convention, shall apply to a fishing vessel, 
including a fishing vessel used as a fish tender vessel.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 
81 of title 46, United States Code, is amended by adding at the 
end the following:

``8105. Fishing vessel exemption.''.

      And the House agree to the same.

       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendment of the House to the bill (S. 1004) to authorize 
appropriations for the United States Coast Guard, and for other 
purposes, submit the following joint statement to the House and 
the Senate in explanation of the effect of the action agreed 
upon by the managers and recommended in the accompanying 
conference report:
      The House amendment struck all of the Senate bill after 
the enacting clause and inserted a substitute text.
      The Senate recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the House with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
Senate bill and the House amendment. The differences between 
the Senate bill, the House amendment, and the substitute agreed 
to in conference and noted below, except for clerical 
corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements 
reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clerical 
changes.

                         section 1. short title

      Section 1 of the Senate bill states that the Act may be 
cited as the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996.'' This 
section of the House amendment states that the Act may be cited 
as the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996.''
      The Conference substitute cites the Act as the ``Coast 
Guard Authorization Act of 1996.''

                      section 2. table of contents

      Section 2 of the Senate bill, the House amendment, and 
the conference substitute provide a table of contents for the 
bill.

                        Title I--Authorizations

              section 101. authorization of appropriations

      Section 101 of the Senate bill authorizes Coast Guard 
appropriations for Fiscal Year (FY) 1996, at the following 
levels:

                                                        Fiscal year 1996
Operating Expenses......................................  $2,618,316,000
AC&I....................................................     428,200,000
R&D.....................................................      22,500,000
Retired Pay.............................................     582,022,000
Alteration of Bridges...................................      16,200,000
Environmental Compliance................................      25,000,000

      This bill also authorizes the transfer of funds from the 
discretionary bridge program of the Federal Highway 
Administration to the Coast Guard for alteration of highway 
bridges that are determined to be obstructions to navigation.
      Section 101 of the House amendment contains identical 
authorization levels, but does not contain the funding change 
for alteration of highway bridges that are determined to be 
obstructions to navigation.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision 
with an amendment to authorize Coast Guard appropriations for 
fiscal year 1997 at the following levels:

                                                        Fiscal year 1997
Operating Expenses......................................  $2,637,800,000
AC&I....................................................     411,600,000
R&D.....................................................      20,300,000
Retired Pay.............................................     608,100,000
Alteration of Bridges...................................      25,100,000
Environmental Compliance................................      25,000,000

      The Conference Committee recommends that a study be 
conducted to look at ways the aviation program could cut its 
operating and replacement costs. The study should include 
looking at alternative aircraft to replace some of the aging 
HC-130's and HU-25's. The Committee believes some surveillance 
missions could be done by aircraft that are much less costly to 
operate. Further, the Committee believes there may be creative 
ways these alternate aircraft may be acquired without major 
capital expense. The Coast Guard shall report back to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House and 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the 
Senate by December 15, 1997.

    section 102. authorized levels of military strength and training

      Section 102 of the Senate bill authorizes a Coast Guard 
end-of-year strength of 38,400 active duty military personnel 
and military training student loads for fiscal year 1996. These 
authorized strength levels would not include members of the 
Coast Guard Ready Reserve called to active duty for special or 
emergency augmentation of regular Coast Guard forces for period 
of 180 days or less.
      Section 102 of House amendment has the identical strength 
numbers, but does not contain the Coast Guard Ready Reserve 
provision.
      The Conference substitute amends the House provision by 
authorizing a Coast Guard end-of-year strength of 37,561 by the 
end of fiscal year 1997 and military training student loads for 
fiscal year 1997.

           section 103. quarterly report on drug interdiction

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      Section 103 of the House amendment requires the Secretary 
of Transportation to submit to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure in the House of Representatives and 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in the 
Senate quarterly reports on Coast Guard drug interdiction 
expenditures. The requirement for quarterly reports will allow 
the Committees to closely monitor the expenditures for Cost 
Guard drug interdiction, and to ensure that critical drug 
interdiction resources are not diverted to other Coast Guard 
missions.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

  section 104. sense of the congress regarding funding for the coast 
                                 guard

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      Section 422 of the House amendment states that it is the 
sense of Congress that Congress should appropriate for the 
Coast Guard adequate funds to enable it to carry out all 
extraordinary functions and duties the Coast Guard is required 
to undertake in addition to its normal functions established by 
law.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House amendment.

               Title II--Personnel Management Improvement

          section 201. provision of child development services

      Section 201 of the Senate bill adds a new section 515 to 
title 14, United States Code, authorizing the Coast Guard to 
establish a program to provide child development services for 
members of the armed forces and Federal civilian employees. 
Subsection (a) of new section 515 provides authority for the 
Commandant to expend appropriated funds to make child 
development services available. Subsection (b) of the new 
section establishes priorities for the use of parents' fees. 
Subsection (c) requires regular inspections of Coast Guard 
child care centers and establishes minimum requirements for 
training child care center employees. Subsection (d) authorizes 
the use of Coast Guard operating expenses in an amount not to 
exceed annual child care receipts to support child care center 
operation. Subsection (e) authorizes the use of appropriated 
funds to provide assistance to home day-care providers. 
Subsection (f) authorizes the Secretary to charge fees for 
child development services provided.
      Section 203 of the House amendment amends section 93 of 
title 14, United States Code, to authorize the Coast Guard to 
establish a program to provide child development services for 
military members and civilian employees. This program provided 
in this section is similar in most respects to the existing 
Department of Defense child care development program.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House amendment.

                  section 202. hurricane andrew relief

      Section 202 of the Senate bill authorizes Coast Guard 
military personnel assigned to a facility around Homestead Air 
Force Base, Florida, on or before August 24, 1992, to be 
compensated if they are unable to sell their homes due to 
damage from Hurricane Andrew.
      Section 201 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate bill.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

    section 203. dissemination of results of 0-6 continuation boards

      Section 203 of the Senate bill amends section 289 of 
title 14 United States Code, eliminating the requirement for 
dissemination to the service at large of the result of boards 
convened to recommend captains for continuation on active duty.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

    SECTION 204. EXCLUDE CERTAIN RESERVES FROM END-OF-YEAR STRENGTH

      Section 204 of the Senate bill amends section 712 of 
title 14, United States Code, to eliminate the requirement to 
include Coast Guard Reservists ordered to active duty in the 
calculation of Coast Guard end-of-year personnel strength. This 
new authority parallels the Secretary of Transportation's 
existing authority to exceed annual Coast Guard end-of-year 
strength ceilings in order to respond to national defense 
emergencies.
      Section 202 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate bill.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

        SECTION 205. OFFICER RETENTION UNTIL RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE

      Section 205 of the Senate bill amends section 283(b) of 
title 14, United States Code, to allow Coast Guard officers 
with at least 18 years of service, and who have been passed 
over for promotion twice, to continue on active duty until they 
are eligible for retirement after 20 years of service. A 
similar provision applies to members of the Coast Guard Reserve 
and the other branches of the armed forces.
      Section 205 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate bill.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                        section 206. recruiting

      Section 207 of the Senate bill expands the Coast Guard's 
authority to recruit its military work force. Subsection (a) 
amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
1995 to extend to the Department of Transportation a provision 
that denies funds to institutions of higher education that have 
a policy of denying recruiters from the armed forces access to 
their campuses or students, or denying access to director 
information pertaining to students.
      Subsection (b) provides specific authority for the Coast 
Guard to use operating funds for entertainment expenses arising 
from recruiting activities in the Coast Guard's ``centers of 
influence'' program, modeled after the programs of the Navy, 
Marine Corps, and Air Force.
      Subsection (c) expands the Coast Guard's authority to 
enter into contracts with, and make grants to, public and 
private organizations and individuals for the purpose of 
meeting identified personnel resource requirements. Students 
who successfully qualify for the program would be offered a 
one-year or two-year scholarship that would pay for all or part 
of the tuition and related living expenses while enrolled in a 
college or university.
      Section 407 of the House amendment requires the Coast 
Guard to submit a report to the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure in the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in the 
Senate on efforts to recruit women and minorities, and to make 
recommendations on the need for future action in this area.
      Section 206 of the Conference substitute adopts 
subsections (a) and (b) of section 207 of the Senate bill. 
Subsection (a) denies funds to institutions which do not allow 
Coast Guard recruiters on campus. Subsection (c) allows the 
Coast Guard to use operating funds to cover advertising and 
entertainment expenses related to certain recruiting 
activities. Section 207(c) of the conference substitute 
includes the study on recruiting women and minorities from 
section 407 of the House amendment.

section 207. access to national driver register information on certain 
                         coast guard personnel

      Section 208(a) of the Senate bill amends section 93 of 
title 14, United States Code, to authorize the Commandant of 
the Coast Guard to require that Coast Guard military personnel 
request all information contained in the National Driver 
Register (NDR) pertaining to the individual and be made 
available to the Commandant. Current law allows an employer to 
have access to the NDR records of an individual who is seeking 
employment or is employed as a driver of a commercial vehicle, 
an individual who has applied for, or has received an airman's 
medical certificate, an individual who is seeking employment or 
is employed as an operator of a locomotive, and a holder of, or 
applicant for, a merchant mariner's license, certificate of 
registry, or merchant mariner's document.
      Subsection (b) of this section amends section 30305 of 
title 49, United States Code, to allow Coast Guard military 
personnel to request the chief licensing official of a State to 
provide information in the National Driver Register about the 
individual to the Commandant of the Coast Guard, and to allow 
the Commandant to receive the information.
      Section 204 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate bill.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

              section 208. coast guard housing authorities

      Section 209 of the Senate bill establishes a new 
financing mechanism for the construction of military family 
housing and unaccompanied housing units on or near Coast Guard 
installations. It authorizes the Coast Guard to use direct 
loans, loan guarantees, long-term leases, rental guarantees, 
barter, direct government investment, and other financial 
arrangements to encourage private sector participation in the 
building of military housing.
      A Coast Guard Housing Improvement Fund (Fund) is 
established to provide these new housing projects. In addition 
to the amounts appropriated to the Fund, the Fund may receive 
transfers from other U.S. Department of Transportation housing 
accounts, receipts from property sales and rents, returns on 
any capital, and other income operations or transactions 
connected with the program. The amounts in the Fund are 
available to acquire housing using the various techniques 
mentioned above, but the total value of budget authority for 
all contracts and investments are limited to $60 million.
      The House amendment has no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute amends the Senate provision in 
several ways. The substitute allows the Coast Guard Housing 
program to use loan guarantees for developers of military 
family housing and military unaccompanied housing. The 
substitute also allows the Secretary of Transportation to enter 
into limited partnerships with nongovernmental entities for the 
purpose of carrying out projects for the acquisition or 
construction of housing units for military housing.
      Section 208 of the Conference Substitute ensures that 
amounts available from the Fund are subject to appropriations. 
This provision does not allow the acquisition or construction 
of military housing unless the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate have 
adopted resolutions approving of the plans. The conferees 
believe the Coast Guard should submit to each committee a 
prospectus for each project based on OMB Circular A-104, which 
is used by the General Services Administration for their 
capital construction and leasing program. Section 208 
identifies one housing project on or near Coast Guard 
Integrated Support Command, Ketchikan, Alaska, to be exempted 
from the committee approval process.

     section 209. board for correction of military records deadline

      Section 210 of the Senate bill is similar to section 404 
of the House amendment, except that it requires those affected 
by the provision to apply for retroactive relief.
      Section 404 of the House amendment clarifies the 
application of section 212 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act 
of 1989, (Public Law 101-225, 10 U.S.C. 1552 note). This 
section required the Secretary of Transportation to amend the 
regulations governing the Coast Guard's Board for the 
Correction of Military Records (BCMR) to ensure that appeals 
are processed expeditiously and that final decisions are made 
within 10 months of their receipt by the BCMR. Section 212 also 
required the Secretary to appoint and maintain a permanent 
staff, and a panel of civilian officers or employees to serve 
as members of the board, which are adequate to ensure 
compliance with the 10-month deadline for final action on the 
application. Section 404 of the House amendment clarifies that 
the 10-month deadline established under section 212 of the 1989 
Coast Guard Authorization Act was intended to be mandatory. 
Section 404 also clarifies that section 212 was intended to 
apply to applications pending before the BCMR or the Secretary 
of Transportation on June 12, 1990, which was six months after 
the date of enactment of the 1989 Coast Guard Authorization 
Act.
      Under section 404 of the House amendment, and section 212 
of the 1989 Coast Guard Authorization Act, extensions of time 
granted to applicants by the BCMR do not count toward the 10-
month deadline. The purpose of section 212 of the 1989 Coast 
Guard Authorization Act was to impose a deadline on the 
Department of Transportation that resulted in timely, 
meaningful resolution of claims for BCMR applicants. Extensions 
of the 10-month deadline requested by applicants themselves are 
not contrary to the purpose of section 212.
      Section 209 of the Conference substitute creates a new 
section 425 of title 46, United States Code, which is similar 
to the Senate provision. The conferees believe that the lack of 
prompt resolution of BCMR cases has denied meaningful relief to 
many BCMR applicants who are found to have been unjustly passed 
over for promotion. Because the Coast Guard does not convene 
special selection boards for officers whom the BCMR finds to 
have been wrongly passed over, it is imperative that the BCMR 
adhere to the 10-month deadline in each case. Officers who fall 
behind the regular promotion cycle because of delayed BCMR 
relief are at a competitive disadvantage when competing for 
promotion against officers whose careers have progressed at a 
normal pace.
      The conferees direct the BCMR to resolve all cases within 
the 10-month deadline, eliminating the necessity for Coast 
Guard special selection boards. The conferees also direct the 
BCMR to establish a system to monitor the implementation of 
this section, including a method to easily determine the dates 
on which applications are filed with the BCMR, and other 
significant dates related to a BCMR application.

      section 210. repeal temporary promotion of warrant officers

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute repeals section 277 of title 
14, United States Code, which provides that Coast Guard warrant 
officers may be temporarily promoted to higher warrant officer 
grades. Section 541 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337) made the Warrant 
Officer Management Act (WOMA) applicable to the Coast Guard 
warrant officer corps. There are no temporary warrant officer 
promotions under WOMA and the repeal of section 277 of title 
14, United States Code, is necessary to remove this 
inconsistent provision.

             section 211. appointment of temporary officers

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute permits the Coast Guard to 
vacate the appointments of a temporary commissioned officer at 
any point prior to the officer's becoming a permanent 
commissioned officer and not just during the period of the 
original appointment. This provides an important means for 
managing the size of the Coast Guard officer corps in an era of 
decreasing budgets, while at the same time allowing individuals 
to continue a Coast Guard career.

  section 212. information to be provided to officer selection boards

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute deletes the requirement for the 
Coast Guard to identify officers who are in the promotion zone 
of the group. This will allow officers who have failed to be 
selected for promotion by an earlier board to compete on an 
equal basis with officers who are being considered for the 
first time.

 section 213. rescue diver training for selected coast guard personnel

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute allows the Coast Guard to 
provide rescue diver training to selected Coast Guard personnel 
under the helicopter rescue swimming program.

         section 214. special authorities regarding coast guard

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adds two provisions which 
involve Coast Guard reimbursement of expenses for mess 
operations and severable services contracts.
        Subsection (a) of section 214 allows the Secretary of 
Transportation, when the Coast Guard is not operating as part 
of the Navy, to establish rates for meals sold at Coast Guard 
dining facilities and to reimburse mess expense operations for 
the cost of those meals. This will allow the Coast Guard to 
operate its mess facilities more efficiently and effectively, 
in the same manner as the other armed services, which already 
have this authority.
      Subsection (b) of section 214 allows the Secretary of 
Transportation to enter into contracts for severable services 
contracts across fiscal years. Severable services are services 
funded by annual appropriations that can be subdivided by year 
for performance, such as services performed for equipment and 
facility maintenance. This provision gives the Coast Guard the 
same authority previously granted to other Federal agencies 
under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.

       Title III--Marine Safety and Waterway Services Management

               section 301. changes to documentation laws

      Section 301 of the Senate bill amends section 12122(a) of 
title 46, United States Code, increasing the maximum civil 
penalty for violation of documentation laws from $500 to 
$10,000.
      Subsection (b) of this section amends section 12122(b) of 
title 46, United States Code, broadening the seizure and 
forfeiture authority within the penalty section. This 
subsection moves three existing authorities currently in 
section 12110(c) of title 46, United States Code, to section 
12122(b). Consolidating these authorities in this section 
should clarify those violations of U.S. documentation laws for 
which seizure and forfeiture authority would be exercised.
      In addition, this subsection adds a new substantive basis 
for seizure and forfeiture when a vessel is placed under the 
command of a person not a citizen of the United States. The 
term ``under the command of'' is intended to have the same 
meaning as in section 12110(d) of title 46, United States Code. 
Command of a vessel would include, complete authority and 
control over and responsibility for: all aspects of vessel 
navigation, stability, cargo loading, and communications; 
material condition of the vessel; health, welfare, safety, and 
training of the crews; fishing and fish processing activities; 
crew hiring, firing, discipline, and pay; maintenance, 
provisioning, and supplies; and compliance with all applicable 
U.S. laws and regulations.
      Section 301 (c) and (d) makes technical and conforming 
changes to sections 12122(c) and 12110(d) of title 46, United 
States Code. Section 301(e) terminates the eligibility for a 
fisheries endorsement of a vessel purchased by the Secretary of 
Commerce under a fishing capacity reduction program.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision 
with several technical modifications.

           section 302. nondisclosure of port security plans

        Section 302 of the Senate bill amends section 7 of the 
Ports and Waterways Safety Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1226), to 
exempt information regarding passenger vessels or terminal 
security plans established by the Coast Guard from the public 
disclosure requirements of any law. Currently, airline and 
security plans developed by the Federal Aviation Administration 
are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information 
Act. Section 302 of this bill extends the same degree of 
protection to Coast Guard security plans for passenger vessels 
and terminals to ensure that safety and security are not 
compromised at these facilities.
      Section 306 of the House amendment contains a provision 
identical to the Senate bill.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

  section 303. maritime drug and alcohol testing program civil penalty

        Section 303 of the Senate bill amends chapter 21 of 
title 46, United States Code, to provide for a civil penalty of 
not more than $1,000 per day for marine employees who violate 
the Coast Guard's chemical testing regulations.
      Section 307 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                section 304. renewal of advisory groups

      Section 304 of the Senate bill amends sections 18 and 19 
of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-
241, 105 Stat. 2208-2235) to extend the termination dates for 
the Houston-Galveston Navigation Safety Advisory Committee and 
the Lower Mississippi River Waterway Advisory Committee until 
September 30, 2000. This section also amends section 5(d) of 
the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (33 U.S.C. 2073) and 
section 4508(e)(1) of title 46, United States Code, to extend 
the termination dates for the Navigation Safety Advisory 
Council and the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Advisory 
Committee, respectively, until September 30, 2000. The section 
further extends the Towing Safety Advisory Committee until 
September 30, 2000.
      Sections 303, 304, 305, and 311 of the House amendment 
also extend the termination dates for these organizations. The 
House amendment amends section 5(d) of the Inland Navigational 
Rules Act of 1980 (33 U.S.C. 2073) to change the name of the 
Rules of the Road Advisory Council to the Navigational Safety 
Advisory Council.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision 
with the House provision related to the Navigation Safety 
Advisory Council. The substitute also extends the statutory 
authority for the National Boating Safety Advisory Council 
until September 30, 2000.

        section 305. electronic filing of commercial instruments

      Section 305 of the Senate bill amends section 31321(a) of 
title 46, United States Code, to allow the public to file a 
bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or related 
instrument with the Coast Guard electronically. Under the 
amendments made by this section, the original instrument must 
be provided to the Secretary of Transportation within 10 days 
after the electronic transfer.
      Section 403 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                      section 306. civil penalties

      Section 306(a) of the Senate bill amends section 6103(a) 
of title 46, United States Code, to increase the civil penalty 
against an owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, 
or individual in charge of a vessel for failure to report a 
vessel casualty from $1,000 to not more than $25,000. Section 
306(b) amends section 8906 of title 46, United States Code, to 
increase the civil penalty against an owner, charterer, 
managing operator, agent, master, or individual in charge of a 
vessel operated in violation of small vessel operator licensing 
requirements, from $1,000 to not more than $25,000.
      Section 309 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

      section 307. amendment to require epirbs on the great lakes

      Section 307 of the Senate bill amends paragraph 7 of 
section 4502(a) of title 46, United States Code, to require 
uninspected commercial fishing vessels operating beyond three 
nautical miles from the coastline of the Great Lakes to carry 
emergency position indicating radio beacons (EPIRBS).
      Section 310 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

              section 308. report on loran-c requirements

      Section 308 of the Senate bill requires the Secretary of 
Transportation, in consultation with users of the LORAN-C radio 
navigation system, to submit a report on the future use of and 
funding for operations, maintenance, and upgrades of the LORAN-
C radionavigation system as satellite based technology becomes 
the sole means of safe and efficient navigation.
      This section specifically requires the Secretary to 
address several issues in the report. These include determining 
an appropriate timetable for transitioning from ground-based 
radio navigation technology, and the possible need for all 
agencies in the Department of Transportation, as well as other 
government beneficiaries, to share in the Federal government's 
costs related to LORAN-C technology.
      Section 415 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision. 
The LORAN-C radionavigation system has been operated as a cost-
effective, proven, reliable system for millions of marine and 
other users over the years which provides an important 
enhancement to user safety. In recent years, numerous steps 
have been taken to emphasize that the Coast Guard and other 
agencies in the Department of Transportation should take 
advantage of the compatibility of LORAN with GPS technology so 
that the substantial investment made by users can continue to 
be utilized until satellite technology is available as a sole 
means of navigation. The Conferees have heard from every 
segment of the LORAN user community, expressing strong support 
for continued funding and upgrade of the LORAN infrastructure. 
Therefore, the Conferees have included a provision requiring 
the Secretary within 180 days to provide a plan for the future 
funding and upgrade of the Loran system and infrastructure.

                    section 309. small boat stations

      Section 309 in the Senate bill prohibits the Secretary of 
Transportation from closing any Coast Guard multi-mission small 
boat station or subunit before October 1, 1996. Section 309 
prohibits the Coast Guard from closing any Coast Guard small 
boat station or subunit after October 1, 1996 unless he 
certifies that the closure will not result in the degradation 
of services that would cause a significantly increased threat 
to life, property, the environment, public safety, or our 
national security. The Secretary must also notify the public of 
the intended closure, make available to the public information 
used in making the determination and assessment under this 
section, and provide an opportunity for public meetings and 
written comments about the closure.
      Section 104 of the House amendment prohibits the closure 
of Coast Guard multimission small boat stations unless the 
Secretary of Transportation determines that maritime safety 
will not be diminished by the closures.
      The Conference substitute also adds a new section 673 to 
title 14, United States Code, which requires that Coast Guard 
small boat stations maintain at least one vessel capable of 
performing off-shore rescue operations.
      The Conference substitute adds a new section 674 to title 
14, United States Code, which prevents the Secretary of 
Transportation closing a Coast Guard multi-mission small boat 
station unless the Secretary determines that the remaining 
search and rescue capabilities maintain the safety of the 
maritime public in the area of the station or subunit. The 
Secretary must also determine that the regional or local 
prevailing weather and marine conditions, including water 
temperature or unusual tide and current conditions, do not 
require continued operation of the search and rescue station. 
The Secretary must further determine that the Coast Guard 
search and rescue standards related to search and rescue 
response times are met. The Secretary must provide an 
opportunity for public comment and meetings in regard to any 
proposed station closure.

     section 310. penalty for alteration of marine safety equipment

      Section 310 of the Senate bill broadens section 3318 of 
title 46, United States Code, to classify as a felony the 
knowing alteration of lifesaving, fire fighting, and other 
marine safety equipment, if the alteration results in equipment 
that is insufficient to accomplish the purpose for which it is 
intended.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate bill with an 
amendment establishing a criminal penalty applicable commercial 
alteration or servicing which intentionally renders the 
equipment unsafe and unfit for the purpose for which it is 
intended.

section 311. prohibition on overhaul, repair, and maintenance of coast 
                   guard vessels in foreign shipyards

      Section 311 of the Senate bill amends chapter 5 of title 
14, United States Code, to require that all non-emergency 
repairs of Coast Guard vessels be conducted in shipyards 
located in the United States. This provision is similar to the 
current restrictions on the repair of U.S. Navy vessels.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute amends the Senate provision to 
exempt voyage repairs and vessels that are home ported outside 
a U.S. State from this section.

section 312. withholding vessel clearance for violation of certain acts

      Section 312 of the Senate bill authorizes the Secretary 
of the Treasury, at the request of the Secretary of 
Transportation, to refuse or revoke a vessel's clearance, when 
that vessel is liable, or reasonable cause exists to believe 
that the vessel is liable, to the United States Government for 
certain civil or criminal penalties. Under the amendments made 
by this section, the Secretary of the Treasury may grant a 
clearance previously refused or revoked only if the owner of 
the vessel obtains a bond or other surety satisfactory to the 
Secretary of Transportation to cover the amount of the 
potential fine or penalty assessment.
      Section 312(a) amends section 5122 of title 49, United 
States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Treasury to refuse 
or revoke a vessel's clearance for violations of chapter 51 of 
title 49, United States Code, formerly the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act. Chapter 51 of title 49 applies to all 
vessels that transport, ship, maintain, or manufacture 
hazardous materials in waters subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States.
      Section 312(b) amends section 13(f) of the Ports and 
Waterways Safety Act (33 U.S.C. 1232(f)) to authorize the 
Secretary of the Treasury to refuse or revoke a vessel's 
clearance for violations of that Act. The Ports and Waterways 
Safety Act promotes port and merchant vessel safety through the 
establishment of vessel traffic service systems and the 
requirement to carry certain navigation equipment aboard 
vessels in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States.
      Section 312(c) amends section 4(d) of the Inland 
Navigational Rules Act of 1980 (33 U.S.C. 2072(d)) to authorize 
the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse or revoke a vessel's 
clearance for violations of that Act. The Inland Navigational 
Rules Act governs the ``rules of the road'' for vessel 
navigation for the various inland, Great Lakes, and Western 
Rivers waters.
      Section 312(d) amends section 3718(e) of title 46, United 
States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Treasury to refuse 
or revoke a vessel's clearance for violations of chapter 37 of 
title 46, United States Code, governing the carriage of liquid 
bulk dangerous cargoes in the navigable waters or a port of 
place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
      Section 308 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

          SECTION 313. INFORMATION BARRED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      Section 414 of the House amendment adds a new section to 
chapter 63 of title 46, United States Code, to limit the use of 
certain portions of formal and informal marine casualty 
investigations in civil judicial, administrative, and state 
criminal proceedings unless the Secretary of Transportation 
consents to releasing the report. The section would also 
prohibit any employee of the United States or member of the 
Coast Guard investigating a marine casualty or assisting in any 
such investigation being subject to deposition or other 
discovery, or to otherwise testify or give information in such 
proceedings relevant to a marine casualty investigation without 
the consent of the Secretary. New section 6308 also clarifies 
that the restriction on the use of the portions of 
investigations is not an admission of liability by the United 
States or by a person referred to in the investigation.
      Although there are certain statutory and discovery 
provisions that presently protest parts of an investigation 
from use in civil and state criminal proceedings, there is no 
statutory prohibition on the use of opinions, recommendations, 
deliberations, and conclusions contained in marine casualty 
investigation reports.
      The Conference substitute alters the House provision to 
completely prohibit a report of a Coast Guard marine casualty 
investigation from being admissible as evidence or subject to 
discovery in any civil or administrative proceedings, other 
than an administrative proceeding initiated by the United 
States. The substitute also prohibits any employee of the 
United States or member of the Coast Guard investigating a 
marine casualty from being subject to deposition or other 
discovery without the permission and consent of the Secretary 
of Transportation. The Secretary may not withhold permission 
for the employee or member to testify on solely factual matters 
where the information is not available elsewhere.

                 SECTION 314. MARINE CASUALTY REPORTING

      Section 503(a) of the Senate bill requires the Coast 
Guard to submit a plan to Congress to increase the reporting of 
vessel accidents to appropriate state law enforcement 
officials.
      Section 503(b) amends section 6130(a) of title 46, United 
States Code, to establish a $1,000 civil penalty for an owner, 
charterer, operator, agent, master, or individual in charge of 
a vessel who has failed to submit a marine casualty report to 
state authorities as required under existing law.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference adopts the Senate provision.

                    Title IV--Coast Guard Auxiliary

        SECTION 401. ADMINISTRATION OF THE COAST GUARD AUXILIARY

      Section 401 of the Senate bill amends section 821 of 
title 14, United States Code, to establish an organizational 
structure for the Coast Guard Auxiliary and to designate the 
Auxiliary as an ``Instrumentality of the United States'' only 
with respect to acts or omissions committed by Auxiliary 
members performing a Coast Guard function or operation 
authorized by the Commandant of the Coast Guard, under section 
822 of title 14, United States Code. Instrumentality status 
will allow the U.S. Government to provide legal representation 
and indemnification for the Auxiliary in litigation in which 
the Auxiliary is a defendant.
      Instrumentality status will also protect Auxiliary assets 
and members from liability in the event of alleged tortious 
conduct committed by members while acting within the scope of 
their official duties. The liability protection provided to the 
Auxiliary under this section is for noncontractual civil tort 
liability.
      Section 401 of the Senate bill also authorizes the 
national board of the Auxiliary, Auxiliary districts, and 
regions of the Auxiliary to incorporate under state law in 
accordance with policies established by the Commandant. The 
ability to incorporate will allow the Auxiliary's national 
board to manage its finances more effectively and to hold 
Auxiliary copyrights, trademarks, and title to property used by 
the Auxiliary in performing its missions. Regional or district 
corporations may be formed under this section only for the 
purpose of holding property for Auxiliary use. Corporations 
formed under this authority are not considered 
instrumentalities of the United States.
      Section 801 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

           section 402. purpose of the coast guard auxiliary

      Section 402 of the Senate bill provides that the purpose 
of the Coast Guard Auxiliary is to assist the Coast Guard as 
authorized by the Commandant, in performing any Coast Guard 
function, power, duty, role, mission, or operation authorized 
by law. As the functions and operations of the Coast Guard 
expand in future years, the Auxiliary will have the flexibility 
to act in support of Coast Guard operations, under the 
direction of the Commandant. Future uses of the Coast Guard 
Auxiliary may include the establishment and support of marine 
safety and security zones; port and harbor patrols; parade and 
regatta patrols; pollution patrols; transportation of Coast 
Guard personnel for mission support; training support; and 
other support missions authorized by the Commandant.
      Section 802 of the House amendment is similar to this 
provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

             section 403. members of the auxiliary; status

      Seciton 403 of the Senate bill clarifies the status of 
individual members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and affords an 
Auxiliarist, while acting within the scope of official duties, 
the same degree of protection from legal liability as is 
provided to Coast Guard personnel. Under section 403, Auxiliary 
members are considered Federal employees for limited purposes, 
and are protected under the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. 
2671 et seq.) from the claims of a third party who is allegedly 
harmed by the Auxiliary member while the member is acting 
within the scope of official duties.
      Section 803 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

           SECTION 404. ASSIGNMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF DUTIES

      Section 404 of the Senate bill deletes the antiquated 
term ``specific duties'' from sections 830, 831, and 832 of 
title 14, United States Code.
      Section 804 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

SECTION 405. COOPERATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES, STATES, TERRITORIES, AND 
                         POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS

      Section 405 of the Senate bill allows the Commandant to 
prescribe conditions under which the Coast Guard Auxiliary may 
assist the States, when requested by proper State authorities. 
Assistance provided under this section may include supporting 
and augmenting state safety and security patrols for boat 
parades, regattas, and other special waterborne events.
      Section 805 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

                SECTION 406. VESSEL DEEMED PUBLIC VESSEL

      Section 406 of the Senate bill clarifies that an 
Auxiliary vessel, while assigned to authorized Coast Guard 
duty, is deemed to be a public vessel of the United States and 
a vessel of the Coast Guard within the meaning of sections 646 
and 647 of title 14, United States Code, and other applicable 
provisions of law, for purposes of resolving third-party claims 
for damage.
      Section 806 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

              SECTION 407. AIRCRAFT DEEMED PUBLIC AIRCRAFT

      Section 407 of the Senate bill clarifies that an 
Auxiliary aircraft, while assigned to authorized Coast Guard 
duty, is deemed to be a Coast Guard aircraft, a public aircraft 
of the United States, and an aircraft of the Coast Guard for 
purposes of resolving third-party claims for damage. This 
section also deems Auxiliary pilots to be Coast Guard pilots 
while assigned to Coast Guard duty.
      Section 807 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

               section 408. disposal of certain material

      Section 408 of the Senate bill allows the Auxiliary to 
acquire directly obsolete or other material that is not needed 
by the Coast Guard, in those states where unincorporated 
associations may do so, or indirectly, through a corporation 
formed for purposes of acquiring, owning, and disposing of 
property.
      Section 808 of the House bill is similar to the Senate 
provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

                 Title V--Deepwater Port Modernization

      Title V of the Senate bill contains provisions to: (1) 
ensure funding for state recreational boating safety grants; 
(2) improve boating access; and (3) establish age requirements 
for personal flotation devices.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute includes the Deepwater Port 
Modernization Act with the following provisions:

                        section 501. short title

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.

Act''.

            section 502. declarations of purpose and policy

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute states that this provision's 
overall purpose is to promote greater construction and use of 
deepwater ports by improving the statutory and regulatory 
framework under which deepwater ports operate. This title 
streamlines governmental regulation so as to address legitimate 
public concerns, including safety and minimizing risks to the 
environment, without subjecting deepwater ports to unduly 
burdensome, unnecessary or duplicative regulations or licensing 
provisions.

                        section 503. definitions

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute amends certain definitions in 
the Deepwater Ports Act of 1974 (DWPA) (33 U.S.C. 1502 et 
seq.).

                         Section 504. licenses

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute restructures the current three-
tiered approach of licensing, operations manuals, and 
regulations into an approach that relies on licenses and 
operations manuals. However, the provision preserves the use of 
regulations for basic standards and conditions.

                   section 505. informational filings

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.

                     section 602. safety management

      Section 602 of the Senate bill adds a new chapter 32 to 
title 46, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of 
Transportation to prescribe regulations regarding shipboard and 
shorebased management of vessels and personnel. This authority 
would include conducting examinations and requiring the 
maintenance of records. The purpose of this section is to 
implement the International Safety Management (ISM) Code. This 
agreement, which the United States Government has signed, 
requires owners of vessels engaged in foreign commerce to 
manage their vessels in a safe manner. The Secretary currently 
lacks legal authority to require adoption and use of the ISM 
Code by the owners and operators of U.S.-flag vessels.
      Section 502 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

 section 603. use of reports, documents, records, and examinations of 
                             other persons

      Section 603 of the Senate bill adds a new section 3103 to 
title 46, United States Code. This new section will allow the 
Secretary to use reports, documents, and certificates issued by 
persons that the Secretary decides may be relied on to inspect, 
examine, or survey vessels.
      Section 503 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                    section 604. equipment approval

      Section 604 of the Senate bill amends section 3306 of 
title 46, United States Code, concerning vessel inspection 
regulations and equipment and material approvals. Subsection 
(b)(1) contains the same language as the current section 
3306(b), except that the language has been broadened to 
specifically include material subject to regulation. This term 
is added for clarification only.
      Section 504 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                  section 605. frquently of inspection

      Section 605 of the Senate bill amends section 3307(l) of 
title 45, United States Code, to clarify its purpose and to 
change the period of validity for certificates of inspection 
from two to five years. No practical changes will result with 
respect to inspection and examinations that are the basis for 
issuing the certificates of inspection.
      Section 505 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                 section 606. certificate of inspection

      Section 606 of the Senate bill eliminates the prohibition 
of a vessel owner from scheduling an inspection for a vessel 
more than 60 days in advance of the inspection. This change 
will allow shipowners to request inspections more than 60 days 
prior to the expiration of the current certificate of 
inspection.
      Section 506 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

  SECTION 607. DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY TO CLASSIFICATION 
                               SOCIETIES

      Section 607 of the Senate bill amends section 3316 of 
title 46, United States Code, concerning the use of 
classification societies to inspect vessels. Currently, section 
3316 limits delegations to the American Bureau of Shipping 
(ABS) ``or a similar United States classification society.'' 
Since there is no similar U.S. classification society, there 
is, in effect, no delegation under this section other than to 
ABS.
      Section 507 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

             Title VII--Technical and Conforming Amendments

           SECTION 701. AMENDMENT OF INLAND NAVIGATION RULES

      Section 701 of the Senate bill adopts the Navigation 
Safety Advisory Council's (NAVSAC) recommendations for changing 
a number of the Inland Navigational Rules (Inland Rules) (33 
U.S.C. 2001-2071). These changes to the Inland Rules help 
clarify ambiguities in the practical application of the Rules, 
as well as to bring them into closer conformity with the 
International Regulations of Preventing Collisions at Sea 
(COLREGS), (33 U.S.C. 1602). The Coast Guard agrees with the 
recommendations of NAVSAC and has proposed amendments to Inland 
Rules 9, 15, 23, 24, 26, and 34.
      Section 701 of the House amendment is identical.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

    sections 702-744. Establishment of alternate convention tonnage

      Section 702-744 of the Senate bill authorize the 
Secretary of Transportation to establish alternate 
International Tonnage Convention (ITC) tonnage requirements for 
the purposes of statutes that contain vessel tonnage 
thresholds. Tonnage thresholds in existing statutes are based 
on the regulatory measurement system under chapter 145 of title 
46, United States Code, which allows vessel designers to use 
tonnage reduction techniques to artificially lower the tonnage 
of a vessel. Since the ITC measurement system, implemented 
under chapter 143 of title 46, United States Code, became 
effective for the United States on July 18, 1984, statutory 
tonnage limits have not been revised to reflect the higher 
tonnages that often result when a vessel is measured under the 
ITC system. The availability of alternate ITC tonnages 
established by the Secretary will discourage vessel designers 
and operators from using the regulatory measurement system to 
comply with existing statutory and regulatory requirements to 
maintain their competitive viability. Alternate ITC tonnages 
will give the maritime industry the flexibility to build and 
operate vessels that do not employ tonnage reduction 
techniques, resulting in safer and more efficient vessels. 
Alternate tonnages will also enable U.S. vessel designers and 
operators to be competitive in the international market.
      Sections 702 through 744 authorize the Secretary of 
Transportation to establish alternate ITC tonnage thresholds 
for the purposes of each of the statutes amended. Under the 
amendments made by these sections, vessel owners have the 
option to measure their vessels under the new ITC tonnage 
system or the regulatory system. The Committee expects that 
owners of many existing vessels, and virtually all owners of 
vessels constructed in the future, will exercise this option, 
leading ultimately to the demise of the antiquated regulatory 
measurement system. However, the amendments made by sections 
702-744 do not effect the option of an ``existing vessel'' as 
defined in section 14101(2) of title 46, United States Code, to 
retain its regulatory tonnage measurement as provided in 
section 14301(d) of that title.
      Finally, sections 702-744 authorize the Secretary to 
establish an alternate regulatory tonnage for the purposes of 
statutes enacted after July 18, 1994, that apply the ITC 
system. Alternate regulatory tonnages must be established to 
allow vessels entitled to use the regulatory tonnage 
measurement system to comply with laws enacted after July 18, 
1994.
      Sections 702-744 of the House amendment are similar to 
the Senate provisions.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provisions 
with several amendments.
      The Conferees have included a sentence in proposed 
section 14104(b) of title 46, U.S. Code, that states that the 
regulations prescribing alternate tonnages would be 
interpretative regulations. The Conferees consider them to be 
interpretative in that the action the Coast Guard is required 
to take under this section is to interpret what the threshold 
tonnage for application of the current shipping laws to a class 
of vessels, which is currently based on regulatory tonnage, 
would be under the International Tonnage Convention (ITC). 
Because these regulations would be interpretative, under the 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.), the 
notice of proposed rulemaking and comment requirements and the 
30 day effective date delay of section 553 of the APA would not 
be required. Therefore the Conferees believe that these 
interpretative regulations should be able to be prescribed 
expeditiously.

    section 745. convention tonnage for licenses, certificates, and 
                               documents

      Section 745 of the Senate bill amends chapter 75 of title 
46, United States Code, by adding a new section 7506 to 
authorize the Secretary to evaluate the service of an 
individual applying for a license, certificate of registry, or 
merchant mariners document based on the size of the vessel on 
which the individual served as measured under the International 
Tonnage Convention (chapter 143, title 46, United States Code). 
Eligibility of individuals for licenses, certificates of 
registry, and merchant mariners' documents issued by the 
Secretary is based, in part, on the size of the vessel on which 
the individual has experience.
      Section 747 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                   section 746. technical corrections

      Section 746 of the Senate bill is a technical amendment 
to chapter 121 and corrects two misspelled words in chapter 131 
of title 46, United States Code.
      Section 745 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision, 
with an amendment regarding the FMC's authority over cruise 
ship bonding regulations. Public Law 89-777, 80 Stat 1356 
(November 6, 1966) requires the owners or charterers of certain 
passenger vessels to establish their financial responsibility 
for death or injury to passengers or for nonperformance of a 
voyage. Section 2(d) of Pub. L. 89-777 states in part:

            The provisions of the Shipping Act, 1916, shall 
        apply with respect to proceedings conducted by the 
        Commission under this section.

Consequently, since 1966, the Federal Maritime Commission has 
used provisions of the Shipping Act, 1916 (``1916 Act'') to 
administer its responsibilities under Pub. L. 89-777, including 
enforcement of the bond requirements. However, recent 
legislative changes to the Interstate Commerce Commission 
(``ICC'') may have inadvertently affected the FMC's ability to 
continue to employ the 1916 Act to conduct proceedings under 
Pub. L. 89-777. The Conference substitute corrected this by 
allowing the 1984 Act authority to be used in lieu of the 
identical 1916 Act authority.

        section 747. technical corrections to references to icc

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute amends section 27 of the 
Merchant Marine Act, 1920, to replace the reference to the 
``Interstate Commerce Commission'' with its successor, the 
``Surface Transportation Board.''

                    Title VIII--Pollution From Ships

            SECTION 801. PREVENTION OF POLLUTION FROM SHIPS

      Section 801 of the Senate bill amends section 6 of the 
Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) to require that the 
Secretary of Transportation inspect waste reception facilities 
prior to issuing a certificate of adequacy, and would provide 
for automatic expiration of certificates after five years, or 
sooner if there is a change in operator or if the certificate 
is suspended or revoked. In addition, this section would 
encourage public participation by making available a current 
list of certificates of status at ports and by requiring that 
ports post placards containing telephone numbers where citizens 
can call to report inadequate reception facilities.
      The House amendment has no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

       SECTION 802. MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION RESEARCH AND CONTROL

      Section 802(a) of the Senate bill amends section 2201(a) 
of the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 
1987 (MPPRCA) (33 U.S.C. 1902 note) to extend indefinitely the 
requirement that the Secretary report to Congress biennially on 
compliance with MARPOL Annex V. This subsection would also 
require that a list of enforcement actions taken against any 
domestic or foreign ship pursuant to APPS be published in the 
Register on an annual basis.
      Section 802(b) amends section 2203 of the MPPRCA to: (1) 
establish a Marine Debris Coordinating Committee; and (2) 
direct the Environmental Protection Agency and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to use the marine debris 
data collected under title V of MPPRCA to assist that Committee 
in ensuring coordination of research, monitoring, education, 
and regulatory actions and assist the Coast Guard in assessing 
the effectivenes of MPPRCA and APPS.
      Section 802(c) amends section 2204(a) of MPPRCA, 
extending indefinitely the authorization for cooperative public 
outreach and educational programs. This subsection also 
specifies activities that could be included in outreach 
programs and would require that such programs provide the 
public with information on how to report violations of the 
MPPRCA and APPS. In developing these programs, the Committee 
directs Federal agencies to consult with state or local 
agencies that have direct contact with recreational and 
commercial boaters. Finally, this subsection would authorize 
the Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency to 
award grants and enter into cooperative agreements for 
implementing public outreach programs.
      The House amendment has no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                     Title IX--Towing Vessel Safety

                          Title X--Conveyances

                section 1001. conveyance of lighthouses

      Section 1001(a)(3)(A) of the Senate bill authorizes the 
transfer of the Cape Ann Lighthouse and surrounding Coast Guard 
property located on Thachers Island, Massachusetts, to the Town 
of Rockport, Massachusetts. Section 1003 of the Senate bill 
authorizes the transfer of the property comprising Squirrel 
Point Light located in Arrowsic, Maine, to Squirrel Point 
Associates, Incorporated. Section 1004 of this bill authorizes 
the transfer of the property comprising Montauk Light Station 
located in Montauk, New York, to the Montauk Historical 
Association. Finally, Section 1005 of the Senate bill 
authorizes the transfer of the property comprising Point Arena 
Light Station located in Mendocino County, California to the 
Point Arena Lighthouse Keepers, Incorporated. In making these 
transfers, the United States would convey all right, title and 
interest, except that the Coast Guard retains ownership of any 
historic artifact. The conveyance of these properties is 
subject to the condition that the properties are maintained in 
a manner that ensures their present and future use for Coast 
Guard aids to navigation and is consistent with the provisions 
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1996. In addition, 
the Coast Guard continues to have access to the properties for 
the operation and maintenance of aids to navigation.
      Section 424 of the House amendment authorizes the 
transfer of the Cape Ann Lighthouse and section 423 of the 
House amendment authorizes the transfer Montauk Light Station.

The Conference substitute also transfers the Presque Isle Light 
Station, Michigan, to Presque Isle Township, Presque Isle 
County, Michigan, the Saint Helena Island Light Station to the 
Great Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association, and the Cove Point 
Light Station to Calvert County, Maryland. The conditions for 
the transfer of the property from the United States are similar 
to the conditions of the Senate provision.

    section 1002. conveyance of certain lighthouses located in maine

      Section 1002 of the Senate bill authorizes the transfer 
of lighthouse properties located in Maine to the Island 
Institute in Rockland, Maine, and four lighthouse properties 
located in Maine to the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service. In making the transfer of the 31 lighthouse properties 
to the Island Institute, the United States would convey all 
right, title and interest, except that the Coast Guard would 
retain ownership of any historic artifact from any of the 35 
lighthouses transferred under this section. The Island 
Institute is directed to further transfer 29 of the 31 
lighthouse properties it receives from the Coast Guard to 
eligible Federal agencies, Maine state or local government 
entities, nonprofit corporations, educational agencies, or 
community development organizations. The further conveyances by 
the Island Institute would be subject to approval by the Maine 
Lighthouse Selection Committee the members of which are to be 
appointed by the Secretary. The conveyance of the 35 lighthouse 
properties would be subject to the condition that the 
properties: (1) be used for educational, historic, 
recreational, cultural, and wildlife conservation programs for 
the general public and for other uses that the Secretary of 
Transportation determines are not inconsistent; and (2) are 
maintained in a manner that ensures their present and future 
use for Coast Guard aids to navigation and is consistent with 
the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act of 
1966 (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.). In addition, the Coast Guard 
would continue to have access to the properties for the 
operation and maintenance of aids to navigation.
      The House amendment does not contain a comparable 
provision.
      The Conference substitute amends the Senate proposal to 
require that the Secretary of Transportation to transfer 30 
Maine lighthouses to eligible entities recommended by the 
Island Institute, and approved by a Selection Committee. The 
lighthouses must be conveyed within two years of the Act's 
enactment. The substitute further authorizes the transfer of 
four lighthouses to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and two 
lighthouses directly to the Island Institute. The substitute 
identifies eligible entities for receipt of the 30 lighthouses 
and establishes a Maine Lighthouse Selection Committee to 
review and approve the lighthouse transfer recommendations of 
the Island Institute. The terms of all the lighthouse transfers 
are similar to the Senate provision's terms of conveyance.

                        Title XI--Miscellaneous

                  section 1101. florida avenue bridge

      Section 1101 of the Senate bill deems the drainage siphon 
adjacent to the Florida Avenue Bridge in New Orleans, 
Louisiana, to be an appurtenance of the bridge, pursuant to the 
Truman-Hobbs Act. In 1992, the Florida Avenue Bridge was 
declared to be an ``unreasonable obstruction to navigation'' 
under the Truman-Hobbs Act. Since that time, funds have been 
appropriated by Congress to commence planning and engineering 
for the replacement of the bridge.
      The Coast Guard has determined that the drainage siphon, 
which is connected to the bridge's southern fender, must be 
removed to widen the channel sufficiently and restore the 
necessary navigability for commercial vessels on the Gulf 
Intracoastal Waterway. By declaring the siphon an appurtenance, 
its removal qualifies for funding under the Truman-Hobbs Act.
      Section 302 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision. As 
a result of the enactment of this provision, and the 
appropriation of sufficient funds in the current Coast Guard 
budget, the conferees expect that the Coast Guard will initiate 
construction on the replacement Florida Avenue Bridge as soon 
as possible in FY 97. The hazardous conditions that exist as a 
result of the current bridge must be rectified without delay in 
order to ensure the free flow of commerce on the Industrial 
Canal in the Port of New Orleans.

               section 1102. oil spill recovery institute

      Section 1102 of the Senate bill authorizes the Prince 
William Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute (OSRI), which is 
authorized under section 5001 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 
to fund research using the interest earned on the $22.5 million 
it is authorized to spend from the Oil Spill Liability Trust 
Fund, which was transferred from the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Fund 
in December of 1994.
      This section also scales back the size of the OSRI 
Advisory Board from 18 members to 16 members.
      The House amendment has no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision 
with amendments.

              section 1103. limited double-hull exemptions

      Section 1103 of the Senate bill amends section 3703a of 
title 46, United States Code, to exempt certain vessels from 
the double-hull construction requirements of the Oil Pollution 
Act of 1990. This section exempts those double-hulled U.S.-flag 
vessels delivered before August 12, 1992, from the OPA 90 
double-hull requirements. This section also exempts barges of 
less than 1,500 gross tons that are primarily used to carry 
deck cargo and bulk fuel to Alaska Native villages from the OPA 
90 double-hull requirements. The section also exempts vessels 
in the National Defense Reserve Fleet from the double-hull 
requirements.
      Section 416 of the House amendment differs from the 
Senate provision by exempting all vessels, not just U.S.-flag 
vessels, equipped with a double-hull before August 12, 1992, 
from the OPA 90 double-hull requirements. The House bill also 
exempts Alaskan barges of less than 2,000 gross tons, rather 
than 1,500 gross tons, from the OPA 90 double-hull 
requirements.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision 
with several amendments.

                SECTION 1104. OIL SPILL RESPONSE VESSELS

      Section 1104(a) of the Senate bill amends section 2101 of 
title 46, United States Code, to define an ``oil spill response 
vessel'' (OSRV) as a vessel that is designated in its 
certificate of inspection as such a vessel, or that is adapted 
to respond to a discharge of oil or a hazardous material. Under 
the amendments made by this section, the Coast Guard is 
required to establish a new regulatory system for OSRVs.
      Section 1104(b) adds a new subsection (f) to section 3702 
of title 46, United States Code, to exempt OSRVs from the tank 
vessel requirements of chapter 37 of title 46, United States 
Code. Section 1104(b) also divides OSRVs into two distinct 
categories. The first category addresses dedicated response 
vessels which are used only in spill response related 
activities. These vessels are not certified for any other type 
of service other than response. This category includes barges 
which are not used for carriage of oil in bulk as cargo and in 
some cases will never contain oil. There is no tonnage limit in 
this category. The second category recognizes that some vessels 
are dual-certified. This category exempts vessels from tank 
vessel requirements only when designated in the certificate for 
inspection as a response vessel and only when actually engaged 
in spill response related activities. This category is limited 
to 500 gross tons.
      Section 1104(c) and 1104(d) amend sections 8104 and 8301 
of title 46, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of 
Transportation to prescribe watch standing and licensing 
requirements for OSRVs.
      Section 1104(e) amends the requirements for Merchant 
Mariner's Documents (MMDs) under section 8701 of title 46, 
United States Code, by providing the Secretary with the 
flexibility to prescribe which, if any, individuals onboard an 
OSRV should be required to hold an MMD.
      Section 1104(f) amends section 8905 of title 46, United 
States Code, to clarify that a person licensed to operate 
towing vessels should not be required to operate vessels 
engaged in oil spill response or training activities. 
Currently, section 8904 of title 46, United States Code, 
requires that a towing vessel that is at least 26 feet in 
length be operated by a licensed individual. These provisions 
are not intended to apply to vessels towing in an emergency or 
on an intermittent basis during oil spill response or training.
      Section 1104(g)) amends section 3301 of title 46, United 
States Code, to establish a new vessel inspection category for 
OSRVs.
      Section 417 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

          SECTION 1105. SERVICE IN CERTAIN SUITS IN ADMIRALTY

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute corrects the service of process 
provisions contained in the Suits in Admiralty Act, (46 App. 
U.S.C. Sec. 742). Those provisions are different from the 
service provision in Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Under the proposed amendments, the general service 
of process procedures in Civil Rule 4 would apply to all civil 
cases, including admiralty and non-admiralty cases.
      Section 742 was enacted before the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure were adopted, and there is no apparent remaining 
reason to treat suits in admiralty differently than other civil 
actions. Rule 4(i) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
currently governs service upon the United States in all other 
civil cases.
      The Conference substitute deletes the service of process 
provisions contained in the Suits in Admiralty Act, which are 
different from the service provisions in Rule 4 of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure. The general service of process 
procedures in Civil Rule 4 would apply to all civil cases, 
including admiralty and non-admiralty cases.

              SECTION 1106. AMENDMENTS TO THE JOHNSON ACT

      Section 1106 of the Senate bill resolves a conflict 
between certain Federal and state laws involving authorized 
gambling aboard cruise vessels. Section 1106 amends section 
5(b)(2) of the Act of January 2, 1951 (15 U.S.C. 1175(B)(2)), 
commonly referred to as the ``Johnson Act'', to prohibit a 
state from regulating gambling in international waters during 
the intrastate segment of a voyage that begins or ends in the 
same state or U.S. possession and is part of a voyage to 
another state or country. States may still regulate gambling in 
state waters, on ``voyages to nowhere,'' and on other state 
voyages. The section does not apply to a voyage within the 
boundaries of the State of Hawaii.
      Section 408 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate section 1106. In addition, section 425 of the House 
amendment amends the Johnson Act to allow the State of Indiana 
to permit gambling aboard vessels that begin voyages within the 
territorial waters of Indiana and that do not leave the 
territorial jurisdiction of that state.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision, 
with an amendment that allows gambling on vessels which provide 
sleeping accommodations for all of its passengers if the vessel 
is on a voyage (or the segment of a voyage) that is of at least 
60 hours and that includes a stop in Canada or in a State other 
than the State of Alaska and also includes stops in at least 2 
different ports in Alaska. The amendment only applies to 
traditional cruises, not so called ``cruises to nowhere''.

 section 1107. lower columbia river maritime fire and safety activities

      Section 1107 of the Senate bill authorizes the Secretary 
to expend out of amounts appropriated for the Coast Guard for 
fiscal year 1996 not more than $491,000 for lower Columbia 
River marine, fire, oil, and toxic spill response 
communications, training, equipment, and program administration 
activities conducted by the Maritime Fire and Safety 
Association.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute authorizes $940,000 to complete 
the activities of the Maritime Fire and Safety Association.

             SECTION 1108. OIL POLLUTION RESEARCH TRAINING

      Section 1108 of the Senate bill amends section 
7001(c)(2)(D) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to allow 
research and training to be conducted at the Center for Marine 
Training and Safety in Galveston, Texas, which is a Texas A&M 
University facility. Currently, OPA 90 authorizes oil pollution 
research and training on innovative oil pollution technology to 
be conducted using, as appropriate, the National Spill Control 
School in Corpus Christi, Texas, another Texas A&M University 
facility.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

section 1109. limitation on relocation of houston and galveston marine 
                             safety offices

      Section 1109 of the Senate bill prohibits the Secretary 
of Transportation from relocating the Coast Guard Marine Safety 
Offices in Galveston, Texas, and Houston, Texas. Nothing in 
this section prevents the consolidation of management functions 
of these Coast Guard authorities.
      Section 421 of the House amendment prohibits the 
consolidation and relocation of the Coast Guard Marine Safety 
Offices in Galveston, Texas, and Houston, Texas.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

             section 1110. uninspected fish tender vessels

      Section 1110 of the Senate bill clarifies section 3302 of 
title 46, United States Code, relating to the carriage of cargo 
in uninspected fish-tender vessels providing service outside 
the Aleutian trade geographic region. Section 3302(c)(3) of 
title 46, United States Code, permits uninspected fish-tender 
vessels of not more than 500 gross tons to carry: (1) cargo to 
or from a place in Alaska that does not receive weekly common 
carrier service by water from a place in the United States; or 
(2) cargo which is of the type not accepted by that common 
carrier service. The Coast Guard has interpreted this weekly 
common carrier test to apply only to general cargo. Section 
1110 applies the weekly common carrier service test to all 
cargo which is of the type accepted by common carriers. Such 
cargo includes frozen fish products, canning components, 
cardboard, salt, and other materials directly related to 
fishing or the preparation of fish.
      The House amendment has no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision 
with several amendments. The Conferees have sought to clarify 
the law governing the carriage of cargo for hire by uninspected 
fish tender vessels to ports in Alaska outside of the Aleutian 
trade geographic region. The Conferees agree that such 
uninspected vessels are to be limited to the carriage of 
proprietary cargo and any cargo of a type not accepted by 
common carriers to communities being served weekly by common 
carriers, and a definition of ``proprietary cargo'' has been 
provided in the statute. The Conferees understand that there is 
at least one company in Alaska which owns both uninspected 
tender vessels and a number of marine supply stores. These 
vessels are currently being used to carry retail marine 
supplies for the affiliated marine supply stores. The bill 
language is drafted to permit the proprietary carriage of the 
retail inventory for these affiliated marine supply stores by 
the uninspected tender vessels.

            section 1111. foreign passenger vessel user fees

      Section 1111 of the Senate bill authorizes the Coast 
Guard to collect user fees for the full cost of inspecting 
foreign passenger vessels. Section 3303(b) of title 46, United 
States Code, currently requires the Secretary of Transportation 
to collect the same fees for the inspection of foreign 
passenger vessels that a foreign country charges U.S. vessels 
at the ports of that country. Because the United States 
currently has no passenger vessels that call at foreign ports, 
the Coast Guard is prohibited from charging foreign passenger 
vessels fees to recover the costs of examining those vessels in 
U.S. ports. Section 1111 of this bill strikes subsection (b) of 
section 3303, title 46, United States Code, to allow the Coast 
Guard to collect user fees for examining foreign passenger 
vessels.
      Section 301 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

                  section 1112. coast guard user fees

      Section 1112 of the Senate bill sets upper limits on user 
fees of $300 annually for small passenger vessels under 65 feet 
in length and $600 annually for passenger vessels 65 feet or 
longer. In addition, section 1112 exempts publicly-owned 
ferries these fees.
      Section 431 of the House amendment prohibits the 
Secretary of Transportation from assessing or collecting a fee 
or charge from any ferry vessel.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision 
with a technical amendment.

                     section 1113. vessel financing

      Section 1113(a) of the Senate bill amends section 31322 
of title 46, United States Code, to broaden the categories of 
persons eligible to be mortgagees for U.S.-flag vessels without 
the approval of the Secretary.
      Section 1113(b) of the Senate bill amends section 31328 
of title 46, United States Code, to broaden the categories of 
persons eligible to act as trustees for ship mortgage purposes 
to include persons eligible to own a documented vessel under 
chapter 121 of the title.
      Section 1113(c) of the Senate bill differs from section 
409(d) of the House amendment in several important ways. The 
Senate section eliminates the citizenship requirement for 
leasing companies only when the leasing company is primarily 
engaged in leasing or other financing transactions. Section 
1113(c) further differs from the House amendment by not 
allowing vessels with coastwise fishery endorsements from using 
a foreign leasing agent.
      Section 409(a) of the House amendment amends section 
31322 of title 46, United States Code, to eliminate all 
restrictions on persons that may be a mortgagee for a U.S.-flag 
vessel. This amendment is intended to promote vessel financing.
      Section 409(b) of the House amendment repeals section 
31328 of title 46, United States Code, which provided for the 
establishment of Westhampton Trusts. This section is no longer 
needed since all restrictions on mortgagees have been 
eliminated.
      Section 409(c) of the House amendment makes conforming 
changes to section 9(c) of the Shipping Act, 1916, (46 App. 
U.S.C. 808) to eliminate the need to obtain permission from the 
Secretary before using a foreign mortgagees.
      Section 409(d) of the House amendment amends section 
12106 of title 46, United States Code, to promote lease 
financing for vessels engaged in the coastwise trade by 
eliminating citizenship requirements for leasing companies. 
Currently, there are no citizenship requirements on leasing 
companies that finance vessels that have Great Lakes or 
Registry endorsements. Section 409(d) will also allow these 
companies to finance vessels that have coastwise endorsements.
      Section 409(d) amends section 12106 of title 46, United 
States Code, to authorize the Secretary to issue coastwise 
endorsements for vessels owned by any leasing company that is 
eligible to own a documented vessel. However, if the leasing 
company is not a U.S. citizen under section 2 of the Shipping 
Act, 1916, the vessel may only be operated in the coastwise 
trade if the vessel is operated under a demise charter to a 
section 2 citizen for a period of at least three years. It is 
expected that most of the charters will be long-term charters. 
However, once the initial long-term charter has expired, the 
leasing company may find it necessary to enter into short-term 
charters until another long-term charter is obtained. The lease 
agreement need not remain in effect for the full three years if 
there is a default by the lessee or a casualty or other event 
where the lease might be terminated by the vessel owner or 
lessee prior to the expiration of that period.
      The Secretary of Transportation may also authorize leases 
for a period shorter than three years under appropriate 
circumstances such as when a vessel's remaining useful life 
would not support a lease of three years or to preserve the use 
or possession of the vessel. The section also provides that on 
termination of a demise charter, the coastwise endorsement may 
be continued for a period not to exceed six months on any terms 
and conditions that the Secretary may prescribe. This will 
allow the leasing company to move the vessel, maintain it, have 
it repaired, or layed-up, but does not allow the vessel to be 
used in the coastwise trade since it is not under a charter to 
a section 2 citizen.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House amendment with 
several amendments. The provision also requires the Department 
of Transportation to conduct a study on the methods for leasing 
and financing of vessels operating in the coastal trades of 
other countries and whether the laws of other countries provide 
reciprocity for U.S. banks, leasing companies or other 
financial institutions with respect to the new leasing 
provisions in this section.
      In 1988, Congress began easing the restrictions on 
persons that can be mortgagees for U.S.-flag vessels by 
eliminating all restrictions on mortgagees for recreational 
vessels and fishing industry vessels. Additionally, the 
Secretary of Transportation was authorized to approve any other 
person to be a mortgagee for vessels with coastwise and 
registry endorsements.
      Section 1113(a) of the Conference substitute amends 
section 31322 of title 46, United States Code, to eliminate all 
restrictions on persons that may be a mortgagee for a U.S.-flag 
vessel. This amendment is intended to promote vessel financing. 
U.S. vessel owners should be able to obtain the cheapest 
financing available anywhere in the world in the same manner as 
their foreign competition without having to get approval from 
the Secretary. In the past, U.S. operators could obtain this 
financing by setting up a trust in a U.S. bank. These trusts, 
called ``Westhampton Trusts,'' resulted in additional costs to 
the U.S. vessel owners without giving any real protection to 
the Government to control the vessel.
      Section 1113(b) repeals section 31328 of title 46, United 
States Code, which provided for the establishment of 
Westhampton Trusts. This section is no longer needed since all 
restrictions on mortgagees have been eliminated.
      Section 1113(c) makes conforming changes to section 9(c) 
of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 808) to eliminate the 
need to obtain permission from the Secretary before using a 
foreign mortgagee.
      Section 1113(d) of the Conference substitute amends 
section 12106 of title 46, United States Code, to promote lease 
financing for vessels engaged in the coastwise trade by 
eliminating citizenship requirements for leasing companies. 
Lease financing has become a very common way to finance capital 
assets in many industries, including the maritime industry. 
Many vessel operators choose to acquire or build vessels 
through lease financing instead of traditional mortgage 
financing. Currently, there are no citizenship requirements on 
leasing companies that finance vessels that have registry 
endorsements. Section 1113(d) will also allow these companies 
to finance vessels that have coastwise endorsements.
      The overall purpose of section 1113(d) of the Conference 
substitute is to eliminate technical impediments to using 
various techniques for financing vessels operating in the 
domestic trades. At the same time, the Conferees do not intend 
to undermine a basic principle of U.S. maritime law that 
vessels operated in domestic trades must be built in a shipyard 
in the United States and be operated and controlled by American 
citizens, which is vital to United States military and economic 
security.
      Ownership of vessels endorsed with a coastwise 
endorsement must reside either with a person who qualifies as 
an American citizen under section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 
(46 App. U.S.C. section 802), or with a person otherwise 
qualified under 46 U.S.C. Sec. 12106. Current law permits oil 
spill response vessels to be owned by non-profit entities which 
may not meet the technical requirements for U.S. citizenship. 
46 U.S.C. Sec. 12106(d).
      Section 1113(d) of the Conference substitute adds a new 
subsection (e) to section 12106 which would permit a coastwise 
endorsement for non-U.S. citizen vessel ownership where (1) 
ownership is primarily a financial investment in the vessel 
without the ability and intent to control the vessel's 
operations by a person not primarily engaged in the direct 
operation or management of vessels and (2) where the owner has 
transferred to a qualified American citizen full possession, 
control and command of the U.S. built vessel in a demise 
charter and the demise charterer is considered the owner pro 
hac vice during the charter term. It is intended that banks, 
leasing companies or other financial institutions qualify as 
owners of U.S.-flag vessels under this section even if they 
have a vessel owning and operating affiliate so long as the 
majority of the aggregate revenues of any such group are not 
derived from the operation or management of vessels by group 
members. Groups primarily engaged in the operation or 
management of commercial foreign-flag vessels used for the 
carriage of cargo for unrelated third parties will not qualify 
under this section.
      Section 1113(d) of the Conference substitute amends 
section 12106 of title 46, United States Code, to authorize the 
Secretary to issue coastwise endorsements for vessels owned by 
any leasing company that is eligible to own a documented 
vessel. However, if the leasing company is not a U.S. citizen 
under section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, the vessel may only 
be operated in the coast trade if the vessel is operated under 
a demise charter to a section 2 citizen for a period of at 
least three years. It is expected that most of the charters 
will be long-term charters until another long-term charter is 
obtained. The lease agreement need not remain in effect for the 
full three years if there is a default by the lessee or a 
casualty or other event where the lease might be terminated by 
the vessel owner or lessee prior to the expiration of that 
period.
      The Secretary may also authorize leases for a period 
shorter than three years under appropriate circumstances such 
as when a vessel's remaining useful life would not support a 
lease of three years or to preserve the use of possession of 
the vessel. The section also provides that on termination of a 
demise charter, the coastwise endorsement may be continued for 
a period not to exceed six months on any terms and conditions 
that the Secretary may prescribe. This will allow the leasing 
company to move the vessel, maintain it, have it repaired, or 
layed-up, but does not allow the vessel to be used in the 
coastwise trade since it is not under a charter to a section 2 
citizen.
      The Secretary shall establish as part of the vessel 
documentation procedures administered by the Coast Guard, or 
its successor, the necessary regulations to administer new 
subsection (e) and the filing of demise charter, and any 
amendments thereto, for vessels issued a coastwise endorsement 
under this provision. Provision shall also be made so that 
proprietary information contained in a demise charter shall not 
be disclosed to the public under this new subsection (e). The 
Coast Guard is directed to develop regulations governing the 
filing of false certifications under (e)(12)(C) with an 
application for documentation for a coastwise endorsement of a 
U.S. built vessel. The Coast Guard is also directed to conduct 
a study regarding reciprocity of foreign leasing laws.

 section 1114. manning and watch requirements on towing vessels on the 
                              great lakes

      Section 1114 of the Senate bill amends section 8104 of 
title 46, United States Code, to conform the manning 
requirements for Great Lakes towing vessels to the requirements 
for towing vessels operating in other parts of the country. 
Section 1114(a) of this section amends section 8104(c) of title 
46 to permit licensed individuals and seamen aboard Great Lakes 
towing vessels to work no more than 15 hours in any 24-hour 
period, or more than 36 hours in any 72-hour period. Section 
1114 also amends section 8104(e) of title 46 to allow crewmen 
to work in both the deck and engine departments of a towing 
vessel operating on the Great Lakes. Finally, the section 
amends section 8104(g) of title 46, United States Code, to 
allow the licensed individuals and crewmembers aboard Great 
Lakes towing vessels to be divided in two watches, rather than 
the current three watch requirement.
      Section 419 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

            section 1115. Repeal of great lakes endorsements

      Section 1115 of the Senate bill corrects an error in the 
Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-225) 
which made technical changes to the Coast Guard vessel 
documentation scheme. These changes reflect the conversion from 
a system of separate and distinct types of documents based on 
the use of the vessel to a system of multiple endorsements for 
a particular trade or use. These changes unintentionally added 
all of the requirements of the U.S. coastwise trade (Jones Act) 
to all vessels operating on the Great Lakes, even those only 
trading between the United States and Canada. This section 
permits U.S.-flag vessels to trade between the United States 
and Canada with a certificate of documentation with a registry 
endorsement. However, a vessel engaged in the coastwise trade 
or fisheries on the Great Lakes must meet all the requirements 
necessary to obtain coastwise or fisheries endorsements.
      Section 746 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision 
with an amendment.

   section 1116. relief from united states documentation requirements

      Section 1116 of the Senate bill would authorize nine 
specific vessels to be sold to a person that is not a citizen 
of the United States and to be transferred or placed under 
foreign registry, notwithstanding the Construction-Differential 
Subsidy requirements. Currently, U.S.-flag vessels built with 
the assistance of a Construction-Differential Subsidy are 
required to be owned by United States citizens and documented 
under the laws of the United States for a period of 25 years.
      Section 609 of the House amendment allows the vessel MV 
Platte to be sold to a non U.S. citizen.
      The Conference substitute amends the Senate provision by 
deleting the vessels Rainbow Hope, Iowa Trader, and Kansas 
Trader, and adding the vessels Bay Ridge and Coastal Golden.

 section 1117. use of foreign registry oil spill response and recovery 
                                vessels

      Section 1117 of the Senate bill allows oil spill response 
and recovery vessels of Canadian registry to operate in waters 
of the United States adjacent to the border between Canada and 
the State of Maine, on an emergency basis, in the event of an 
oil spill. These vessels could only be used if there were not 
enough U.S.-flag recovery vessels available during an oil 
spill.
      The House amendment does not contain a comparable 
provision.
      The Conference substitute expands the Senate provision to 
the use of any foreign registered oil spill response vessel 
throughout the United States.

  section 1118. judicial sale of certain documented vessels to aliens

      Section 1118 of the Senate bill amends section 31329 of 
title 46, United States Code, to allow for the sale, by order 
of a District Court, of recreational vessels to non-U.S. 
citizens. This would conform the conditions for the judicial 
sale of these vessels to the conditions for their private sale 
under section 9(c) of the Shipping Act of 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 
808(c)). In the past, the provisions of section 31329 of title 
46 have unreasonably restricted the foreign sales of 
recreational vessels and the ability of subsequent U.S. owners 
to document the vessels.
      Section 405 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision, but also allows the sale, by an order of a 
court, of documented fishing industry vessels.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House amendment with 
several technical amendments.

      section 1119. improved authority to sell recyclable material

      Section 1119 of the Senate bill amends section 641(c)(2) 
of title 14, United States Code, to exempt sales by the Coast 
Guard of recyclable materials for which the proceeds of sale 
will not exceed $5,000 from current excess property disposal 
requirements for the sale of recyclable materials. This section 
also authorizes the Coast Guard to make these small sales under 
regulations prescribed by the Commandant.
      Section 406 of the House amendment is identical.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

             section 1120. documentation of certain vessels

      Section 1120 of the Senate bill waives certain U.S. 
coastwise trade laws for 65 individually listed vessels.
      Section 601 of the House amendment authorizes the 
Secretary of Transportation to issue a certificate of 
documentation with a coastwise endorsement for a vessel that is 
less than 200 gross tons, is eligible for documentation, was 
built in the United States, and was sold foreign or placed in a 
foreign registry. Section 602 of the amendment provides a 
limited U.S. coastwise trade waiver for the Gallant Lady. 
Section 603 extends the deadline under section 601(d) of the 
Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1993 for the major conversion 
of the vessel M/V Twin Drill from June 30, 1995, to June 30, 
1996. Section 604 grants a U.S. coastwise trade waiver to the 
vessel Rainbow's End. Section 605 of the House amendment grants 
a U.S. coastwise trade waiver to the vessel Gleam. Section 606 
of the House amendment grants a U.S. coastwise trade waiver to 
25 individually listed vessels. Section 607 grants a U.S. 
coastwise trade waiver to four barges owned by McLean 
Contracting Company.
      The Conference substitute adopts all the House and Senate 
provisions. The substitute also allows an additional number of 
individually listed vessels to engage in the U.S. coastwise 
trade. Subsection (f) entitles any vessel that either is 
foreign built prior to the date of enactment of this Act and 
documented under the U.S. registry or is documented under the 
U.S.-flag before the date of enactment, placed under foreign 
registry and subsequently redocumented under U.S. registry, to 
transport liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas to 
Puerto Rico. Subsection (g) deems the coastwise qualified 
vessels Coastal Sea and Coastal Merchant to have been 
constructed in the United States.
      Section 608 grants a U.S. coastwise trade waiver for the 
Enchanted Isle and the Enchanted Seas. The Conferees applaud 
the efforts to reinvigorate the U.S. coastwise cruise vessel 
market with the re-entry of these U.S.-built vessels. The 
Conferees are hopeful that these vessels will prove the 
economic viability of U.S.-built, U.S.-documented vessels in 
the U.S. coastwise trade and will serve as the foundation for 
the re-emergence of a U.S.-built, U.S.-flag cruise vessel 
industry.
      The Conferees believe strongly, however, that the re-
entry into the U.S. coastwise trade of older vessels, albeit 
vessels originally constructed in the United States, is merely 
an interim step in the promotion of a U.S.-flag cruise vessel 
industry. Further vessels obtaining eligibility to operate in 
the U.S. coastwise trade should not only be U.S.-built vessels, 
but also vessels new built in the United States.
      The United States is strongly encouraging construction of 
commercial vessels in U.S. shipyards. U.S. Navy shipbuilding 
orders over the next few years are not projected to be 
sufficient to sustain the U.S. shipyard defense mobilization 
base this country needs in the event of a national emergency. 
Other means of maintaining that mobilization base must also be 
employed.
      Fortunately, U.S. shipyards are showing renewed vigor 
with regard to their international commercial competitiveness. 
U.S. shipyards are winning orders for the export of a number of 
commercial vessels. And the conferees understand that U.S. 
shipyards are developing designs for highly marketable cruise 
vessels that can be constructed by such yards and offered at 
prices competitive with European shipyards, the leaders in 
cruise vessel construction. U.S. government programs, including 
the National Defense Features Program, Maritech, and MARAD 
Title XI should be helpful in assisting U.S. shipyards in 
offering competitive prices for cruise vessels.
      The Conferees, therefore, intend the coastwise re-
flagging permissions contained in this provision to be strictly 
limited. Moreover, the Conferees strongly encourage persons 
affected by this section to replace their vessels as soon as 
practicable with newly constructed U.S.-built cruise vessels 
and to take advantage of U.S. Navy and other government 
incentives in such new construction.
      Section 1120(g) of the Conference substitute simply deems 
three forfeiture vessels to be considered to be ``constructed 
in the United States'' for the limited purpose of the Merchant 
Marine Act of 1936, as amended.
      Section 1120(h) of the Conference substitute inserts a 
new section in the Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1996 which authorizes the repayment to the Secretary of 
Transportation of the remaining unamortized construction-
differential subsidy on the tug M/V Janis Guzzle. The repayment 
of the unamortized portion of the construction-differential 
subsidy for the vessel will permanently release it from the 
domestic trading restrictions.

        section 1121. vessel deemed to be a recreational vessel

      Section 1121 of the Senate bill deems an approximately 96 
meter twin screw motor yacht, to be named the Limitless, to be 
a recreational vessel under chapter 43 of title 46, United 
States Code, as along as the vessel does not carry passengers 
for hire or engage in commercial fishing.
      Section 428 of the House amendment is similar to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

section 1122. small passenger vessel pilot inspection program with the 
                           state of minnesota

      Section 1122 of the Senate bill allows the Secretary of 
Transportation to enter into an agreement with the State of 
Minnesota under which the state may inspect small passenger 
vessels operating in the waters of Minnesota under certain 
conditions.
      The House amendment has no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision. As 
a matter of Constitutional law, the Federal Government has 
responsibility for requirements pertaining to vessel structure, 
design, equipment, and operation. (See Ray v. Atlantic 
Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151 (1978) and Kelly v. Washington, 302 
U.S. 1 (1937)). Authority to make such regulations are vested 
in the Secretary of Transportation under sections 3306 and 3307 
of title 46, United States Code. Federal uniformity in these 
matters is critical to maintain interstate and international 
commerce, and because the absence of uniformity hinders the 
United States' ability to seek increased international vessel 
standards to better protect the environment.
      However, the Coast Guard is allowed to delegate its' 
authority to non-Federal entities and has delegated its' 
authority to inspect vessels to private classification 
societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping. This section 
establishes a new type of delegation--to a State. However, the 
State must enter into an agreement that will ensure that the 
State will apply the Federal standards to the inspection of 
these vessels. This will guarantee that there will continue to 
be uniformity in the application of the law to all vessels 
subject to Federal jurisdiction in Minnesota.

   section 1123. commonwealth of the northern mariana islands fishing

      Section 1123 of the Senate bill allows an alien employed 
under the immigration laws of the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Mariana Islands (CNMI) to be employed on a fishing vessel in 
the CNMI if the vessel is permanently stationed at a port 
within the Commonwealth.
      The House amendment has no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

 section 1124. availability of extrajudicial remedies upon default of 
                  preferred mortgage liens on vessels

      Section 1124 of the Senate bill establishes a nonjudicial 
alternative for lenders to take possession of a vessel after a 
default.
      Under current law, marine lenders seeking to foreclose 
loans secured by mortgaged vessels must pursue their rights in 
the courts to clearly preserve their right to recover a 
deficiency after the sale of the vessel.
      Section 31325 of title 46, United States Code, provides 
for the foreclosure of a preferred mortgage on a documented 
vessel by an in rem arrest action against the vessel within the 
district court's admiralty jurisdiction. This remedy 
establishes the priority for the mortgage lien as against any 
maritime lien or land-based lien on the vessel and permits the 
vessel to be sold free and clear of liens.
      Under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in almost 
every state, a secured creditor may take possession of the 
collateral security for the loan upon a default and sell it in 
foreclosure of the creditor's lien. For many years, lender's 
holding preferred mortgages on documented vessels regularly 
exercised this type of ``self-help'' remedy to sell mortgaged 
vessels upon a loan default. Particularly for smaller loans 
secured by recreational vessels, when the debtor raised no 
opposition to repossession and there was little likelihood of 
an adverse maritime lien claim against the vessel, there was no 
reason to go through the time-consuming, expensive procedures 
of an action in court.
      In 1985, the decision in Bank of America National Trust 
and Savings Association v. Fogle, 637 F. Supp. 305, 1986 AMC 
205 (N.D. Cal. 1985) was rendered. In Fogle, the court held 
that in providing for an in rem admiralty remedy in law, 
Congress must have intended to preclude a ``self-help'' remedy 
under state law. The Fogle decision has forced lenders seeking 
to foreclose defaulted loans secured by documented vessels to 
use a court action, even when no controversy requiring judicial 
action is necessary.
      Section 1124(a) of the Senate bill adds a new paragraph 
(3) to section 31325(b) of title 46, United States Code, to 
clarify that the remedies currently available under section 
31325(b) do not preclude the exercise of other lawful rights 
and remedies available to mortgagees, including extrajudicial, 
``self-help'' remedies. New paragraph 31325(b)(3) also supports 
the international recognition of vessel mortgage foreclosures 
under principles of comity and permits a preferred mortgage on 
a U.S.-flag vessel to be foreclosed in a foreign court having 
jurisdiction over the vessel.
      Consistent with existing law, the rights of any maritime 
lien claimant or holder of a preferred mortgage are expressly 
preserved under the amendments made by this section, 
notwithstanding the use of a self-help remedy under state law.
      The amendment will also not affect the remedies available 
under state law to the holder of a security interest which is 
deemed to be a preferred mortgage pursuant to section 31322(d) 
of title 46, United States Code, when the Vessel Identification 
System established under chapter 125 of title 46 is effective.
      Section 1124(b) of this bill requires the person 
exercising the extrajudicial remedy to give notice of the 
remedy to the Coast Guard, to any other mortgage whose mortgage 
is recorded, and to any maritime claimant who has recorded a 
notice of a claim of a lien with the Coast Guard.
      Section 412 of the House amendment is identical to the 
Senate provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

 section 1125. offshore facility financial responsibility requirements

      The Senate bill contains a provision regarding offshore 
oil spill evidence of financial responsibility.
      The House amendment also contains a provision.
      The Conference substitute contains a compromise 
amendment.

 section 1126. deauthorization of navigation project, cohasset harbor, 
                             massachusetts

      Section 1126 of the Senate bill deauthorizes a portion of 
the navigation project in Cohasset Harbor, Massachusetts.
      The House amendment has no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute adopts the Senate provision.

     section 1127. sense of congress; requirement regarding notice

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      Section 410 of the House amendment expresses the sense of 
the Congress that, to the greatest extent practicable, all 
equipment and products purchased by the Coast Guard should be 
American-made.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision.

        section 1128. requirement for procurement of buoy chain

      The Senate bill does not contain a comparable provision.
      Section 429 of the House amendment requires that the 
Coast Guard purchase buoy chain manufactured in the United 
States.
      The Conference substitute adopts the House provision with 
an amendment.

                  section 1129. cruise ship liability

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      Section 430 of the House amendment makes three changes in 
current maritime law: The first allows foreign ship owners to 
provide that foreign crew members must bring lawsuits for 
damages involving injury or death in appropriate foreign 
courts. The second provision allows a shipowner to invoke a 
state's cap on medical malpractice damages when the shipowner 
is held vicariously liable for a doctor's medical malpractice. 
The third provision prohibits cruise vessel passengers from 
recovering damages for psychological injuries that are not 
accompanied by physical injury or actual risk of physical 
injury.
      The Conference substitute adopts two subsections of the 
House amendment, with amendments. Section 1129(a) of the 
conference substitute provides that in a civil action by any 
person in which the operator or owner of a vessel is claimed to 
have vicarious liability for medical malpractice involving a 
crewmember that occurs to a shoreside facility, to the extent 
the damages resulted from the conduct of any shoreside doctor, 
hospital, medical facility, or other health care provider, the 
owner or operator of the vessel is entitled to rely upon 
statutory limitations applicable to the doctor or other health 
care provider in the state in which the shoreside medical care 
was provided. Section 1129(b) allows an owner or operator of a 
vessel to be relieved from liability for infliction of 
emotional distress under certain conditions. This relief does 
not apply if the emotional distress was the result of physical 
injury to the claimant caused by negligence of the owner, the 
result of the claimant having been at actual risk of physical 
injury, or intentionally inflicted by a crewmember or the owner 
or operator of the vessel (or his manager, agent, or master). 
Nothing in the Conference substitute limits the liability of a 
crewmember or the manager, agent, master, owner or operator of 
a vessel in a case involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, 
or rape.

 section 1130. sense of congress on the implementation of regulations 
                regarding animal fats and vegetable oils

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      In enacting the Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act, Public 
Law 104-55, the Congress intended that the agencies recognize 
the differences between animal fats and vegetable oils from 
other oils and provide regulatory relief from the burdens of 
various environmental statutes, such as the Oil Pollution Act 
of 1990 and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Those 
statutes were enacted to regulate petroleum oil and other toxic 
oils and hazardous substances. Because of the over broad 
definition of oil, those statutes applied to animal fats and 
vegetable oils as well. This provision expresses the sense of 
Congress that agencies responsible for the regulation of animal 
fats and vegetable oils under those laws should consider and 
recognize the differences in these oils and structure different 
regulatory requirements based on those differences. This 
provision also requires the submission of an annual report to 
Congress on the implementation of this policy.
      The Conference substitute expresses the sense of Congress 
that agencies responsible for the regulation of animal fats and 
vegetable oils should consider and recognize the differences 
between these oils and petroleum-based oils and implement 
regulatory requirements reflective of those differences. This 
provision also requires the submission of an annual report to 
Congress on the implementation of this policy.

    section 1131. term of director of the bureau of transportation 
                               statistics

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute provides that when the term of 
the Director of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) 
expires, the Director may continue to serve until his or her 
successor is appointed and confirmed. It is important to 
provide for continuity in the leadership of BTS, due to the 
important work that BTS performs.

   section 1132. waiver of certain requirements for historic former 
                       presidential yacht sequoia

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The SEQUOIA was originally constructed in 1925 and served 
as a presidential yacht for over half a century. It is a 
national treasure listed on the Register of the National Trust 
for Historic Preservation. The vessel has been completely 
refurbished and restored in a manner in which its historic 
value has been preserved and the vessel has recently been 
brought up to date. The Conferees intend for the Coast Guard to 
work with the vessel's owners to allow the SEQUOIA to carry 
passengers for hire without imposing requirements that 
compromise the historic integrity of the restoration of the 
vessel or the safety of its passengers.

                   section 1133. vessel requirements

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute (1) extends the original 
expiration date by ten years from 1998 to 2008; (2) expands the 
term ``a vessel''; and (3) modestly expands the permissible 
area of operation beyond inland rivers to include that narrow 
band shoreward of the boundary Line.
      The Conferees urge the Coast Guard to work with the 
owners of the Delta King to assist them in meeting the 
inspection standards in the most cost effective manner 
possible.

              section 1134. existing tank vessel research

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute requires the Secretary of 
Transportation to fully fund certain research projects intended 
to evaluate double-hull alternatives by the end of Fiscal Year 
1997. The substitute also permits the Secretary to use public 
vessels for research in oil pollution technologies which 
prevent or mitigate oil discharges and protect the environment. 
This public vessel use is restricted to projects sponsored by 
the U.S. government so that the status of the vessel as a 
public vessel will not be lost, and so that no additional cost 
will be added to the project.

section 1135. plan for the engineering, design, and retrofitting of the 
                          icebreaker mackinaw

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute requires the Coast Guard to 
submit by May 1, 1997, a plan and cost estimate for the 
engineering, design, and retrofitting of the icebreaker 
Mackinaw.

                  section 1136. cross border financing

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      Currently U.S. companies wanting to purchase vessels and 
then place those vessels under United States registry cannot 
take full advantage of modern financing methods available to 
their foreign competition and other domestic transportation 
sectors. For example, the U.S. airline industry frequently 
acquires aircraft by chartering them from ownership trusts that 
have non-citizen beneficiaries. Many investors view ownership 
trusts as more secure than debt instruments (such as mortgages) 
and trusts sometimes receive favorable treatment under foreign 
tax codes. Furthermore, there is no reason why these trusts 
cannot be structured in a way that preserves U.S. citizen 
control of vessels.
      Under current U.S. law, a vessel owned by a trust is 
eligible for documentation only if all its ``members'' are U.S. 
citizens and it is capable of holding title to a vessel under 
the Laws of the United States or a State. The U.S. Coast Guard 
has interpreted this requirement to mean that a trust 
arrangement is a citizen if each of its trustees and each 
beneficiary with an enforceable interest in the trust is a 
citizen. In contrast, a corporation is a documentation citizen 
if it was established under U.S. law and the CEO, Chairman of 
its board and a sufficient number of board members sufficient 
to establish a quorum are all U.S. citizens. There is no 
requirement that the stock of the corporation be owned by 
citizens, because the purpose of the law is satisfied so long 
as the vessel is controlled by U.S. citizens. Unfortunately, 
the ambiguity of the law with respect to passive beneficiaries 
of trusts is impeding the revitalization of our fleet.
      Under present law, the Secretary of Transportation may 
grant the right to sell or transfer a vessel foreign generally 
only after it is documented under the U.S. flag. Investors will 
not participate in financing vessels using these trusts unless 
they can first be assured that a particular trust instrument 
will meet the documentation test and they have the option to 
sell or transfer the vessel world-wide if the vessel charterer 
subsequently defaults or the charter terminates. It is not 
realistic to expect much enthusiasm from investors unless they 
have reasonable option to protect their assets.
      Section 1136(a) of the Conference substitute amends 
section 12102 of Title 46 to permit documentation of vessels 
subject to ownership trusts under which not all of the 
beneficiaries are U.S. citizens, provided that the trust 
document permits not more than 25% of the authority to direct 
or remove a trustee is held by non-citizens, and the trustee(s) 
gives certain assurances. The conferees intend this section to 
be implemented in the same manner as similar cross border 
leasing transactions as for aircraft administered by the FAA. 
New section 12102(d)(4) provides that a vessel chartered by the 
trust to a citizen of the United States under section 2 of the 
Shipping Act, 1916 is deemed to be a citizen of the United 
States for purposes of that section and related laws such as 
the Capital Construction Fund Program. However, the charterer 
is not considered a section 2 citizen for purposes of new 
subtitle B of title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 which 
is dealt with separately in this section. The purpose of this 
section is to allow greater flexibility for section 2 citizens 
to use widely used international financing practices to 
decrease the acquisition cost of new vessels.
      Section 1136(b) amends Section 9 of the Shipping Act, 
1916 to permit the Secretary of Transportation to grant, prior 
to the documentation of a vessel, approval for prospective sale 
or transfer foreign of a vessel owned by these trusts. This 
amendment codifies current practices of the Secretary.
      Section 1136(c) provides that for purposes of determining 
whether a vessel is owned and operated by a citizen of the 
United States for participation in the program established 
under subtitle B of title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, 
a vessel chartered by a trust under section 12102(d)(2) of 
title 46, United States Code (as enacted by subsection (a) of 
this section) is a citizen of the United States under section 2 
of the Shipping Act, 1916 if: (1) the vessel is delivered by a 
shipbuilder on or after May 1, 1995 and before January 31, 
1996; (2) the vessel is owned by a section 2 citizen on 
September 1, 1996 or is a replacement for such a vessel; or (3) 
payments have been made with respect to the vessel under 
subtitle B of title VI of that Act for at least one year.
      Section 1136(d) provides that, for purposes of 
determining whether a vessel is owned and operated by a citizen 
of the United States for participation in the program 
established under subtitle B of title VI of the Merchant Marine 
Act, 1936, a vessel is deemed to be owned and operated by a 
section 2 citizen if the vessel is owned ``directly or 
indirectly'' by a section 2 citizen and the vessel was: (1) 
built under a shipbuilding contract signed on December 21, 1995 
and having hull number 3077, 3078, 3079, or 3080; (2) delivered 
by a shipbuilder on or after May 1, 1995 and before January 31, 
1996; owned by a section 2 citizen on September 1, 1996 or is a 
replacement for such a vessel; or (4) the beneficiary of under 
subtitle B of title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 for at 
least 1 year.
      Nothing in the amendments made by this section diminishes 
the authority of the Secretary to impose reasonable conditions, 
such as requisition of the vessel in time of emergency under 
Section 902 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, on the foreign 
transfer of a vessel.

                     SECTION 1137. VESSEL STANDARDS

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute provides for Certification of 
Inspection provisions, and for reliance on non-governmental 
classification societies. Subsection (b) applies only for the 
period of time that the vessel fails to comply with the 
applicable standards.

 SECTION 1138. VESSELS SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES

      The Senate bill contains a provision enhancing law 
enforcement authorities related to vessels and aircraft.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute establishes new law enforcement 
provisions which expand the Government's prosecutorial 
effectiveness in drug smuggling cases. Claims of foreign 
registry must be ``affirmatively and unequivocally'' verified 
by the nation of registry to be valid. People arrested in these 
international situations would not be able to use as a defense 
that the U.S. was acting in violation of international law 
regarding recognition of registry at the time of the arrest. 
The Secretary of State's certification as to the content of 
discussions with foreign nations about matters of registry 
would be considered ``fact'', irrespective of the statements or 
certifications of the foreign nation at a later time. 
Jurisdictional issues would always be issues of law to be 
decided by the trial judge, not issues of fact to be decided by 
the jury.

             SECTION 1139. REACTIVATION OF CLOSED SHIPYARDS

      The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.
      The House amendment contains no comparable provision.
      The Conference substitute establishes the basis for the 
Secretary of Transportation to assist certain closed shipyards 
by supporting projects for the reactivation and modernization 
of those yards and the construction of ships at those yards. 
Subsection (a) authorizes the Secretary to provide loan 
guarantees under the shipping laws to assist in the 
reactivation and modernization of a currently closed shipyard 
that (1) historically built vessels and intends to compete in 
international commercial shipbuilding; (2) is either a 
designated public-private partnership project or has an 
approved reuse plan and revolving economic conversion fund; and 
(3) involves a State or State-chartered agency that makes a 
significant investment in the project.
      Subsection (b) waives the application of certain factors 
designed to apply to existing yards but subsection (c) directs 
the Secretary to impose appropriate standards for a 
reactivation and modernization project to protect the United 
States from the risk of default. Included in subsection (c) is 
a provision regarding shipyard and shipbuilding project 
interdependency. This provision was added to give the Maritime 
Administration guidance when considering whether to issue a 
guarantee or a commitment to guarantee obligations for the 
construction of vessels in connection with and as an integral 
part of the reactivation or modernization of closed shipyards. 
It recognizes that vessels integral to the reactivation of a 
closed shipyard may request approval of a loan guarantee at the 
same time the closed shipyard is requesting approval of a loan 
guarantee and that due consideration and weight should be 
afforded the vessel's application. This interdependency 
language is intended to facilitate the Maritime 
Administration's review and approval of closed shipyard and 
vessel loan guarantee applications simultaneously as part of 
the total shipyard reactivation and modernization project. This 
is not intended, however, to be a limiting provision allowing 
the Maritime Administration to precondition the issuance of a 
guarantee or commitment to guarantee for a closed shipyard on 
the approval of related vessel loan guarantees.
      Subsection (d) limits the aggregate guarantees for 
shipyards only under this section to $100 million, requires a 
State or State-agency to provide to the Secretary the amount of 
funds needed to cover the risk factor cost under the Federal 
Credit Reform Act for the Secretary to deposit into a financing 
account in the Treasury, and provides for the reversion of the 
deposited amount to the State or State-agency if, on the 
expiration of the guarantee, no obligation is to be paid from 
the deposited funds under the terms of the guarantee. Other 
factors related to the cost of a guarantee are established in
