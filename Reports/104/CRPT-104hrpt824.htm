      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

    The Committee on Resources, to whom was referred the bill 
(H.R. 3155) to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act by 
designating the Wekiva River, Seminole Creek, and Rock Springs 
Run in the State of Florida for study and potential addition to 
the national wild and scenic rivers system, having considered 
the same, report favorably thereon with an amendment and 
recommend that the bill as amended do pass.
    The amendment is as follows:
    The amendment (stated in terms of the page and line number 
of the introduced bill) is as follows:
    Page 2, line 9, strike ``one year'' and insert ``two 
years''.

                          Purpose of the Bill

    The purpose of H.R. 3155 is to amend the Wild and Scenic 
Rivers Act by designating the Wekiva River, Seminole Creek and 
Rock Springs Run in the State of Florida for study and 
potential addition to the national wild and scenic rivers 
system.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

    H.R. 3155 provides for a study under the Wild and Scenic 
Rivers Act of the 27-mile long Wekiva River and several of its 
tributaries located in Central Florida.
    The Wekiva River is a largely undeveloped stream which 
possesses good water quality, a rich diversity of biological 
resources and important geological features. It is already 
protected under State law as a Wild and Scenic River because of 
its resource values. In fact, the State of Florida has already 
acquired over 20,000 acres along its banks for preservation 
purposes. In addition, the federal government has already 
recognized the river as having a number of important features 
and has recommended it for study by placing it on the federal 
nationwide river inventory.

                            Committee Action

    H.R. 3155 was introduced on March 22, 1996, by Congressman 
Bill McCollum (R-FL). The bill was referred to the Committee on 
Resources and within the Committee to the Subcommittee on 
National Parks, Forests and Lands. On July 9, 1996, the 
Subcommittee held a hearing on the bill where the 
Administration testified in support of the measure. On 
September 18, 1996, after discharging the Subcommittee from 
further consideration of the bill, the Full Committee met to 
consider H.R. 3155. Congressman Joel Hefley (R-CO) offered an 
amendment to extend the due date of the study from one to two 
years; it was adopted by unanimous consent. The bill, as 
amended, was then ordered favorably reported to the House of 
Representatives by voice vote.

                      Section-by-Section Analysis

                   Section 1. Additional Designation

    This section amends section 5 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers 
Act (16 U.S.C. 1276) to authorize a study of the Wekiva River, 
the Seminole Creek tributary and the Rock Springs Creek 
tributary for possible future designation under the Act.

                      Section 2. Study and Report

    Section 2 also amends section 5 of the Wild and Scenic 
River Act to require the study authorized under section 1 of 
the bill to be transmitted to Congress within two years after 
the date of enactment of H.R. 3155.

            Committee Oversight Findings and Recommendations

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and clause 
2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
the Committee on Resources' oversight findings and 
recommendations are reflected in the body of this report.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that the 
enactment of H.R. 3155 will have no significant inflationary 
impact on prices and costs in the operation of the national 
economy.

                        Cost of the Legislation

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires an estimate and a comparison by the 
Committee of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out 
H.R. 3155. However, clause 7(d) of that Rule provides that this 
requirement does not apply when the Committee has included in 
its report a timely submitted cost estimate of the bill 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                     Compliance With House Rule XI

    1. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(B) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, H.R. 
3155 does not contain any new budget authority, spending 
authority, credit authority, or an increase or decrease in 
revenues or tax expenditures.
    2. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(D) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee has received no report of oversight findings and 
recommendations from the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight on the subject of H.R. 3155.
    3. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(C) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the 
Committee has received the following cost estimate for H.R. 
3155 from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 20, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 3155, a bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers 
Act by designating the Wekiva River, Seminole Creek, and Rock 
Springs Run in the state of Florida for study and potential 
addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system. H.R. 
3155 was ordered reported by the House Committee on Resources 
on September 18, 1996.
    Based on information from the National Park Service (NPS), 
we estimate that carrying out the study specified in the bill 
would cost about $200,000 over the 1997-1998 period, assuming 
appropriation of the estimated amount. The bill would direct 
the NPS to complete the study within two years. Enacting H.R. 
3155 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, 
pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply to the bill.
    H.R. 3155 contains no private-sector or intergovernmental 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local, 
or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Victoria V. 
Heid and Rachel Forward.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).

                    Compliance With Public Law 104-4

    H.R. 3155 contains no unfunded mandates.
