                involuntary servitude, and slave trade offenses

        alien who is brought to the United States after having

                        having committed any offense covered in 
                        section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii), (A)(iii), 
                        (B), (C), or (D) of such Act (before 
                        redesignation under this subtitle), or

                        212(a)(3)(B) of such Act or deportable

                        (before redesignation under this 
                        subtitle),
                when the alien is released, without regard to 
                whether the alien is released on parole, 
                supervised release, or probation, and without 
                regard to whether the alien may be arrested or 
                imprisoned again for the same offense.
                    (B) Release.--The Attorney General may 
                release the alien only if the alien is an alien 
                described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (A)(iii)

                            (i) the alien was lawfully admitted 
                        to the United States and satisfies the 
                        Attorney General that the alien will 
                        not pose a danger to the safety of 
                        other persons or of property and is 
                        likely to appear for any scheduled 
                        proceeding, or
                            (ii) the alien was not lawfully 
                        admitted to the United States, cannot 
                        be removed because the designated 
                        country of removal will not accept the 
                        alien, and satisfies the Attorney 
                        General that the alien will not pose a 
                        danger to the safety of other persons 
                        or of property and is likely to appear 
                        for any scheduled proceeding.

        deportability of an alien.

        under this section may be charged with any applicable

        the alien and any witnesses. The immigration judge may 
        issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and 
        presentation of evidence. The immigration judge shall 
        have authority (under regulations prescribed by the 
        Attorney General) to sanction by civil money penalty 
        any action (or inaction) in contempt of the judge's

                proceed in person or through video conference.

                fiscal year 1995 for the State Criminal Alien 
                Assistance Program, the Department of Justice 
                disbursed the first $43,000,000 to States on 
                October 6, 1994, 32 days before the 1994 
                general election, and then failed to disburse

                1996, 123 days after the end of fiscal year 
                1995.

                appropriation measure funding certain 
                operations of the Federal Government from 
                January 26, 1996 to March 15, 1996, included

                incarcerating documented illegal immigrant 
                felons, the Department of Justice failed to 
                disburse any of the funds to the States during 
                the period of the continuing appropriation.
            (2) Sense of the congress.--It is the sense of the 
        Congress that--
                    (A) the Department of Justice was

                1995 funds under the State Criminal Alien 
                Assistance Program to States after the initial 
                grants were released just prior to the 1994 
                election; and
                    (B) the Attorney General should make it a 
                high priority to expedite the disbursement of 
                Federal funds intended to reimburse States for 
                the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants, 
                aiming for all State Criminal Alien Assistance

        and Naturalization Service who has expertise in the

SEC. 330. PRISONER TRANSFER TREATIES.

    (a) Negotiations With Other Countries.--(1) Congress 
advises the President to begin to negotiate and renegotiate, 
not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
bilateral prisoner transfer treaties, providing for the 
incarceration, in the country of the alien's nationality, of 
any alien who--
            (A) is a national of a country that is party to 
        such a treaty; and
            (B) has been convicted of a criminal offense under 
        Federal or State law and who--
                    (i) is not in lawful immigration status in 
                the United States, or
                    (ii) on the basis of conviction for a 
                criminal offense under Federal or State law, or 
                on any other basis, is subject to deportation 
                or removal under the Immigration and 
                Nationality Act,

for the duration of the prison term to which the alien was 
sentenced for the offense referred to in subparagraph (B). Any 
such agreement may provide for the release of such alien 
pursuant to parole procedures of that country.
    (2) In entering into negotiations under paragraph (1), the 
President may consider providing for appropriate compensation, 
subject to the availability of appropriations, in cases where 
the United States is able to independently verify the adequacy 
of the sites where aliens will be imprisoned and the length of 
time the alien is actually incarcerated in the foreign country 
under such a treaty.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress 
that--
            (1) the focus of negotiations for such agreements 
        should be--
                    (A) to expedite the transfer of aliens 
                unlawfully in the United States who are (or are 
                about to be) incarcerated in United States 
                prisons,
                    (B) to ensure that a transferred prisoner 
                serves the balance of the sentence imposed by 
                the United States courts,
                    (C) to eliminate any requirement of 
                prisoner consent to such a transfer, and
                    (D) to allow the Federal Government or the 
                States to keep their original prison sentences 
                in force so that transferred prisoners who 
                return to the United States prior to the 
                completion of their original United States 
                sentences can be returned to custody for the 
                balance of their prisons sentences;
            (2) the Secretary of State should give priority to 
        concluding an agreement with any country for which the 
        President determines that the number of aliens 
        described in subsection (a) who are nationals of that 
        country in the United States represents a significant 
        percentage of all such aliens in the United States; and
            (3) no new treaty providing for the transfer of 
        aliens from Federal, State, or local incarceration 
        facilities to a foreign incarceration facility should 
        permit the alien to refuse the transfer.
    (c) Prisoner Consent.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, except as required by treaty, the transfer of an alien 
from a Federal, State, or local incarceration facility under an 
agreement of the type referred to in subsection (a) shall not 
require consent of the alien.
    (d) Annual Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the 
Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committees on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate 
stating whether each prisoner transfer treaty to which the 
United States is a party has been effective in the preceding 12 
months in bringing about the return of deportable incarcerated 
aliens to the country of which they are nationals and in 
ensuring that they serve the balance of their sentences.
    (e) Training Foreign Law Enforcement Personnel.--(1) 
Subject to paragraph (2), the President shall direct the Border 
Patrol Academy and the Customs Service Academy to enroll for 
training an appropriate number of foreign law enforcement 
personnel, and shall make appointments of foreign law 
enforcement personnel to such academies, as necessary to 
further the following United States law enforcement goals:
            (A) Preventing of drug smuggling and other cross-
        border criminal activity.
            (B) Preventing illegal immigration.
            (C) Preventing the illegal entry of goods into the 
        United States (including goods the sale of which is 
        illegal in the United States, the entry of which would 
        cause a quota to be exceeded, or the appropriate duty 
        or tariff for which has not been paid).
    (2) The appointments described in paragraph (1) shall be 
made only to the extent there is capacity in such academies 
beyond what is required to train United States citizens needed 
in the Border Patrol and Customs Service, and only of personnel 
from a country with which the prisoner transfer treaty has been 
stated to be effective in the most recent report referred to in 
subsection (d).
    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized 
to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out 
this section.

include the recommendations of the Secretary of State and the

Attorney General shall consult with such State and local 
officials in areas disproportionately impacted by aliens 
convicted of criminal offenses as the Secretary and the 
Attorney General consider appropriate. Such recommendations 
shall address--
            (1) changes in Federal laws, regulations, and 
        policies affecting the identification, prosecution, and 
        deportation of aliens who have committed criminal 
        offenses in the United States;
            (2) changes in State and local laws, regulations,

        offenses who may be transferred pursuant to the

            (4) methods for preventing the unlawful reentry 
        into the United States of aliens who have been 
        convicted of criminal offenses in the United States and 
        transferred pursuant to the treaties;
            (5) any recommendations by appropriate officials of 
        the appropriate government agencies of such countries 
        regarding programs to achieve the goals of, and ensure 
        full compliance with, the treaties;
            (6) whether the recommendations under this 
        subsection require the renegotiation of the treaties;

                circumstances that the Attorney General

                would not appear, as agreed, at subsequent 
                exclusion or deportation proceedings).

                is in effect)--
                            (i) to all its hiring (and all 
                        recruitment or referral) in the State

                        hiring (or recruitment or referral) in

                hiring (or recruitment or referral) if the 
                Attorney General has determined that there are 
                insufficient resources to provide appropriate 
                services under a pilot program for the person's 
                or entity's hiring (or recruitment or referral)

            (4) Termination of elections.--The Attorney General 
        may terminate an election by a person or other entity 
        under this section because the person or entity has

                274A(b)(2), such identification or 
                authorization number established by the 
                Immigration and Naturalization Service for the 
                alien as the Attorney General shall specify,
        and shall retain the original form and make it 
        available for inspection for the period and in the 
        manner required of I-9 forms under section 274A(b)(3).
            (2) Presentation of documentation.--
                    (A) In general.--The person or other 
                entity, and the individual whose identity and 
                employment eligibility are being confirmed, 
                shall, subject to subparagraph (B), fulfill the 
                requirements of section 274A(b) with the 
                following modifications:
                            (i) A document referred to in 
                        section 274A(b)(1)(B)(ii) (as 
                        redesignated by section 412(a)) must be 
                        designated by the Attorney General as 
                        suitable for the purpose of 
                        identification in a pilot program.
                            (ii) A document referred to in 
                        section 274A(b)(1)(D) must contain a 
                        photograph of the individual.
                            (iii) The person or other entity 
                        has complied with the requirements of 
                        section 274A(b)(1) with respect to 
                        examination of a document if the 
                        document reasonably appears on its face 
                        to be genuine and it reasonably appears 
                        to pertain to the individual whose 
                        identity and work eligibility is being 
                        confirmed.
                    (B) Limitation of requirement to examine 
                documentation.--If the Attorney General finds 
                that a pilot program would reliably determine 
                with respect to an individual whether--
                            (i) the person with the identity 
                        claimed by the individual is authorized 
                        to work in the United States, and
                            (ii) the individual is claiming the 
                        identity of another person,

                if a person or entity could fulfill the 
                requirement to examine documentation contained 
                in subparagraph (A) of section 274A(b)(1) by 
                examining a document specified in either 
                subparagraph (B) or (D) of such section, the 
                Attorney General may provide that, for purposes 
                of such requirement, only such a document need 
                be examined. In such case, any reference in 
                section 274A(b)(1)(A) to a verification that an 
                individual is not an unauthorized alien shall 
                be deemed to be a verification of the 
                individual's identity.
            (3) Seeking confirmation.--
                    (A) In general.--The person or other entity 
                shall make an inquiry, as provided in section 
                404(a)(1), using the confirmation system to 
                seek confirmation of the identity and 
                employment eligibility of an individual, by not 
                later than the end of 3 working days (as 
                specified by the Attorney General) after the 
                date of the hiring (or recruitment or referral, 
                as the case may be).
                    (B) Extension of time period.--If the 
                person or other entity in good faith attempts 
                to make an inquiry during such 3 working days 
                and the confirmation system has registered that 
                not all inquiries were received during such 
                time, the person or entity can make an inquiry 
                in the first subsequent working day in which 
                the confirmation system registers that it has 
                received all inquiries. If the confirmation 
                system cannot receive inquiries at all times 
                during a day, the person or entity merely has 
                to assert that the entity attempted to make the 
                inquiry on that day for the previous sentence 
                to apply to such an inquiry, and does not have 
                to provide any additional proof concerning such 
                inquiry.
            (4) Confirmation or nonconfirmation.--
                    (A) Confirmation upon initial inquiry.--If 
                the person or other entity receives an 
                appropriate confirmation of an individual's 
                identity and work eligibility under the 
                confirmation system within the time period 
                specified under section 404(b), the person or 
                entity shall record on the I-9 or similar form 
                an appropriate code that is provided under the 
                system and that indicates a final confirmation 
                of such identity and work eligibility of the 
                individual.
                    (B) Nonconfirmation upon initial inquiry 
                and secondary verification.--
                            (i) Nonconfirmation.--If the person 
                        or other entity receives a tentative 
                        nonconfirmation of an individual's 
                        identity or work eligibility under the 
                        confirmation system within the time 
                        period specified under 404(b), the 
                        person or entity shall so inform the 
                        individual for whom the confirmation is 
                        sought.
                            (ii) No contest.--If the individual 
                        does not contest the nonconfirmation 
                        within the time period specified in 
                        section 404(c), the nonconfirmation 
                        shall be considered final. The person 
                        or entity shall then record on the I-9 
                        or similar form an appropriate code 
                        which has been provided under the 
                        system to indicate a tentative 
                        nonconfirmation.
                            (iii) Contest.--If the individual 
                        does contest the nonconfirmation, the 
                        individual shall utilize the process 
                        for secondary verification provided 
                        under section 404(c). The 
                        nonconfirmation will remain tentative 
                        until a final confirmation or 
                        nonconfirmation is provided by the 
                        confirmation system within the time 
                        period specified in such section. In no 
                        case shall an employer terminate 
                        employment of an individual because of 
                        a failure of the individual to have 
                        identity and work eligibility confirmed 
                        under this section until a 
                        nonconfirmation becomes final. Nothing 
                        in this clause shall apply to a 
                        termination of employment for any 
                        reason other than because of such a 
                        failure.
                            (iv) Recording of conclusion on 
                        form.--If a final confirmation or 
                        nonconfirmation is provided by the 
                        confirmation system under section 
                        404(c) regarding an individual, the 
                        person or entity shall record on the I-
                        9 or similar form an appropriate code 
                        that is provided under the system and 
                        that indicates a confirmation or 
                        nonconfirmation of identity and work 
                        eligibility of the individual.
                    (C) Consequences of nonconfirmation.--
                            (i) Termination or notification of 
                        continued employment.--If the person or 
                        other entity has received a final 
                        nonconfirmation regarding an individual 
                        under subparagraph (B), the person or 
                        entity may terminate employment (or 
                        recruitment or referral) of the 
                        individual. If the person or entity 
                        does not terminate employment (or 
                        recruitment or referral) of the 
                        individual, the person or entity shall 
                        notify the Attorney General of such 
                        fact through the confirmation system or 
                        in such other manner as the Attorney 
                        General may specify.
                            (ii) Failure to notify.--If the 
                        person or entity fails to provide 
                        notice with respect to an individual as 
                        required under clause (i), the failure 
                        is deemed to constitute a violation of 
                        section 274A(a)(1)(B) with respect to 
                        that individual and the applicable 
                        civil monetary penalty under section 
                        274A(e)(5) shall be (notwithstanding 
                        the amounts specified in such section) 
                        no less than $500 and no more than 
                        $1,000 for each individual with respect 
                        to whom such violation occurred.
                            (iii) Continued employment after 
                        final nonconfirmation.--If the person 
                        or other entity continues to employ (or 
                        to recruit or refer) an individual 
                        after receiving final nonconfirmation, 
                        a rebuttable presumption is created 
                        that the person or entity has violated 
                        section 274A(a)(1)(A). The previous 
                        sentence shall not apply in any 
                        prosecution under section 274A(f)(1).
    (b) Citizen Attestation Pilot Program.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs 
        (3) through (5), the procedures applicable under the 
        citizen attestation pilot program under this subsection 
        shall be the same procedures as those under the basic 
        pilot program under subsection (a).
            (2) Restrictions.--
                    (A) State document requirement to 
                participate in pilot program.--The Attorney 
                General may not provide for the operation of 
                the citizen attestation pilot program in a 
                State unless each driver's license or similar 
                identification document described in section 
                274A(b)(1)(D)(i) issued by the State--
                            (i) contains a photograph of the 
                        individual involved, and
                            (ii) has been determined by the 
                        Attorney General to have security 
                        features, and to have been issued 
                        through application and issuance 
                        procedures, which make such document 
                        sufficiently resistant to 
                        counterfeiting, tampering, and 
                        fraudulent use that it is a reliable 
                        means of identification for purposes of 
                        this section.
                    (B) Authorization to limit employer 
                participation.--The Attorney General may 
                restrict the number of persons or other 
                entities that may elect to participate in the 
                citizen attestation pilot program under this 
                subsection as the Attorney General determines 
                to be necessary to produce a representative 
                sample of employers and to reduce the potential 
                impact of fraud.
            (3) No confirmation required for certain 
        individuals attesting to u.s. citizenship.--In the case 
        of a person or other entity hiring (or recruiting or 
        referring) an individual under the citizen attestation 
        pilot program, if the individual attests to United 
        States citizenship (under penalty of perjury on an I-9 
        or similar form which form states on its face the 
        criminal and other penalties provided under law for a 
        false representation of United States citizenship)--
                    (A) the person or entity may fulfill the 
                requirement to examine documentation contained 
                in subparagraph (A) of section 274A(b)(1) by 
                examining a document specified in either 
                subparagraph (B)(i) or (D) of such section; and
                    (B) the person or other entity is not 
                required to comply with respect to such 
                individual with the procedures described in 
                paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (a), but 
                only if the person or entity retains the form 
                and makes it available for inspection in the 
                same manner as in the case of an I-9 form under 
                section 274A(b)(3).
            (4) Waiver of document presentation requirement in 
        certain cases.--
                    (A) In general.--In the case of a person or 
                entity that elects, in a manner specified by 
                the Attorney General consistent with 
                subparagraph (B), to participate in the pilot 
                program under this paragraph, if an individual 
                being hired (or recruited or referred) attests 
                (in the manner described in paragraph (3)) to 
                United States citizenship and the person or 
                entity retains the form on which the 
                attestation is made and makes it available for 
                inspection in the same manner as in the case of 
                an I-9 form under section 274A(b)(3), the 
                person or entity is not required to comply with 
                the procedures described in section 274A(b).
                    (B) Restriction.--The Attorney General 
                shall restrict the election under this 
                paragraph to no more than 1,000 employers and, 
                to the extent practicable, shall select among 
                employers seeking to make such election in a 
                manner that provides for such an election by a 
                representative sample of employers.
            (5) Nonreviewable determinations.--The 
        determinations of the Attorney General under paragraphs 
        (2) and (4) are within the discretion of the Attorney 
        General and are not subject to judicial or 
        administrative review.
    (c) Machine-Readable-Document Pilot Program.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph 
        (3), the procedures applicable under the machine-
        readable-document pilot program under this subsection 
        shall be the same procedures as those under the basic 
        pilot program under subsection (a).
            (2) State document requirement to participate in 
        pilot program.--The Attorney General may not provide 
        for the operation of the machine-readable-document 
        pilot program in a State unless driver's licenses and 
        similar identification documents described in section 
        274A(b)(1)(D)(i) issued by the State include a machine-
        readable social security account number.
            (3) Use of machine-readable documents.--If the 
        individual whose identity and employment eligibility 
        must be confirmed presents to the person or entity 
        hiring (or recruiting or referring) the individual a 
        license or other document described in paragraph (2) 
        that includes a machine-readable social security 
        account number, the person or entity must make an 
        inquiry through the confirmation system by using a 
        machine-readable feature of such document. If the 
        individual does not attest to United States citizenship 
        under section 274A(b)(2), the individual's 
        identification or authorization number described in 
        subsection (a)(1)(B) shall be provided as part of the 
        inquiry.
    (d) Protection from Liability for Actions Taken on the 
Basis of Information Provided by the Confirmation System.--No 
person or entity participating in a pilot program shall be 
civilly or criminally liable under any law for any action taken 
in good faith reliance on information provided through the 
confirmation system.

SEC. 404. EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY CONFIRMATION SYSTEM.

    (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall establish a 
pilot program confirmation system through which the Attorney 
General (or a designee of the Attorney General, which may be a 
nongovernmental entity)--
            (1) responds to inquiries made by electing persons 
        and other entities (including those made by the 
        transmittal of data from machine-readable documents 
        under the machine-readable pilot program) at any time 
        through a toll-free telephone line or other toll-free 
        electronic media concerning an individual's identity 
        and whether the individual is authorized to be 
        employed, and
            (2) maintains records of the inquiries that were 
        made, of confirmations provided (or not provided), and 
        of the codes provided to inquirers as evidence of their 
        compliance with their obligations under the pilot 
        programs.

To the extent practicable, the Attorney General shall seek to 
establish such a system using one or more nongovernmental 
entities.
    (b) Initial Response.--The confirmation system shall 
provide confirmation or a tentative nonconfirmation of an 
individual's identity and employment eligibility within 3 
working days of the initial inquiry. If providing confirmation 
or tentative nonconfirmation, the confirmation system shall 
provide an appropriate code indicating such confirmation or 
such nonconfirmation.
    (c) Secondary Verification Process in Case of Tentative 
Nonconfirmation.--In cases of tentative nonconfirmation, the 
Attorney General shall specify, in consultation with the 
Commissioner of Social Security and the Commissioner of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, an available secondary 
verification process to confirm the validity of information 
provided and to provide a final confirmation or nonconfirmation 
within 10 working days after the date of the tentative 
nonconfirmation. When final confirmation or nonconfirmation is 
provided, the confirmation system shall provide an appropriate 
code indicating such confirmation or nonconfirmation.
    (d) Design and Operation of System.--The confirmation 
system shall be designed and operated--
            (1) to maximize its reliability and ease of use by 
        persons and other entities making elections under 
        section 402(a) consistent with insulating and 
        protecting the privacy and security of the underlying 
        information;
            (2) to respond to all inquiries made by such 
        persons and entities on whether individuals are 
        authorized to be employed and to register all times 
        when such inquiries are not received;
            (3) with appropriate administrative, technical, and 
        physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure 
        of personal information; and
            (4) to have reasonable safeguards against the 
        system's resulting in unlawful discriminatory practices 
        based on national origin or citizenship status, 
        including--
                    (A) the selective or unauthorized use of 
                the system to verify eligibility;
                    (B) the use of the system prior to an offer 
                of employment; or
                    (C) the exclusion of certain individuals 
                from consideration for employment as a result 
                of a perceived likelihood that additional 
                verification will be required, beyond what is 
                required for most job applicants.
    (e) Responsibilities of the Commissioner of Social 
Security.--As part of the confirmation system, the Commissioner 
of Social Security, in consultation with the entity responsible 
for administration of the system, shall establish a reliable, 
secure method, which, within the time periods specified under 
subsections (b) and (c), compares the name and social security 
account number provided in an inquiry against such information 
maintained by the Commissioner in order to confirm (or not 
confirm) the validity of the information provided regarding an 
individual whose identity and employment eligibility must be 
confirmed, the correspondence of the name and number, and 
whether the individual has presented a social security account 
number that is not valid for employment. The Commissioner shall 
not disclose or release social security information (other than 
such confirmation or nonconfirmation).
    (f) Responsibilities of the Commissioner of the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service.--As part of the confirmation 
system, the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, in consultation with the entity responsible for 
administration of the system, shall establish a reliable, 
secure method, which, within the time periods specified under 
subsections (b) and (c), compares the name and alien 
identification or authorization number described in section 
403(a)(1)(B) which are provided in an inquiry against such 
information maintained by the Commissioner in order to confirm 
(or not confirm) the validity of the information provided, the 
correspondence of the name and number, and whether the alien is 
authorized to be employed in the United States.
    (g) Updating Information.--The Commissioners of Social 
Security and the Immigration and Naturalization Service shall 
update their information in a manner that promotes the maximum 
accuracy and shall provide a process for the prompt correction 
of erroneous information, including instances in which it is 
brought to their attention in the secondary verification 
process described in subsection (c).
    (h) Limitation on Use of the Confirmation System and Any 
Related Systems.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, nothing in this subtitle shall be 
        construed to permit or allow any department, bureau, or 
        other agency of the United States Government to utilize 
        any information, data base, or other records assembled 
        under this subtitle for any other purpose other than as 
        provided for under a pilot program.
            (2) No national identification card.--Nothing in 
        this subtitle shall be construed to authorize, directly 
        or indirectly, the issuance or use of national 
        identification cards or the establishment of a national 
        identification card.

SEC. 405. REPORTS.

    The Attorney General shall submit to the Committees on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives and of the Senate 
reports on the pilot programs within 3 months after the end of 
the third and fourth years in which the programs are in effect. 
Such reports shall--
            (1) assess the degree of fraudulent attesting of 
        United States citizenship,
            (2) include recommendations on whether or not the 
        pilot programs should be continued or modified, and
            (3) assess the benefits of the pilot programs to 
        employers and the degree to which they assist in the 
        enforcement of section 274A.

              TITLE V--RESTRICTIONS ON BENEFITS FOR ALIENS

SEC. 500. STATEMENTS OF NATIONAL POLICY CONCERNING WELFARE AND 
                    IMMIGRATION.

    (a) Statements of Congressional Policy.--The Congress makes 
the following statements concerning national policy with 
respect to welfare and immigration:
            (1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of 
        United States immigration law since this country's 
        earliest immigration statutes.
            (2) It continues to be the immigration policy of 
        the United States that--
                    (A) aliens within the nation's borders not 
                depend on public resources to meet their needs, 
                but rather rely on their own capabilities and 
                the resources of their families, their 
                sponsors, and private organizations, and
                    (B) the availability of public benefits not 
                constitute an incentive for immigration to the 
                United States.
            (3) Despite this principle of self-sufficiency, 
        aliens have been applying for and receiving public 
        benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at 
        increasing rates.
            (4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance 
        and unenforceable financial support agreements have 
        proved incapable of assuring that individual aliens do 
        not burden the public benefits system.
            (5) It is a compelling government interest to enact 
        new rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in 
        order to assure that aliens are self-reliant in 
        accordance with national immigration policy.
            (6) It is a compelling government interest to 
        remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided 
        by the availability of public benefits.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) In general.--With respect to the authority of a 
        State to make determinations concerning the eligibility 
        of aliens for public benefits, it is the sense of the 
        Congress that a court should apply the same standard of 
        review to an applicable State law as that court uses in 
        determining whether an Act of Congress regulating the 
        eligibility of aliens for public benefits meets 
        constitutional scrutiny.
            (2) Strict scrutiny.--In cases where a court holds 
        that a State law determining the eligibility of aliens 
        for public benefits must be the least restrictive means 
        available for achieving a compelling government 
        interest, a State that chooses to follow the Federal 
        classification in determining the eligibility of aliens 
        for public benefits, pursuant to the authorization 
        contained in this title, shall be considered to have 
        chosen the least restrictive means available for 
        achieving the compelling government interest of 
        assuring that aliens are self-reliant in accordance 
        with national immigration policy.

            (4) Public health assistance for immunizations and,

            (1) In general.--The term ``eligible alien'' means 
        an alien--
                    (A) who is an alien lawfully admitted for

                        connection between such battery or

                                of the Act,
                                    (III) suspension of 
                                deportation and adjustment of 
                                status pursuant to section 
                                244(a)(3) of such Act, or
                                    (IV) status as a spouse or 
                                child of a United States 
                                citizen pursuant to clause (i) 
                                of section 204(a)(1)(A) of such 
                                Act, or classification pursuant 
                                to clause (i) of section 
                                204(a)(1)(B) of such Act; or

                        of the alien (without the active 
                        participation of the alien in the 
                        battery or cruelty), or by a member of 
                        the spouse or parent's family residing 
                        in the same household as the alien and 
                        the spouse or parent consented or 
                        acquiesced to such battery or cruelty, 
                        and the alien did not actively 
                        participate in such battery or cruelty, 
                        but only if (in the opinion of the 
                        Attorney General, which opinion is not 
                        subject to review by any court) there 
                        is a substantial connection between 
                        such battery or cruelty and the need 
                        for the benefits to be provided; and
                            (ii) who meets the requirement of 
                        clause (ii) of subparagraph (A).
        Such term shall not apply to an alien during any period 
        in which the individual responsible for such battery or 
        cruelty resides in the same household or family 
        eligibility unit as the individual subjected to such 
        battery or cruelty.
    (d) Ineligible Alien Defined.--For purposes of this 
section, the term ``ineligible alien'' means an individual who 
is not--
            (1) a citizen or national of the United States; or

State, in which the eligibility of an individual, household, or 
family eligibility unit for the benefit or the amount of the 
benefit, or both, are determined on the basis of income, 
resources, or financial need of the individual, household, or 
unit.
    (f) Effective Date.--

        naturalization of the alien.
            (3) Exception to general rule.--Subsection (a)

        sponsor's income and resources under this subsection 
        with respect to an alien shall terminate at such time 
        as an affidavit of support of such sponsor with respect

                and resources of the sponsor or the sponsor's 
                spouse which shall be attributed to the

                provided by the agency, be unable to obtain 
                food and shelter, taking into account the 
                alien's own income, plus any cash, food, 
                housing, or other assistance provided by other 
                individuals, including the sponsor. The agency

                symptoms of sufficient severity (including 
                severe pain) such that the absence of immediate 
                medical attention could reasonably be expected

                            (I) placing the patient's health in 
                        serious jeopardy,

                communicable disease, for testing and treatment 
                for such disease (which may not include 
                treatment for HIV infection or acquired immune 
                deficiency syndrome).
                    (E) Benefits under programs of student

the Federal Government in which the eligibility of an 
individual, household, or family eligibility unit for the 
benefit, or the amount of the benefit, or both are determined 
on the basis of income, resources, or financial need of the 
individual, household, or unit.
    (f) Special Rule for Battered Spouse and Child.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2) and 
        notwithstanding any other provision of this section, 
        subsection (a) shall not apply to benefits--
                    (A) during a 12 month period if the alien 
                demonstrates that (i) the alien has been 
                battered or subjected to extreme cruelty in the 
                United States by a spouse or a parent, or by a 
                member of the spouse or parent's family 
                residing in the same household as the alien and 
                the spouse or parent consented to or acquiesced 
                to such battery or cruelty, or (ii) the alien's 
                child has been battered or subjected to extreme 
                cruelty in the United States by the spouse or 
                parent of the alien (without the active 
                participation of the alien in the battery or 
                cruelty), or by a member of the spouse's or 
                parent's family residing in the same household 
                as the alien when the spouse or parent 
                consented or acquiesced to and the alien did 
                not actively participate in such battery or 
                cruelty, and the battery or cruelty described 
                in clause (i) or (ii) (in the opinion of the 
                agency providing such public benefits, which 
                opinion is not subject to review by any court) 
                has a substantial connection to the need for 
                the public benefits applied for; and
                    (B) after a 12 month period (regarding the 
                batterer's income and resources only) if the 
                alien demonstrates that such battery or cruelty 
                under subparagraph (A) has been recognized in 
                an order of a judge or administrative law judge 
                or a prior determination of the Immigration and 
                Naturalization Service, and that such battery 
                or cruelty (in the opinion of the agency 
                providing such public benefits, which opinion 
                is not subject to review by any court) has a 
                substantial connection to the need for the 
                benefits.
            (2) Limitation.--The exception under paragraph (1) 
        shall not apply to benefits for an alien during any 
        period in which the individual responsible for such 
        battery or cruelty resides in the same household or 
        family eligibility unit as the individual who was 
        subjected to such battery or cruelty.
    (g) Application.--
            (1) In general.--The provisions of this section 
        shall apply with respect to determinations of

        whom an application is filed on or after the first day 
        of the first month beginning more than 60 days after 
        the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (2) Redeterminations.--This section shall apply 
        with respect to any redetermination of eligibility and 
        amount of benefits occurring on or after the date 
        determined under paragraph (1).
    (h) No Deeming Requirement for Nonprofit Charitable 
Organizations.--A nonprofit charitable organization operating 
any Federal means-tested public benefit program is not required 
to deem that the income or assets of any applicant for any 
benefit or assistance under such program include the income or 
assets described in subsection (b).

SEC. 553. ATTRIBUTION OF SPONSOR'S INCOME AND RESOURCES AUTHORITY FOR 
                    STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b) and 
notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State or 
political subdivision of a State is authorized, for purposes of 
determining the eligibility of an alien for benefits and the 
amount of benefits, under any means-based public benefit 
program of a State or a political subdivision of a State (other 
than a program of assistance provided or funded, in whole or in 
part, by the Federal Government), to require that the income 
and resources of any individual under section 552(b) be deemed 
to be the income and resources of such alien.
    (b) Limitations.--
            (1) Exceptions.--Any attribution of income and 
        resources pursuant to the authority of subsection (a) 
        shall be subject to exceptions comparable to the 
        exceptions of section 552(d).
            (2) Period of deeming.--Any period of attribution 
        of income and resources pursuant to the authority of 
        subsection (a) shall not exceed the period of 
        attribution under section 552(c).

SEC. 554. AUTHORITY OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF STATES TO 
                    LIMIT ASSISTANCE TO ALIENS AND TO DISTINGUISH AMONG 
                    CLASSES OF ALIENS IN PROVIDING GENERAL CASH PUBLIC 
                    ASSISTANCE.

    (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b) and 
notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State or 
political subdivision of a State is authorized to prohibit or 
otherwise limit or restrict the eligibility of aliens or 
classes of aliens for programs of general cash public 
assistance furnished under the law of the State or a political 
subdivision of a State.
    (b) Limitation.--The authority provided for under 
subsection (a) may be exercised only to the extent that any 
prohibitions, limitations, or restrictions imposed by a State 
or political subdivision of a State are not more restrictive 
than the prohibitions, limitations, or restrictions imposed 
under comparable Federal programs. For purposes of this 
section, attribution to an alien of a sponsor's income and 
resources (as described in section 552(b)) for purposes of 
determining eligibility for, and the amount of, benefits shall 
be considered less restrictive than a prohibition of 
eligibility for such benefits.

SEC. 644. INFORMATION REGARDING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION.

    (a) Provision of Information Regarding Female Genital 
Mutilation.--The Immigration and Naturalization Service (in 
cooperation with the Department of State) shall make available 
for all aliens who are issued immigrant or nonimmigrant visas, 
prior to or at the time of entry into the United States, the 
following information:
            (1) Information on the severe harm to physical and 
        psychological health caused by female genital 
        mutilation which is compiled and presented in a manner 
        which is limited to the practice itself and respectful 
        to the cultural values of the societies in which such 
        practice takes place.
            (2) Information concerning potential legal 
        consequences in the United States for (A) performing 
        female genital mutilation, or (B) allowing a child 
        under his or her care to be subjected to female genital 
        mutilation, under criminal or child protection statutes 
        or as a form of child abuse.
    (b) Limitation.--In consultation with the Secretary of 
State, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization shall 
identify those countries in which female genital mutilation is 
commonly practiced and, to the extent practicable, limit the 
provision of information under subsection (a) to aliens from

    (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term 
``female genital mutilation'' means the removal or infibulation 
(or both) of the whole or part of the clitoris, the labia 
minora, or labia majora.

SEC. 645. CRIMINALIZATION OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the practice of female genital mutilation is 
        carried out by members of certain cultural and 
        religious groups within the United States;
            (2) the practice of female genital mutilation often 
        results in the occurrence of physical and psychological 
        health effects that harm the women involved;
            (3) such mutilation infringes upon the guarantees 
        of rights secured by Federal and State law, both 
        statutory and constitutional;
            (4) the unique circumstances surrounding the 
        practice of female genital mutilation place it beyond 
        the ability of any single State or local jurisdiction 
        to control;
            (5) the practice of female genital mutilation can 
        be prohibited without abridging the exercise of any 
        rights guaranteed under the first amendment to the 
        Constitution or under any other law; and
            (6) Congress has the affirmative power under 
        section 8 of article I, the necessary and proper 
        clause, section 5 of the fourteenth amendment, as well 
        as under the treaty clause, to the Constitution to 
        enact such legislation.
    (b) Crime.--
            (1) In general.--Chapter 7 of title 18, United 
        States Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
        following:

``Sec. 116. Female genital mutilation

    ``(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever 
knowingly circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or any 
part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of another 
person who has not attained the age of 18 years shall be fined 
under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.
    ``(b) A surgical operation is not a violation of this 
section if the operation is--
            ``(1) necessary to the health of the person on whom 
        it is performed, and is performed by a person licensed 
        in the place of its performance as a medical 
        practitioner; or
            ``(2) performed on a person in labor or who has 
        just given birth and is performed for medical purposes 
        connected with that labor or birth by a person licensed 
        in the place it is performed as a medical practitioner, 
        midwife, or person in training to become such a 
        practitioner or midwife.
    ``(c) In applying subsection (b)(1), no account shall be 
taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to 
be performed of any belief on the part of that person, or any 
other person, that the operation is required as a matter of 
custom or ritual.''.
            (2) Conforming amendment.--The table of sections at 
        the beginning of chapter 7 of title 18, United States 
        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
        item:

        United States during the period beginning on November 
        1, 1989, and ending on December 31, 1991, after being 
        denied refugee status.
    (c) Waiver of Certain Grounds for Inadmissibility.--The 
provisions of paragraphs (4), (5), and (7)(A) of section 212(a) 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act shall not apply to 
adjustment of status under this section and the Attorney 
General may waive any other provision of such section (other 
than paragraph (2)(C) and subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), or (E) 
of paragraph (3)) with respect to such an adjustment for 
humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is 
otherwise in the public interest.
    (d) Date of Approval.--Upon the approval of such an 
application for adjustment of status, the Attorney General 
shall create a record of the alien's admission as an alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence as of the date of the 
alien's inspection and parole described in subsection (b)(2).
    (e) No Offset in Number of Visas Available.--When an alien 
is granted the status of having been lawfully admitted for

outreach and ceremonial and celebratory activities.
    (b) Selection of Sites.--The Attorney General shall, in the 
Attorney General's discretion, select diverse locations for

    (a) Designation.--The United States Customs Administrative 
Building at the Ysleta/Zaragosa Port of Entry located at 797

``Timothy C. McCaghren Customs Administrative Building''.
    (b) Legal References.--Any reference in any law, 
regulation, document, record, map, or other paper of the United 
States to the building referred to in subsection (a) is deemed 
to be a reference to the ``Timothy C. McCaghren Customs 
Administrative Building''.

SEC. 652. MAIL-ORDER BRIDE BUSINESS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) There is a substantial ``mail-order bride'' 
        business in the United States. With approximately 200 
        companies in the United States, an estimated 2,000 to 
        3,500 men in the United States find wives through mail-
        order bride catalogs each year. However, there are no 
        official statistics available on the number of mail-
        order brides entering the United States each year.
            (2) The companies engaged in the mail-order bride 
        business earn substantial profits.
            (3) Although many of these mail-order marriages 
        work out, in many other cases, anecdotal evidence 
        suggests that mail-order brides find themselves in 
        abusive relationships. There is also evidence to 
        suggest that a substantial number of mail-order 
        marriages are fraudulent under United States law.
            (4) Many mail-order brides come to the United 
        States unaware or ignorant of United States immigration 
        law. Mail-order brides who are battered often think 
        that if they flee an abusive marriage, they will be 
        deported. Often the citizen spouse threatens to have 
        them deported if they report the abuse.
            (5) The Immigration and Naturalization Service 
        estimates that the rate of marriage fraud between 
        foreign nationals and United States citizens or aliens 
        lawfully admitted for permanent residence is 8 percent. 
        It is unclear what percentage of these marriage fraud 
        cases originate as mail-order marriages.
    (b) Information Dissemination.--
            (1) Requirement.--Each international matchmaking 
        organization doing business in the United States shall 
        disseminate to recruits, upon recruitment, such 
        immigration and naturalization information as the 
        Immigration and Naturalization Service deems 
        appropriate, in the recruit's native language, 
        including information regarding conditional permanent 
        residence status and the battered spouse waiver under 
        such status, permanent resident status, marriage fraud 
        penalties, the unregulated nature of the business 
        engaged in by such organizations, and the study 
        required under subsection (c).
            (2) Civil penalty.--
                    (A) Violation.--Any international 
                matchmaking organization that the Attorney 
                General determines has violated subsection (b) 
                shall be subject, in addition to any other 
                penalties that may be prescribed by law, to a 
                civil money penalty of not more than $20,000 
                for each such violation.
                    (B) Procedures for imposition of penalty.--
                Any penalty under subparagraph (A) may be 
                imposed only after notice and opportunity for 
                an agency hearing on the record in accordance 
                with sections 554 through 557 of title 5, 
                United States Code.
    (c) Study.--The Attorney General, in consultation with the 
Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization and the Director 
of the Violence Against Women Initiative of the Department of 
Justice, shall conduct a study of mail-order marriages to 
determine, among other things--
            (1) the number of such marriages;
            (2) the extent of marriage fraud in such marriages, 
        including an estimate of the extent of marriage fraud 
        arising from the services provided by international 
        matchmaking organizations;
            (3) the extent to which mail-order spouses utilize 
        section 244(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality 
        Act (providing for suspension of deportation in certain 
        cases involving abuse), or section 204(a)(1)(A)(iii) of 
        such Act (providing for certain aliens who have been 
        abused to file a classification petition on their own 
        behalf);
            (4) the extent of domestic abuse in mail-order 
        marriages; and
            (5) the need for continued or expanded regulation 
        and education to implement the objectives of the 
        Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and the Immigration 
        Marriage Fraud Amendments of 1986 with respect to mail-
        order marriages.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a 
report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of 
Representatives and of the Senate setting forth the results of 
the study conducted under subsection (c).
    (e) Definitions.--As used in this section:

                United States or any State, that does business 
                in the United States and for profit offers to 
                United States citizens or aliens lawfully 
                admitted for permanent residence, dating, 
                matrimonial, or social referral services to 
                nonresident noncitizens, by--
                            (i) an exchange of names, telephone 
                        numbers, addresses, or statistics;
                            (ii) selection of photographs; or
                            (iii) a social environment provided 
                        by the organization in a country other 
                        than the United States.
                    (B) Exception.--Such term does not include 
                a traditional matchmaking organization of a 
                religious nature that otherwise operates in 
                compliance with the laws of the countries of 
                the recruits of such organization and the laws 
                of the United States.
            (2) Recruit.--The term ``recruit'' means a 
        noncitizen, nonresident person, recruited by the 
        international matchmaking organization for the purpose 
        of providing dating, matrimonial, or social referral 
        services to United States citizens or aliens lawfully 
        admitted for permanent residence.

SEC. 653. REVIEW AND REPORT ON H-2A NONIMMIGRANT WORKERS PROGRAM.

    (a) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress 
that the H2-A nonimmigrant worker program should be reviewed 
and may need improvement in order to meet the need of producers 
of labor-intensive agricultural commodities and livestock in 
the United States for an adequate workforce.
    (b) Review.--The Comptroller General shall review the 
effectiveness of the H-2A nonimmigrant worker program to ensure 
that the program provides a sufficient supply of agricultural 
labor in the event of future shortages of domestic workers 
after the enactment of this Act. Among other things, the 
Comptroller General shall review the H-2A nonimmigrant worker 
program to determine--
            (1) whether the program ensures that an adequate 
        supply of qualified United States workers is available 
        at the time and place needed for employers seeking such 
        workers after the date of enactment of this Act;
            (2) whether the program ensures that there is 
        timely approval of applications for temporary foreign 
        workers under the program in the event of shortages of 
        United States workers after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act;
            (3) whether the program ensures that implementation 
        of the program is not displacing United States 
        agricultural workers or diminishing the terms and 
        conditions of employment of United States agricultural 
        workers;
            (4) if, and to what extent, the program is 
        contributing to the problem of illegal immigration; and
            (5) that the program adequately meets the needs of 
        agricultural employers for all types of temporary 
        foreign agricultural workers, including higher-skilled 
        workers in occupations which require a level of 
        specific vocational preparation of 4 or higher (as 
        described in the 4th edition of the Dictionary of 
        Occupational Title, published by the Department of 
        Labor).
    (c) Report.--Not later than December 31, 1996, or 3 months 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, whichever occurs 
earlier, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to the 
appropriate committees of the Congress setting forth the 
conclusions of the Comptroller General from the review 
conducted under subsection (b).

        means the program for the admission of nonimmigrant 
        aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act.

SEC. 654. REPORT ON ALLEGATIONS OF HARASSMENT BY CANADIAN CUSTOMS 
                    AGENTS.

    (a) Study and Review.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of 
        the United States Customs Service shall initiate a 
        study of harassment by Canadian customs agents 
        allegedly undertaken for the purpose of deterring 
        cross-border commercial activity along the United 
        States-New Brunswick border. Such study shall include a 
        review of the possible connection between any incidents 
        of harassment and the discriminatory imposition of the 
        New Brunswick provincial sales tax on goods purchased 
        in the United States by New Brunswick residents, and 
        with any other actions taken by the Canadian provincial 
        governments to deter cross-border commercial 
        activities.
            (2) Consultation.--In conducting the study under 
        paragraph (1), the Commissioner of the United States 
        Customs Service shall consult with representatives of 
        the State of Maine, local governments, local 
        businesses, and any other knowledgeable persons who the 
        Commissioner considers to be important to the 
        completion of the study.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of the United States 
Customs Service shall submit to the Committees on the Judiciary 
of the House of Representatives and of the Senate a report on 
the study and review conducted under subsection (a). The report 
shall include recommendations for steps that the United States 
Government can take to help end any harassment by Canadian 
customs agents that is found to have occurred.

SEC. 655. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DISCRIMINATORY APPLICATION OF NEW 
                    BRUNSWICK PROVINCIAL SALES TAX.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) In July 1993, Canadian customs officers began 
        collecting an 11 percent New Brunswick provincial sales 
        tax on goods purchased in the United States by New 
        Brunswick residents, an action that has caused severe 
        economic harm to United States businesses located in 
        proximity to the border with New Brunswick.
            (2) This impediment to cross-border trade compounds 
        the damage already done from the Canadian Government's 
        imposition of a 7 percent tax on all goods bought by 
        Canadians in the United States.
            (3) Collection of the New Brunswick provincial 
        sales tax on goods purchased outside of New Brunswick 
        is effected only along the United States-Canadian 
        border, not along New Brunswick's borders with other 
        Canadian provinces; the tax is thus being administered 
        by Canadian authorities in a manner uniquely 
        discriminatory to Canadians shopping in the United 
        States.
            (4) In February 1994, the United States Trade 
        Representative publicly stated an intention to seek 
        redress from the discriminatory application of the New 
        Brunswick provincial sales tax under the dispute 
        resolution process in chapter 20 of the North American 
        Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the United States 
        Government has still not made such a claim under NAFTA 
        procedures.
            (5) Initially, the United States Trade 
        Representative argued that filing a New Brunswick 
        provincial sales tax claim was delayed only because the 
        dispute mechanism under NAFTA had not yet been 
        finalized, but more than a year after such mechanism 
        has been put in place, the claim has still not been put 
        forward by the United States Trade Representative.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress 
that--
            (1) the provincial sales tax levied by the Canadian 
        province of New Brunswick on Canadian citizens of that 
        province who purchase goods in the United States--
                    (A) raises questions about a possible 
                violation of the North American Free Trade 
                Agreement in the discriminatory application of 
                the tax to cross-border trade with the United 
                States; and
                    (B) damages good relations between the 
                United States and Canada; and
            (2) the United States Trade Representative should 
        move forward without further delay in seeking redress 
        under the dispute resolution process in chapter 20 of 
        the North American Free Trade Agreement for the 
        violation.

                        appropriate standards for birth 
                        certificates that may be accepted for 
                        official purposes by Federal agencies, 
                        as provided in subparagraph (A).
                            (ii) Selection of lead agency.--Of

                        note the fact of death on the birth

                        developing the capability described in

                        receive a grant and in an amount needed 
                        to provide a substantial incentive for

                project in each of 5 States to demonstrate the 
                feasibility of a system under which persons 
                otherwise required to report the death of 
                individuals to a State would be required to 
                provide to the State's office of vital 
                statistics sufficient information to establish 
                the fact of death of every individual dying in 
                the State within 24 hours of acquiring the

       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2202) to amend 
the Immigration and Nationality Act to improve deterrence of 
illegal immigration to the United States by increasing border 
patrol and investigative personnel, by increasing penalties for 
alien smuggling and for document fraud, by reforming exclusion 
and deportation law and procedures, by improving the 
verification system for eligibility for employment, and through 
other measures, to reform the legal immigration system and 
facilitate legal entries into the United States, and for other 
purposes, submit the following joint statement to the House and 
the Senate in explanation of the effect of the action agreed 
upon by the managers and recommended in the accompanying 
conference report:
      The Senate amendment struck all of the House bill after 
the enacting clause and inserted a substitute text.
      The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the Senate with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
House bill and the Senate amendment. The differences between 
the House bill, the Senate amendment, and the substitute agreed 
to in conference are noted below, except for clerical 
corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements 
reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clerical 
changes.

 Title I--Improvements to Border Control, Facilitation of Legal Entry, 
                        and Interior Enforcement

             Subtitle A--Improved Enforcement at the Border

      Section 101--House recedes to sections 101 (a) and (b) of 
the Senate amendment, with modifications, and the Senate 
recedes to House section 101(c) with modifications. This 
section increases the number of Border Patrol agents by 1000 
per year from FY 1997 through 2001. It further provides that 
the Attorney General, in each fiscal year from 1997 through 
2001, may increase by 300 the number of support personnel for 
the Border Patrol. The additional border patrol agents are to 
be deployed in sectors along the border in proportion to the 
level of illegal crossings of the border in such sectors. 
Border Patrol resources should be used primarily at the border 
to deter illegal crossings and to apprehend at the earliest 
possible juncture those who have made such crossings. This 
section also requires the forward deployment of Border Patrol 
agents to provide a visible deterrent to illegal immigration, 
and includes the requirement in Senate amendment section 109 
regarding the preservation of immigration enforcement functions 
in interior areas. The managers intend that for purposes of 
this section, border sectors shall include coastal areas of the 
United States. The managers also intend, as a further deterrent 
to repeat illegal crossings, that available resources be made 
used to detain and prosecute aliens who repeatedly violate 
section 275(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
      Section 102--Senate amendment section 108 recedes to 
House section 102, with modifications, including the 
substantive provisions of sections 109 and 327 of the Senate 
amendment. This section requires the Attorney General to 
install additional fences and roads to deter illegal 
immigration. In the San Diego sector, it calls for extension of 
the new fencing to a point 14 miles east of the Pacific Ocean, 
and the construction of second and third fences, with roads 
between the fences, to provide an additional deterrent. This 
section includes a proviso (from Senate amendment section 108) 
that the design of such fencing incorporate features necessary 
to ensure the safety of Border Patrol agents. This section also 
includes provisions based on Senate amendment section 327 to 
enhance the Attorney General's ability to acquire property 
along the border for purposes of improving border controls. 
This section also provides for a limited waiver of the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 in order to facilitate a uniform 
construction of necessary fences and roads.
      Section 103--Senate amendment section 179 recedes to 
House section 103. This section authorizes the acquisition by 
the Attorney General of improved equipment and technology to 
deter illegal immigration on the border.
       Section 104--Senate recedes to House sections 104(a) and 
104(b). This section requires improvement in the Border 
Crossing Identification Card, a document issued in lieu of a 
visa to aliens from Canada and Mexico for short-term visits 
within a designated distance from the border. Such cards are 
frequently counterfeited and used by impostors. The new cards 
issued under this section will be machine-readable and contain 
security features to prevent use by impostors.
       Section 105--Senate recedes to House section 105. This 
section provides for civil money penalties for aliens 
apprehended while entering or attempting to enter the United 
States other than at a lawful port of entry.
       Section 106--House section 107 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 107. This section requires the Attorney 
General to review within 60 days of enactment all hiring 
standards of the INS, and within 180 days of enactment all 
training standards of the INS. The Attorney General shall 
submit a certification in each of fiscal years 1997 through 
2000 that all personnel hired in that year were hired in 
accordance with appropriate standards. The Attorney General 
also shall submit a report based on the review of training 
standards describing the status of efforts to improve such 
standards.
       Section 107--Senate recedes to House section 108, with 
modification. This section requires the Comptroller General, 
with the cooperation of the Attorney General and in 
consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of 
Defense, to track, monitor, and evaluate efforts to deter 
illegal entry into the United States. The Comptroller General 
shall report his findings to the Committees on the Judiciary of 
the Senate and the House of Representatives within 1 year from 
the date of enactment and every year thereafter through FY 
2000. The report shall include recommendations to increase 
border security at the land border and at ports of entry.
       Section 108--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
304. This section amends chapter 35 of title 18 to add a new 
section 758, making high-speed flight from an INS checkpoint a 
felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison. This section also 
amends INA section 241(a)(2)(A) to make an alien convicted of 
this offense deportable.
       Section 109--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
173. This section requires the Attorney General, together with 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and 
representatives of the air transport industry, to develop a 
plan for automated data collection at ports of entry. The 
Attorney General shall report to the Committees on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate within 
9 months of the date of enactment regarding the outcome of this 
joint initiative, including recommendations for legislation.
      Section 110--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
174, with modifications to include most of the substantive 
requirements from House section 113. This section will require 
the Attorney General within 2 years of enactment to establish 
an automated entry and exit control system that will (1) 
collect a record of departure for every alien departing the 
United States and match the record of departure with the record 
of the alien's arrival in the United States, and (2) enable the 
identification of lawfully admitted nonimmigrants who remain in 
the United States beyond the period authorized by the Attorney 
General. The Commissioner of the INS must submit an annual 
report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives on the operation of the system, 
including information on the number of departure records 
collected, the number of records successfully matched to 
records of arrival, and the number of nonimmigrants and other 
visitors for whom no matching departure record was obtained. 
All of this information shall include accounting by country of 
nationality of the arriving and departing aliens. Information 
on visa overstays identified through the entry and exit control 
system shall be integrated into appropriate data bases of the 
INS and the Department of State, including those used at ports 
of entry and consular offices.
       Section 111--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
322, with modifications. This section requires the Attorney 
General to submit a report by September 30, 1996, to the 
Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and 
of the Senate regarding the redeployment of border patrol 
agents.
       Section 112--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
120C. This section authorizes the appropriation of funds to 
ensure that the ``IDENT'' program operated by the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS) is expanded to apply to all 
apprehended illegal and criminal aliens.
       Section 113--Senate recedes to House section 106, with 
modification.

                Subtitle B--Facilitation of Legal Entry

       Section 121--House section 701 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 103, with modification. This section will 
require the Attorney General and Secretary of the Treasury to 
increase in FY 1997 and 1998 the number of full-time land 
border inspectors of the INS and the Customs Service to levels 
adequate to assure full staffing during peak crossing hours of 
all border crossing lanes currently in use, under construction, 
or authorized to be constructed.
       Section 122--Senate amendment section 213 recedes to 
House section 702, with modifications. This section will extend 
the authority under INA section 286(q) for commuter lane pilot 
programs through FY 2000, and raise to 6 the maximum number of 
such pilots. It also includes the authorization in Senate 
amendment section 213(b)(2) for the Attorney General to conduct 
pilot projects for automated entry, using card reading or 
similar technology, at land border ports of entry after hours 
of normal operation have ended.
       Section 123--Senate recedes to House section 703, with 
modifications. This section amends the INA to create a new 
section 235A, providing for the establishment within 2 years of 
enactment of preinspection stations at 5 of the 10 foreign 
airports serving as the last points of departure for the 
greatest number of inadmissible passengers arriving by air in 
the United States. Not later than 4 years after enactment, the 
Attorney General shall establish preinspection stations in at 
least 5 additional foreign airports, on the basis of most 
effectively reducing the number of inadmissible aliens who 
arrive in the United States. This section also requires the 
Attorney General to compile data arising from the operation of 
preinspection stations, and to establish a carrier consultant 
program to deter boarding by aliens inadmissible to the United 
States.
       Section 124--Senate recedes to House section 704. This 
section amends INA section 286(h)(2)(A)(iv) to provide that 
funds may be expended from the Immigration User Fee Account for 
the training of commercial airline personnel in the detection 
of fraudulent documents, and that not less than 5 percent of 
the funds expended out of the Account in a given fiscal year 
shall be for this purpose. This section also amends INA section 
212(f) to provide that if a commercial airline has failed to 
comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to the 
detection of fraudulent documents, including the training of 
personnel, the Attorney General may suspend the entry of aliens 
transported to the U.S. by the airline.
       Section 125--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
330. This section amends INA section 103(a) to provide that the 
Attorney General may authorize officers of a foreign country to 
be stationed at preclearance stations in the United States to 
ensure that persons traveling from or through the United States 
to that foreign country comply with that country's immigration 
and related laws. Such officers shall be authorized to perform 
duties, and shall enjoy such privileges and immunities 
necessary for the performance of such duties, as are granted to 
United States immigration officers in that foreign country 
under reciprocal agreement.

                    Subtitle C--Interior Enforcement

       Section 131--House sections 121 and 404 recede to Senate 
amendment section 102, with modifications. This section will 
authorize an increase in the number of INS investigators and 
support personnel assigned to investigate violations of INA 
sections 274A (employer sanctions) and 274C (civil document 
fraud) by 300 in each of FY 1997, 1998, and 1999. Not less than 
half of these newly-hired investigators shall be assigned to 
investigate potential violations of section 274A.
       Section 132--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
104. This section authorizes the appropriation of funds 
necessary to increase the number of investigators and support 
personnel to investigate visa overstayers by 300 in FY 1997.
      Section 133--House sections 122 and 365 recede to Senate 
amendment section 184, with modifications. This section amends 
INA section 287 to permit the Attorney General to enter into 
written agreements with State and local authorities to 
designate qualified officers or employees of the State or 
locality to perform immigration enforcement functions 
pertaining to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of 
aliens unlawfully in the United States, including the 
transportation of aliens across State lines to detention 
centers. Such functions shall be carried out at State or local 
expense and the designated officers and employees shall operate 
under the direction of the Attorney General.
      Section 134--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
316, with modification. This amendment directs that each State 
be allocated at least 10 active-duty INS agents.

 Title II--Enhanced Enforcement and Penalties Against Alien Smuggling 
                           and Document Fraud

 Subtitle A--Enhanced Enforcement and Penalties Against Alien Smuggling

      Section 201--House section 201 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 121. This section amends 18 U.S.C. 2516(1) to 
give INS the authority under such section to use wiretaps in 
investigations of alien smuggling and document fraud offenses.
      Section 202--Senate amendment section 122 recedes to 
House section 202, with modifications. This section amends 18 
U.S.C. 1961(1) to include as racketeering offenses acts 
indictable as document fraud crimes under title 18 (including 
the naturalization and citizenship document offenses specified 
in the Senate bill) or as alien smuggling offenses under 
section 274, 277, and 278 of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act. The offenses under the INA may be considered as RICO 
predicates only if committed for the purpose of financial gain.
      Section 203(a)--Senate recedes to House section 
203(a)(1). This provision amends INA section 274(a)(1) to 
increase criminal penalties in cases where an offense relating 
to alien smuggling, harboring, inducement, or transportation is 
done for the purpose of financial gain.
      Section 203(b)--House section 203(a)(2) recedes to Senate 
amendment sections 123(a) (1) and (2). This provision amends 
INA section 274 to specify criminal penalties for those who 
engage in a conspiracy to violate alien smuggling, inducement, 
harboring, and transportation prohibitions, and for those who 
aid and abet such crimes. Senate amendment sections 
123(a)(3)(B) and 123(b) recede to House section 203(b), as 
modified. This provision will increase penalties under section 
274(b) to up to 10 years imprisonment, and up to 15 years for a 
third or subsequent offense, for certain alien smuggling 
violations. House recedes to Senate amendment section 
123(a)(4), with modifications. This provision creates a new 
offense for an employer to hire an alien who the employer knows 
is not authorized to be employed in the United States, and who 
the employer also knows was brought into the United States in 
violation of INA section 274(a). In order to be liable under 
this provision, the employer must have actual knowledge both of 
the alien's unauthorized status and of the fact that the alien 
was brought into the United States illegally.
      Section 203(c)--Senate recedes to that portion of House 
section 203(b) that creates a new offense under INA section 
274(a) for smuggling an alien with reason to believe that the 
alien will commit a crime in the United States.
      Section 203(d)--Senate amendment section 123(a)(3) 
recedes to House section 203(c). This provision will change the 
standard for calculating penalties for alien smuggling crimes. 
Henceforth, an offense will be counted for each alien smuggled, 
not, as under current law, for each transaction regardless of 
the number of aliens involved.
      Section 203 (e)-(f)--House recedes to Senate amendment 
sections 123 (c)-(e), with modifications. These provisions 
require the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate 
or amend guidelines for offenders convicted of smuggling, 
harboring, inducement, or transportation of illegal aliens; 
provide emergency authority to the Sentencing Commission to 
complete this task; and make section 203 of this Act (and the 
amendments made thereby) applicable to offenses occurring on or 
after the date of enactment.
      Section 204--Senate amendment section 120 recedes to 
House section 204, with modifications. This section provides 
that the number of Assistant United States Attorneys shall be 
increased in fiscal year 1997 by at least 25, and that such 
attorneys shall prosecute persons involved in smuggling or 
harboring of illegal aliens, or other crimes involving illegal 
aliens, which would include immigration document fraud offenses 
relating to false identification documents, visas, passports, 
and citizenship and naturalization documents.
      Section 205--Senate amendment section 169 recedes to 
House section 205. This section provides authority for the INS 
to use appropriated funds for the establishment and operation 
of undercover proprietary corporations or business entities.

 Subtitle B--Enhanced Enforcement and Penalties Against Document Fraud

      Section 211--Senate amendment section 127(a)(1) recedes 
to House section 211(a). This provision increases the maximum 
term of imprisonment for fraud and misuse of government-issued 
identification documents from 5 years to 15 years. The sentence 
is increased to 20 years if the offense is committed to 
facilitate a drug-trafficking crime, and to 25 years if 
committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism. 
House recedes to Senate amendment section 127(a) (2)-(4), as 
modified. These provisions will increase penalties for document 
fraud crimes under sections 1541-1544, 1546(a), and 1425-1427 
of title 18 to 10 years for a first or second offense, 15 years 
for a third or subsequent offense, with the same enhancements 
for crimes committed to facilitate drug trafficking (20 years) 
or international terrorism (25 years). House section 211(b) 
recedes to Senate section 127 (b)-(d). These provisions require 
the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate or amend 
guidelines for offenders convicted of document fraud offenses, 
provide emergency authority to the Sentencing Commission to 
complete this task, and make section 211 (and the amendments 
made thereby) applicable to offenses occurring on or after the 
date of enactment.
      Section 212--House sections 212 and 213 recede to Senate 
amendment section 130, as modified. This section amends INA 
section 274C, regarding civil penalties for document fraud, to 
expand liability to those who engage in document fraud for the 
purpose of obtaining a benefit under the INA. New liability is 
established for those who prepare, file, or assist another 
person in preparing or filing an application for benefits with 
knowledge or in reckless disregard of the fact that such 
application or document was falsely made. New liability also is 
established for aliens who destroy travel documents en route to 
the United States after having presented such documents to 
board a common carrier to the United States. A waiver from 
civil document fraud penalties may be granted to an alien who 
is granted asylum or withholding of deportation. The amendments 
made by this section shall apply to offenses occurring on or 
after the date of enactment.
      Section 213--House section 214 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 129. This section amends INA section 274C by 
adding a new subsection (e), providing that a person who fails 
to disclose or conceals his role in preparing, for a fee or 
other remuneration, a false application for benefits under the 
INA is subject to imprisonment of not more than 5 years, and is 
prohibited from preparing, whether or not for a fee or other 
remuneration, any other such application. A person convicted 
under this section who later prepares or assists in preparing 
an application for immigration benefits, regardless of whether 
for a fee or other remuneration, is subject to imprisonment of 
not more than 15 years, and is prohibited from preparing any 
other such application.
      Section 214--Senate amendment section 128 recedes to 
House section 215. This section amends section 1546(a) of title 
18 to provide that the penalty for knowingly presenting a 
document which contains a false statement also extends to a 
document which fails to contain any reasonable basis in law or 
fact.
      Section 215--Senate recedes to House section 216. This 
section amends section 1015 of title 18 by adding new 
subparagraphs (e) and (f). New subparagraph (e) makes it 
unlawful for any person to make a false claim to United States 
citizenship or nationality for the purpose of obtaining, for 
himself or any other person, any Federal benefit or service or 
employment in the United States. New subsection (f) makes it 
unlawful for any person to make a false claim to United States 
citizenship in order to vote or register to vote in any 
Federal, State, or local election, including an initiative, 
recall, or referendum.
      Section 216--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
217(a). This section amends title 18 to add a new section 611, 
making it unlawful for any alien to vote in any election for 
Federal office, and subjects violators to fines and a term of 
imprisonment of not more than 1 year.
      Section 217--This section merges House section 221 and 
Senate amendment section 126. This section amends 18 U.S.C. 
982(a) by adding a new paragraph (6), providing that a person 
who is convicted of a violation of or of a conspiracy to 
violate sections 1425, 1426, 1427, 1541, 1542, 1543, 1544, or 
1546 of title 18, or section 1028 of title 18, or section 
274(a) of the INA, if committed in connection with passport or 
visa issuance or use, shall forfeit any conveyance used in the 
commission of the offense, as well as any property, real or 
personal, which was used or intended to be used in facilitating 
the violation, and any property constituting, derived from, or 
traceable to the proceeds of the violation. The criminal 
forfeiture shall be governed by the provisions of section 413 
(other than subsections (a) and (d)) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853).
      Section 218--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
131. This section increases penalties for violations of 
sections 1581, 1583, 1584, and 1588 of title 18 (regarding 
involuntary servitude, peonage, and slave trade offenses) from 
a maximum of 5 years to 10 years imprisonment. The section also 
requires the United States Sentencing Commission to ascertain 
if there exists an unwarranted disparity between sentences for 
such crimes and the sentences for kidnaping and alien smuggling 
offenses, and further requires the Commission to amend the 
Sentencing Guidelines to reduce or eliminate any such 
unwarranted disparity and to ensure that the Sentencing 
Guidelines reflect the heinous nature of such offenses as well 
as aggravating factors such as large numbers of victims and 
prolonged periods of peonage or involuntary servitude. The 
section also provides emergency authority to the Sentencing 
Commission to effect such changes.
      Section 219--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
124. This section permits the introduction of videotaped 
deposition testimony, in trials involving offenses under 
section 274 of the INA, of witnesses who have been deported 
from the United States or who are otherwise unavailable to 
testify, provided that there was an opportunity for cross-
examination at such deposition. This provision will permit the 
introduction, in trials for alien smuggling and related 
offenses, of critical testimony from aliens who have been 
smuggled into the United States, eliminating the need to detain 
such aliens in the United States.
      Section 220--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
120A(a)(2). This provision amends section 274C (pertaining to 
civil penalties for document fraud) to provide that immigration 
officers designated by the Attorney General may use subpoena 
authority to compel the attendance of witnesses and the 
production of documents in connection with investigating a 
complaint of civil document fraud.

   Title III--Inspection, Apprehension, Detention, Adjudication, and 
             Removal of Inadmissible and Deportable Aliens

        Subtitle A--Revision of Procedures for Removal of Aliens

      Sec. 301(a)--Senate recedes to House section 301(a), with 
modifications. Subsection (a) of this section amends INA 
section 101(a)(13) by replacing the definition of ``entry'' 
with a definition for ``admission'' and ``admitted'': the 
lawful entry of an alien into the United States after 
inspection and authorization by an immigration officer. An 
alien who is paroled under INA section 212(d)(5) shall not be 
considered to have been admitted. With certain specified 
exceptions (including in the case of an individual who has been 
absent from the United States for a period of greater than 180 
days or has committed an offense identified in section 
212(a)(2)), a returning lawful permanent resident alien (LPR) 
shall not be considered to be seeking admission.
      Sec. 301(b)--Senate amendment sections 143(b) and 317 
recede to House section 301(c), with modifications. This 
subsection redesignates paragraph (9) of INA section 212(a) as 
paragraph (10), and inserts a new paragraph (9). Under this 
subsection, an alien ordered removed under revised INA section 
235(b)(1) (see explanation of section 302 of this Act below), 
or at the end of proceedings under new section 240 (see 
explanation of section 304 of this Act below) that were 
initiated upon the alien's arrival in the United States, is 
inadmissible for a period of 5 years (or for 20 years in the 
case of a second or subsequent removal and permanently in the 
case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony). An alien 
otherwise ordered removed from the United States, or who has 
departed the United States while an order of removal is 
outstanding, shall be barred from admission for 10 years (or 
for 20 years in the case of a second or subsequent removal, and 
permanently in the case of an alien convicted of an aggravated 
felony). These bars to readmission can be waived (as in current 
law) if the Attorney General has given prior consent to the 
alien's reapplying for admission.
      This subsection also provides that an alien unlawfully 
present in the United States for a period of more than 180 days 
but less than 1 year who voluntarily departed the United States 
is barred from admission for 3 years. An alien unlawfully 
present for 1 year or more who voluntarily departs is barred 
from admission for 10 years. An alien is unlawfully present if 
the alien has been present in the United States without 
admission or parole, or remains in the United States beyond an 
authorized period of stay. No period of time in which the alien 
was present in the United States under the age of 18, as a bona 
fide applicant for asylum under section 208, or as a 
beneficiary of family unity protection, shall count towards the 
aggregate 1-year period. The calculation of time is suspended 
if the alien has filed a bona fide application for change or 
extension of status, and such application is approved. This bar 
shall not apply to an alien described in new INA section 
212(a)(6)(A)(ii) (battered spouse or child). The bar also may 
be waived, in the sole and unreviewable discretion of the 
Attorney General, for an immigrant who is the spouse or son or 
daughter of a United States citizen or lawful permanent 
resident, and the refusal of admission to the alien would cause 
extreme hardship to that citizen or lawfully resident spouse or 
parent.
      This subsection also provides that an alien who has been 
present unlawfully in the United States for more than 1 year or 
has been ordered removed from the United States, and who 
subsequently enters or attempts to enter the United States 
without being lawfully admitted, is permanently barred from 
admission. Such an alien may be admitted not earlier than 10 
years after the alien's last departure from the United States, 
but only if the Attorney General gives prior consent to the 
alien's reapplying for admission.
      Section 301(c)--Senate recedes to House section 301(b), 
with modifications. This subsection states that an alien who is 
present in the U.S. without being admitted or paroled, or who 
has arrived in the U.S. at any time or place other than as 
designated by the Attorney General, is inadmissible. This 
ground of inadmissibility shall not apply if: (I) the alien 
qualifies for immigrant status as the spouse or child of a 
United States citizen or lawful permanent resident; (II) the 
alien or the alien's child has been battered or subject to 
extreme cruelty; and (III) there was a substantial connection 
between the cruelty or battery and the alien's unlawful entry 
into the United States. As a matter of transition, the 
requirements under (II) and (III) shall not apply if the alien 
establishes that he or she first entered the United States 
prior to the effective date of Title III of this legislation, 
as set forth in section 309(a). This subsection also provides 
that an alien who without reasonable cause fails to attend or 
remain in attendance at any proceeding regarding the alien's 
removal from the United States is barred from admission for 5 
years.
      Section 301(d)--Senate recedes to House section 301(g), 
which makes a number of conforming references regarding the 
change in nomenclature in INA section 212(a) from 
``excludable'' to ``inadmissible.'' Subparagraph (B) of INA 
section 241(a)(1) (entry without inspection) will be amended to 
state that an alien present in the United States in violation 
of law is deportable. The current category of persons who are 
deportable because they have made an entry without inspection 
will, under the amendments made by section 301(c) of this bill, 
instead be considered inadmissible under revised paragraph 
(6)(A) of subsection 212(a).
      Section 302--Senate recedes to House section 302, with 
modifications. This section will amend INA section 235, 
regarding the inspection of aliens arriving in the U.S. New 
section 235(a) provides that an alien present in the United 
States who has not been admitted to the U.S., or who arrives in 
the United States, (whether or not at a designated port of 
arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United 
States after having been interdicted in international or United 
States waters), shall be deemed an applicant for admission.
      An arriving alien who is a stowaway is not eligible to 
apply for admission or to be admitted and shall be ordered 
removed upon inspection by an immigration officer. A stowaway 
shall not be eligible to apply for asylum in the United States 
unless the stowaway establishes a credible fear of persecution 
pursuant to the expedited review process in section 235(b)(1).
      Aliens seeking admission, readmission, or transit through 
the United States shall be inspected by an immigration officer, 
who shall have the same authority to take statements and 
receive evidence as under current INA section 235. An alien 
applying for admission may, at the discretion of the Attorney 
General, be permitted to withdraw the application for admission 
and depart immediately from the United States.
      New section 235(b) establishes new procedures for the 
inspection and in some cases removal of aliens arriving in the 
United States.
      Expedited Removal of Arriving Aliens: New paragraph 
(b)(1) provides that if an examining immigration officer 
determines that an arriving alien is inadmissible under section 
212(a)(6)(C) (fraud or misrepresentation) or 212(a)(7) (lack of 
valid documents), the officer shall order the alien removed 
without further hearing or review, unless the alien states a 
fear of persecution or an intention to apply for asylum. This 
provision shall not apply to an alien arriving by air who is a 
national of a Western Hemisphere nation with which the United 
States does not have diplomatic relations. The provisions also 
may be applied, in the sole and unreviewable discretion of the 
Attorney General, to an alien who has not been paroled or 
admitted into the United States and who cannot affirmatively 
show to an immigration officer that he or she has been 
continuously present in the United States for a period of 2 
years immediately prior to the date of the officer's 
determination. The purpose of these provisions is to expedite 
the removal from the United States of aliens who indisputably 
have no authorization to be admitted to the United States, 
while providing an opportunity for such an alien who claims 
asylum to have the merits of his or her claim promptly assessed 
by officers with full professional training in adjudicating 
asylum claims.
      An alien who states a fear of persecution or an intention 
to apply for asylum shall be referred for interview by an 
asylum officer, who is an immigration officer who has had 
professional training in asylum law, country conditions, and 
interview techniques comparable to that provided to full-time 
adjudicators of asylum applications. The officer shall be, for 
purposes of determinations made under this section, under the 
supervision of an immigration officer with similar training and 
substantial experience in adjudicating asylum applications. If 
the officer finds that the alien has a credible fear of 
persecution, the alien shall be detained for further 
consideration of the application for asylum under normal non-
expedited removal proceedings. If the alien does not meet this 
standard and, if the alien requests administrative review, the 
officer's decision is upheld by an immigration judge, the alien 
will be ordered removed. To the maximum extent practicable, 
review by the immigration judge shall be completed within 24 
hours, but in no case shall such review take longer than 7 
days. Throughout this process of administrative review, the 
alien shall be detained by the INS. An alien may consult with a 
person of his or her choosing before the interview, at no 
expense to the Government and without unreasonably delaying the 
interview. A ``credible fear of persecution'' means that there 
is a significant possibility, taking into account the 
credibility of the statements made by the alien in support of 
the alien's claim and such other facts as are known to the 
officer, that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum.
      There is no other administrative review of a removal 
order entered under this paragraph, but an alien claiming under 
penalty of perjury to be lawfully admitted for permanent 
residence, or to have been admitted as a refugee or granted 
asylum, shall be entitled to administrative review of such an 
order as the Attorney General shall provide by regulation. An 
alien ordered removed under this paragraph may not make a 
collateral attack against the order in a prosecution under 
section 275(a) (illegal entry) or 276 (illegal reentry).
      The availability of judicial review is described below in 
the explanation of section 306 of this Act.
      New paragraph (b)(2) provides that an alien determined to 
be inadmissible by an immigration officer (other than an alien 
subject to removal under paragraph (b)(1), or an alien crewman 
or stowaway) shall be referred for a hearing before an 
immigration judge under new section 240.
      Subsection (c) restates the provisions of current INA 
section 235(c) regarding the removal of aliens arriving in the 
United States who are inadmissible on national security 
grounds. This subsection is not intended to apply in the case 
of aliens who are inadmissible under new section 212(a)(6)(A) 
because they are already present in the United States without 
having been admitted or paroled. Such aliens could, however, be 
subject to the special removal procedures provided in Subtitle 
B of this Title.
      New subsection (d) restates provisions currently in INA 
section 235(a) authorizing immigration officers to search 
conveyances, administer oaths, and receive evidence, and to 
issue subpoenas enforceable in a United States district court.
      Section 303--Senate recedes to House section 303, with 
modifications. This section amends INA section 236, as 
described in the next paragraphs below. (The provisions in 
current section 236 regarding hearings on the exclusion of 
aliens are reflected in new section 240, as amended by section 
304 of this report.)
      New section 236(a) restates the current provisions in 
section 242(a)(1) regarding the authority of the Attorney 
General to arrest, detain, and release on bond an alien who is 
not lawfully in the United States. (The current authority in 
section 242(a) for a court in habeas corpus proceedings to 
review the conditions of detention or release pending the 
determination of the alien's inadmissibility or deportability 
is not retained.) The minimum bond for an alien released 
pending removal proceedings is raised from $500 to $1500. New 
section 236(b) restates the current provisions in section 
242(a)(1) that the Attorney General may at any time revoke an 
alien's bond or parole.
      New section 236(c) provides that the Attorney General 
must detain an alien who is inadmissible under section 
212(a)(2) or deportable under new section 237(a)(2). This 
requirement does not apply to an alien deportable under section 
237(a)(2)(A)(i) on the basis of an offense for which the alien 
has not been sentenced to at least 1 year in prison. This 
detention mandate applies whenever such an alien is released 
from imprisonment, regardless of the circumstances of the 
release. This subsection also provides that such an alien may 
be released from the Attorney General's custody only if the 
Attorney General decides in accordance with 18 U.S.C. 3521 that 
release is necessary to provide protection to a witness, 
potential witness, a person cooperating with an investigation 
into major criminal activity, or a family member or close 
associate of such a witness or cooperator, and such release 
will not pose a danger to the safety of other persons or of 
property, and the alien is likely to appear for any scheduled 
proceeding.
      New section 236(d) restates the current provisions in 
section 242(a)(3) regarding the identification of aliens 
arrested for aggravated felonies and amends those provisions to 
require that information on aliens convicted of aggravated 
felonies and deported be provided to the Department of State 
for inclusion in its automated visa lookout system.
      New section 236(e) states that no discretionary judgment 
of the Attorney General made under the authority of section 236 
shall be subject to judicial review, and that no court shall 
set aside a decision of the Attorney General regarding 
detention or release of an alien, or the granting or denial of 
bond or parole.
      Section 304--Senate recedes to House section 304, with 
modifications. This section redesignates current INA section 
239 (designation of ports of entry for aliens arriving by civil 
aircraft) as section 234, redesignates INA section 240 (records 
of admission) as section 240C, and inserts new INA sections 
239, 240, 240A, and 240B.
      New section 239 restates the provisions of current 
subsections (a) and (b) of section 242B regarding the provision 
of written notice to aliens placed in removal proceedings. 
These provisions are conformed to the establishment of a single 
removal hearing to replace the two current proceedings under 
current section 236 (exclusion) and 242 (deportation). The 
requirement that the written notice be provided in Spanish as 
well as English is not retained. The INS will determine when a 
language other than English should be used and when the 
services of a translator are necessary. The mandatory period 
between notice and date of hearing is reduced to 10 days. 
Service is sufficient if there is proof of mailing to the last 
address provided by the alien.
      New section 240 restates provisions in current sections 
236 (exclusion proceedings) and 242 and 242B (deportation 
proceedings). Section 240(a) provides that there shall be a 
single proceeding for deciding whether an alien is inadmissible 
under section 212(a) or deportable under section 237 (formerly 
section 241(a)). This subsection shall not affect proceedings 
under new section 235(c) (aliens inadmissible on national 
security grounds), new section 238 (currently section 242A) 
(aliens convicted of aggravated felonies), or new section 
235(b)(1) (arriving aliens, or aliens present in the United 
States without having been admitted or paroled, who are 
inadmissible for fraud or lack of documents).
      Section 240(b) provides that the removal proceeding under 
this section shall be conducted by an immigration judge in 
largely the same manner as currently provided in sections 242 
and 242B. Under paragraph (b)(2), the proceeding may take place 
in person, or through video or telephone conference. (Hearings 
on the merits could be conducted by telephone conference only 
with the consent of the alien). In addition, with the consent 
of the parties, the proceeding may take place in the alien's 
absence. Under paragraph (b)(4), an alien shall have a 
reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence presented 
against the alien, and to cross-examine Government witnesses, 
but not to examine national security information provided in 
opposition to the alien's admission to the United States, or in 
opposition to an alien's application for discretionary relief. 
Under paragraph (b)(5), an alien who fails to appear for a 
hearing may be ordered removed if the Service establishes by 
clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that notice under 
section 239 was provided and that the alien is inadmissible or 
deportable. There is no requirement to provide written notice 
if the alien has failed to provide the address required under 
section 239(a)(1)(F). Under paragraph (b)(5)(C), an in absentia 
order can only be rescinded through a motion to reopen filed 
within 180 days if the alien demonstrates that the failure to 
appear was due to exceptional circumstances (as defined in 
section 240(e)), or a motion to reopen filed at any other time 
if the alien demonstrates that the alien either did not receive 
notice of the hearing or was in Federal or State custody and 
could not appear. An alien who fails to appear shall, in the 
absence of exceptional circumstances, be ineligible for 10 
years for any relief under new sections 240A (voluntary 
departure) and 240B (cancellation of removal), and sections 
245, 248, and 249.
      Section 240(c) provides that the immigration judge shall 
make a decision on removability based only upon the evidence at 
the hearing. An alien applicant for admission shall have the 
burden to establish that he or she is beyond doubt entitled to 
be admitted. An alien who is not an applicant for admission 
shall have the burden to establish by clear and convincing 
evidence that he or she is lawfully present in the U.S. 
pursuant to a prior lawful admission. If the alien meets this 
burden, the Service has the burden to establish by clear and 
convincing evidence that the alien is deportable. This 
subsection also clarifies the types of evidence of criminal 
convictions that are admissible in immigration proceedings.
      An alien is limited to one motion to reconsider the 
decision of the immigration judge. Such motion shall be filed 
within 30 days of the final administrative order of removal and 
shall specify the errors of law or fact in the order. An alien 
is limited to one motion to reopen proceedings. Such motion 
shall be filed within 90 days of the final administrative order 
of removal and shall state the new facts to be proven at a 
hearing if the motion is granted. The deadline for a motion to 
reopen may be extended in the case of an application for asylum 
or withholding of removal that is based on new evidence of 
changed country conditions, evidence that was not available at 
the time of the initial hearing. In the case of an in absentia 
order of removal under section 240(b)(5), the deadline for a 
motion to reopen shall be as set forth in section 240(b)(5)(C).
      Section 240(d) provides that the Attorney General shall 
provide by regulation for the entry by an immigration judge of 
an order of removal stipulated to by the alien and the INS. 
Such an order shall be a conclusive determination of the 
alien's removability from the U.S.
      Section 240(e) defines as ``exceptional circumstances'' 
the serious illness of the alien or the serious illness or 
death of the spouse, parent, or child of the alien, and other 
exceptional circumstances that are not less compelling. The 
subsection defines ``removable'' to mean in the case of an 
alien who has not been admitted, that the alien is inadmissible 
under section 212, and in the case of an alien who has been 
admitted, that the alien is deportable under redesignated 
section 237.
      New section 240A establishes revised rules for the type 
of relief that is currently available to excludable and 
deportable aliens under section 212(c) and 244 (a)-(d). Senate 
amendment section 150 recedes to these House provisions, with 
modifications.
      Section 240A(a) provides that the Attorney General may 
cancel removal in the case of an alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence for not less than 5 years, if the alien has 
resided in the United States continuously for 7 years since 
being lawfully admitted in any status and has not been 
convicted of an aggravated felony. This provision is intended 
to replace and modify the form of relief now granted under 
section 212(c) of the INA.
      Section 240A(b)(1) provides that the Attorney General may 
cancel removal in the case of an alien who (1) has been 
physically present in the United States for a continuous period 
of at least 10 years immediately preceding the date of applying 
for such relief, (2) has been a person of good moral character, 
(3) has at no time been convicted of an offense that would 
render the alien inadmissible under section 212(a)(2)(A) or 
deportable under redesignated sections 237(a)(2) or 237(a) (3), 
and (4) establishes that removal would result in exceptional 
and extremely unusual hardship to the alien's spouse, parent, 
or child who is a citizen of the United States or an alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
      Section 240A(b)(1) replaces the relief now available 
under INA section 244(a) (``suspension of deportation''), but 
limits the categories of illegal aliens eligible for such 
relief and the circumstances under which it may be granted. The 
managers have deliberately changed the required showing of 
hardship from ``extreme hardship'' to ``exceptional and 
extremely unusual hardship'' to emphasize that the alien must 
provide evidence of harm to his spouse, parent, or child 
substantially beyond that which ordinarily would be expected to 
result from the alien's deportation. The ``extreme hardship'' 
standard has been weakened by recent administrative decisions 
holding that forced removal of an alien who has become 
``acclimated'' to the United States would constitute a hardship 
sufficient to support a grant of suspension of deportation. See 
Matter of O-J-O-, Int. Dec. 3280 (BIA 1996). Such a ruling 
would be inconsistent with the standard set forth in new 
section 240A(b)(1). Similarly, a showing that an alien's United 
States citizen child would fare less well in the alien's 
country of nationality than in the United States does not 
establish ``exceptional'' or ``extremely unusual'' hardship and 
thus would not support a grant of relief under this provision. 
Our immigration law and policy clearly provide that an alien 
parent may not derive immigration benefits through his or her 
child who is a United States citizen. The availability in truly 
exceptional cases of relief under section 240A(b)(1) must not 
undermine this or other fundamental immigration enforcement 
policies.
      Section 240A(b)(2) restates the provisions in current 
section 244(a)(3), enacted in section 40703(a)(3) of the 
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It 
provides that the Attorney General may cancel removal if the 
inadmissible or deportable alien has been subjected to extreme 
cruelty in the United States by a spouse or parent who is a 
United States citizen or lawful permanent resident; has been 
physically present in the United States for a continuous period 
of at least 3 years; has been a person of good moral character 
during such period; is not deportable or inadmissible on 
grounds related to criminal activity, national security, or 
marriage fraud; and establishes that removal would result in 
extreme hardship.
      Section 240A(b)(3) states that the Attorney General may 
adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence an alien who meets the requirements for 
cancellation of removal under section 240A(b) (1) or (2). The 
number of such adjustments shall not exceed 4,000 in any fiscal 
year.
      Section 240A(c) provides that the following categories of 
aliens shall not be eligible for cancellation of removal under 
subsections (a) and (b)(1): an alien who entered as a crewman 
after June 30, 1964; an alien who was admitted as a 
nonimmigrant exchange alien under 101(a)(15)(J) in order to 
receive graduate medical education; an alien who otherwise was 
admitted as a nonimmigrant exchange alien under section 
101(a)(15)(J), is subject to the two-year foreign residence 
requirement of section 212(e), and has not fulfilled that 
requirement or received a waiver; an alien who is inadmissible 
under section 212(a)(3) or deportable under redesignated 
section 237(a)(4) (national security and related grounds); an 
alien who is a persecutor as described in new section 
241(b)(3)(B)(i); or an alien who has previously been granted 
relief under this section, or under INA sections 212(c) or 
244(a) before the effective date of this Act.
      Section 240A(d) provides that the period of continuous 
residence or physical presence ends when an alien is served a 
notice to appear under section 239(a) (for the commencement of 
removal proceedings under section 240), or when the alien is 
convicted of an offense that renders the alien deportable from 
the United States, whichever is earliest. A period of 
continuous physical presence under section 240A(b) is broken if 
the alien has departed from the United States for any period of 
90 days, or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding 180 
days. The continuous physical presence requirement does not 
apply to an alien who has served 24 months in active-duty 
status in the United States armed forces, was in the United 
States at the time of enlistment or induction, and was 
honorably discharged.
      Section 240A(e) limits the granting of cancellation of 
removal and suspension of deportation under current section 244 
to not more than an aggregate total of 4,000 aliens per fiscal 
year. This limitation shall apply regardless of when the alien 
applied for such relief.
      New section 240B establishes new conditions for the 
granting of voluntary departure, currently governed by section 
242(b) and 244(e) of the INA. Senate amendment section 150 
recedes to these House provisions, with modifications.
      Section 240B(a) provides that the Attorney General may 
permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the 
alien's expense in lieu of being subject to removal proceedings 
under section 240 or prior to the completion of such 
proceedings, if the alien is not deportable because of 
conviction for an aggravated felony or on national security and 
related grounds. Permission to depart voluntarily under this 
subsection shall not be valid for a period exceeding 120 days 
and an alien may be required to post a voluntary departure 
bond, to be surrendered upon proof that the alien has departed 
the U.S. within the time specified. No alien arriving in the 
United States for whom removal proceedings under section 240 
are instituted at the time of arrival is eligible for voluntary 
departure under this section. Such an alien may withdraw his or 
her application for admission to the United States in 
accordance with section 235(a)(4).
      Section 240B(b) provides that the Attorney General may 
permit an alien voluntarily to depart the United States at the 
conclusion of proceedings under section 240 if the alien has 
been physically present (before the notice to appear) for at 
least one year in the United States, the alien has been a 
person of good moral character for the 5 years preceding the 
application, the alien is not deportable because of conviction 
for an aggravated felony or on national security and related 
grounds, and the alien has established by clear and convincing 
evidence that the alien has the means to depart the United 
States and intends to do so. The period for voluntary departure 
cannot exceed 60 days and a voluntary departure bond is 
required.
      Section 240B(c) provides that an alien is not eligible 
for voluntary departure if the alien was previously granted 
voluntary departure after having been found inadmissible under 
section 212(a)(6)(A) (present without admission or parole).
      Section 240B(d) provides that if an alien is permitted to 
depart voluntarily and fails to do so, the alien shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more 
than $5,000 and shall not be eligible for any further relief 
under this section or sections 240A, 245, 248, or 249 for a 
period of 10 years. The order granting voluntary departure 
shall inform the alien of these penalties.
      Section 240B(e) provides that the Attorney General may by 
regulation limit eligibility for voluntary departure for any 
class or classes of aliens.
      Section 304(c) of this Act amends INA section 242A (to be 
redesignated as section 238) to further streamline procedures 
for administrative deportation of certain criminal aliens.
      Section 305--Senate recedes to House section 305, with 
modifications. Subsection (a) of this section strikes section 
237, redesignates section 241 as section 237, and inserts a new 
section 241.
      New section 241 restates and revises provisions in 
current sections 237, 242, and 243 regarding the detention and 
removal of aliens.
      Section 241(a) provides that the Attorney General shall 
remove an alien within 90 days of the alien being ordered 
removed. This removal period shall begin when the alien's order 
is administratively final, when the alien is released from non-
immigration related detention or confinement, or, if the alien 
has appealed his order to a court and removal has been stayed, 
the date of the court's final order. The removal period is 
extended beyond 90 days if the alien refuses to apply for 
travel documents or takes other steps (other than appeals) to 
prevent removal.
      The alien shall be detained during the removal period. If 
the alien is not removed within 90 days, the alien shall be 
subject to supervision under conditions similar to those 
currently in section 242(d). An alien who has been ordered 
removed may be detained beyond the 90-day period if the alien 
is inadmissible under section 212, is removable under 
redesignated sections 237(a)(1)(c), 237(a)(2), or 237(a)(4), 
or, in the Attorney General's determination, is unlikely to 
comply with the order of removal or is a risk to the community.
      The Attorney General may not remove an alien who is 
sentenced to imprisonment until the alien is released, but 
parole, supervised release, probation, or the possibility of 
arrest are not grounds to defer removal. However, under section 
241(a)(4)(B), an alien may be removed prior to the completion 
of sentence if the alien has been convicted of a nonviolent 
offense (except for certain aggravated felonies) and removal of 
the alien is appropriate and in the best interests of the 
United States or of the State in whose custody the alien is 
held. There is no right of action against the United States or 
any State, or any officials thereof, to compel the release or 
removal of any alien under this provision.
      If an alien reenters the United States illegally after 
having been removed or departed voluntarily under an order of 
removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated and the alien 
shall be removed under the prior order, which shall not be 
subject to review. The alien is not eligible to apply for any 
relief under the INA.
      An alien who is subject to an order of removal may not be 
granted authorization to work in the United States unless there 
is no country willing to accept the alien, or the removal is 
otherwise impracticable or contrary to the public interest.
      Section 241(b) establishes the countries to which an 
alien may be removed. Subsection (b)(1) restates the provisions 
in current section 237(a); subsection (b)(2) restates the 
provisions in current sections 243 (a) and (b). Subsection 
(b)(3) restates, with some modifications, the provisions in 
current section 243(h) regarding withholding of deportation to 
a country where the alien's life or freedom would be 
threatened. Subsection (b)(3)(B) specifies that an alien is 
barred from this form of relief if, having been convicted of a 
particularly serious crime, the alien is a danger to the 
community. An aggravated felony or felonies for which the alien 
has been sentenced to an aggregate of 5 years imprisonment is 
deemed to be such a crime, but the Attorney General retains the 
authority to determine other circumstances in which an alien 
has been convicted of a particularly serious crime, regardless 
of the length of sentence.
      Section 241(c) provides that an alien arriving in the 
United States who is ordered removed shall be removed 
immediately by the vessel or aircraft that brought the alien, 
unless it is impracticable to do so or the alien is a stowaway 
who has been ordered removed by operation of section 235(b)(1) 
but has a pending application for asylum. This subsection also 
restates and revises the provisions in section 237(d) regarding 
stay of removal, and the provisions in section 237(a) regarding 
cost of detention and maintenance pending removal. These 
provisions make it clear that actual physical detention of an 
alien who has been permitted to land in the United States shall 
be the sole responsibility of the Attorney General and shall 
take place in INS facilities or contract facilities, even in 
cases where the liability for cost of detention is assigned to 
a private entity such as a carrier. It is expected that the 
rate of reimbursement charged to the carrier or other entity 
made responsible for the cost of detention of an alien shall be 
at the same per diem rate charged to the government for the 
cost of detention.
      In the case of an alien stowaway, the carrier shall be 
liable for the cost of detention incurred by the Attorney 
General. If the stowaway does not claim asylum, the only task 
is to arrange for the stowaway's departure from the United 
States. This could occur directly on the vessel of arrival, 
particularly in the case of aircraft. Due to commercial 
requirements, safety concerns, and other factors, it is often 
not practicable for the stowaway to be removed on the vessel of 
arrival, particularly in the case of commercial maritime 
vessels. For this reason, section 241(d)(2)(B) provides that an 
alien stowaway may be allowed to land in the United States for 
detention by the Attorney General or departure or removal of 
the stowaway. In such a case, the carrier shall be responsible, 
under section 241(c)(3)(A)(ii)(II), for the cost of detention 
by the Attorney General for the time reasonably necessary to 
arrange for repatriation or removal of the alien, including 
obtaining necessary travel documents. The carrier's liability 
shall not extend beyond the date on which it is ascertained 
that such travel documents cannot be obtained. It is expected 
that the carrier and the INS will work cooperatively in order 
to obtain such travel documents in an expeditious manner. In 
some circumstances, foreign governments do not cooperate in 
issuing such documents. Since circumstances in such cases vary, 
this legislation does not designate a time period beyond which 
the financial responsibility for continued detention shifts 
from the carrier to the INS. It is expected that the INS, 
through regulations or internal policy guidance, will set a 
reasonable time line and other criteria that will be applied 
uniformly in all INS districts. Such guidelines should include 
an obligation on the part of the carrier to continue efforts to 
obtain travel documents and make other arrangements for the 
departure of the stowaway from the United States.
      In the case of a stowaway who has claimed asylum and is 
being detained to pursue an application for asylum, the carrier 
shall be liable, under section 241(c)(3)(A)(ii)(III), for a 
period not to exceed 15 business days, excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and holidays. The 15-day period shall begin when the 
alien is determined, under section 235(b)(1), to have a 
credible fear of persecution and thus be eligible to apply for 
asylum, but not later than 72 hours after the actual arrival of 
the stowaway in the U.S. The 72-hour period is intended to 
provide adequate time for the Attorney General to determine if 
the stowaway has a credible fear of persecution and thus will 
be detained by the INS to pursue an asylum application. (As 
stated in new INA section 235(b)(1), this Act intends that the 
credible fear screening process, including administrative 
review, will ordinarily be completed within 24 hours or shortly 
thereafter. Additional time may be required in the case of a 
stowaway because of the unusual and sometimes dangerous 
circumstances in which a stowaway arrives in the United 
States.) Under no circumstances shall the carrier be required 
to reimburse the INS for a period of detention greater than 15 
business days, plus the portion of the initial 72-hour period 
required to determine if the stowaway is eligible to apply for 
asylum. The obligation of the carrier to pay for detention 
costs does not include an obligation for the carrier to pay for 
the cost of translators, legal counsel, or other assistance in 
preparing and presenting the stowaway's claim for asylum. It is 
expected that the INS will adopt, through regulations 
consistent with the provisions of this legislation, clear 
policy guidance regarding the conduct of interviews to 
determine if a stowaway has a credible fear of persecution.
      Section 241(d) restates the provisions in current section 
237(b) requiring the owner of the vessel or aircraft bringing 
an alien to the United States to comply with orders of an 
immigration officer regarding the detention or removal of the 
alien. This subsection also restates the provisions in section 
243(e) that any carrier (not limited to the carrier who has 
brought an alien) comply with an order of the Attorney General 
to remove to a specific destination an alien who has been 
ordered removed.
      Section 241(d) also revises and restates the requirements 
in section 273(d) regarding permission for a stowaway to land 
in the U.S. A carrier who has brought a stowaway shall, pending 
completion of the inspection of the stowaway, detain the 
stowaway on board the vessel or at another place designated by 
the INS. The carrier may not permit the stowaway to land except 
temporarily for medical treatment, for detention of the 
stowaway by the Attorney General, or for departure and removal 
of the stowaway. However, a carrier shall not be required to 
detain a stowaway who has been permitted to remain in the U.S. 
to pursue an application for asylum, who shall be detained by 
the Attorney General subject to the reimbursement requirements 
set forth in section 241(c). Furthermore, the Attorney General 
shall grant a timely request by a carrier to remove the 
stowaway on a vessel other than that on which the alien has 
arrived in the U.S., provided that the carrier pays the cost of 
removal and obtains all necessary travel documents. In this 
way, the stowaway can be rapidly repatriated to the country of 
origin, instead of being forced to remain on the vessel while 
it makes other ports of call.
      Section 241(e) restates the provisions in current 
sections 237(c) and 243(c) regarding the payment of expenses 
for removal of aliens who have been ordered removed.
      Section 241(f) restates the provisions in section 243(f) 
regarding the employment of persons to provide personal care to 
aliens requiring such care during the removal process.
      Section 241(g) amends and restates the authority in 
current section 242(c) for construction and operation of 
detention facilities. The amendment states that before the 
construction of new facilities, the Commissioner of the INS 
shall consider the availability of existing facilities for 
purchase or lease.
      Section 241(h) provides that nothing in section 241 shall 
be construed to create any substantive or procedural right or 
benefit that is legally enforceable against the United States, 
its agencies or officers, or any other person. This provision 
is intended, among other things, to prohibit the litigation of 
claims by aliens who have been ordered removed from the U.S. 
that they be removed at a particular time or to a particular 
place.
      Section 305(b) amends INA section 276(b) to establish a 
penalty of 10 years imprisonment for aliens who reenter the 
United States without authorization after having been removed 
prior to the completion of their term of imprisonment under new 
section 241(a)(4)(B).
      Section 306--Senate amendment sections 141(b) and 142 
recedes to House section 306, with modifications. This section 
amends INA section 242 to revise and restate the provisions in 
current section 106, which is repealed.
      Section 242(a) provides that a final order of removal, 
other than an order or removal under section 235(b)(1), is 
governed by chapter 158 of title 28. This is consistent with 
current section 106(a). This subsection also provides that, 
subject to the conditions stated in new section 242(e), no 
court shall have jurisdiction to review any individual 
determination or cause or claim arising from the implementation 
or operation of an order of removal under INA section 
235(b)(1), or to review, except as provided in subsection (e), 
a decision by the Attorney General to invoke section 235(b)(1), 
the application of such section to individual aliens (including 
the determination under section 235(b)(1)(B) regarding credible 
fear of persecution), or, except as provided in subsection (e), 
procedures and policies to implement section 235(b)(1). 
Individual determinations under section 235(b)(1) may only be 
reviewed under new subsection 242(e) (1)-(2).
      This subsection also bars judicial review (1) of any 
judgment whether to grant relief under section 212 (h) or (i), 
240A, 240B, or 245, (2) of any decision or action of the 
Attorney General which is specified to be in the discretion of 
the Attorney General (except a discretionary judgment whether 
to grant asylum as described in section 242(b)), or (3) of any 
decision in the case of an alien who, by virtue of having 
committed a criminal offense, is inadmissible under section 
212(a)(2) or deportable under redesignated section 237(a)(2) 
(with the exception of section 237(a)(2)(A)(i).
      Section 242(b) provides that a petition for review must 
be filed within 30 days after the final order of removal in the 
Federal court of appeals for the circuit in which the final 
order of removal under section 240 was entered. As provided in 
Senate amendment section 142, the filing of a petition does not 
stay the removal of the alien unless the court orders 
otherwise. As further provided in the Senate amendment, the 
alien shall serve and file a brief not later than 40 days after 
the final administrative record becomes available, and may file 
a reply brief not later than 14 days after service of the brief 
of the Attorney General. These deadlines may be extended for 
good cause. The petition shall be decided solely upon the 
administrative record and the administrative findings of fact 
are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be 
compelled to conclude to the contrary. A discretionary judgment 
of the Attorney General whether to grant asylum under section 
208 is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law and an 
abuse of discretion. Judicial review of all questions of law 
and fact, including constitutional and statutory claims, 
arising out of an action to remove an alien from the United 
States, is available only as part of the judicial review of a 
final order of removal under this section.
      Section 242(b) also revises and restates the provisions 
in current section 106 regarding form, service, decisions about 
eligibility for admission, treatment of a petitioner's claim 
that he or she is a national of the United States, 
consolidation of motions to reopen and reconsider with orders 
of removal, challenges to the validity of orders of removal in 
criminal proceedings, and detention and removal of alien 
petitioners.
      Section 242(c) restates the provisions in the second 
sentence of subsection (c) of current section 106 that a 
petition for review must state whether a court has upheld the 
validity of an order of removal, and if so, identifying the 
court and date and type of proceeding.
      Section 242(d) restates the provisions in the first and 
third sentences of subsection (c) of current section 106 
requiring that a petitioner have exhausted administrative 
remedies and precluding a court from reviewing an order of 
removal that has been reviewed by another court absent a 
showing that the prior review was inadequate to address the 
issues presented in the petition, or that the petition presents 
new grounds that could not have been presented in the prior 
proceeding.
      Section 242(e) provides rules for judicial review of 
orders of removal under section 235(b)(1). No court shall have 
jurisdiction or authority to enter declaratory, injunctive, or 
other equitable relief against the operation of section 
235(b)(1) (other than that specifically authorized in this 
subsection), or to certify a class under Rule 23 of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure in any action for which judicial 
review is authorized in this section. Except as provided in 
section 242(e)(3) (see next paragraph), judicial review is 
available in habeas corpus, limited to whether the petitioner 
is an alien, whether the petitioner was ordered removed under 
revised INA section 235(b)(1), and whether the petitioner can 
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is an 
alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or has been 
admitted as a refugee or granted asylum. If the court 
determines that the petitioner was not ordered removed under 
section 235(b)(1) or is an alien lawfully admitted for 
permanent residence or a refugee or asylee, the court may order 
no relief other than to require that the alien be provided a 
hearing under section 240. The habeas corpus proceeding shall 
not address whether the alien actually is admissible or 
entitled to any relief from removal.
      Section 242(e)(3) provides for limited judicial review of 
the validity of procedures under section 235(b)(1). This 
limited provision for judicial review does not extend to 
determinations of credible fear and removability in the case of 
individual aliens, which are not reviewable. Section 242(e)(3) 
provides that judicial review is available only in an action 
instituted in the United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia, and is limited to whether section 235(b)(1), or 
any regulations issued pursuant to that section, is 
constitutional, or whether the regulations, or a written policy 
directive, written policy guidance, or written procedures 
issued by the Attorney General are consistent with the INA or 
other law. Any action seeking such review must be filed within 
60 days of the implementation of the regulations, directive, 
guidance, or procedures.
      Section 242(f) provides that no court other than the 
Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or 
restrain the operation of the provisions in chapter 4 of Title 
II of the INA, as amended by this legislation, other than with 
respect to the application of the provisions to an individual 
alien against whom removal proceedings have been initiated. 
Section 242(g) provides that no court shall have jurisdiction 
to hear any cause or claim on behalf of any alien arising from 
the decision of the Attorney General to commence proceedings, 
adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien.
      Section 306(b) of this Act repeals INA section 106. 
Section 306(c) establishes that the amendments in subsections 
(a) and (b) shall apply to all final orders of exclusion, 
deportation, or removal, and all motions to reopen or 
reconsider, filed on or after the date of enactment of this 
Act. The jurisdictional bar in new section 242(g) shall apply 
without limitation to all past, pending, or future exclusion, 
deportation, or removal proceedings under the INA. Section 
306(d) makes a technical amendment to sections 440 (a), (c), 
(d), (g), and (h) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death 
Penalty Act of 1996, Public Law 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (April. 
24, 1996) (Public Law 104-132) (``AEDPA''), to clarify the 
circumstances in which aliens with multiple criminal 
convictions are barred from relief or subject to special 
procedures to effect their removal from the United States.
      Section 307--Senate recedes to House section 307. Section 
307(a) amends INA section 243(a) to restate the provisions in 
current INA section 242(e) regarding penalties for failure to 
depart within 90 days of the order of removal. New section 
243(b) restates the provisions in the third (and final) 
sentence of current INA section 242(d) regarding penalties for 
failure to comply with the terms of release under supervision 
pursuant to section 241(a)(3) (currently the first two 
sentences of section 242(d)). New section 243(c) restates the 
provisions in the second and third sentences of current section 
237(d) and the final clause of current section 243(e) regarding 
penalties for failure to comply with an order to remove an 
alien from the United States, including civil money penalties 
and limitations on the clearance of vessels. New section 243(d) 
revises and restates the provisions in current section 243(g) 
regarding sanctions against a country that refuses to accept an 
alien ordered removed who is a citizen, subject, national, or 
resident of that country. Under the amendment, the Secretary of 
State shall order that the issuance of both immigrant and 
nonimmigrant visas to citizens, nationals, subjects, or 
nationals of that country be suspended until the country has 
accepted the alien.
      Section 308--Senate recedes to House section 308. This 
section makes a series of redesignations and conforming 
amendments in addition to those made in other sections. (The 
following list includes amendments made in other sections).
            Current section 232 is redesignated as section 
        232(a).
            Current section 234 is redesignated as section 
        232(b).
            Current section 238 is redesignated as section 233.
            Current section 240 is redesignated as section 
        240C.
            Current section 242A is redesignated as section 
        238, with conforming amendments.
            Current section 242B is stricken.
            Current section 244 is stricken.
            Current section 244A is redesignated as section 
        244.
      The provisions in current section 237(e) regarding the 
removal of an arriving alien who is helpless from sickness or 
mental or physical disorder are restated as a new section 
232(c). Section 212(a)(10)(B), the redesignated ground of 
inadmissibility for an alien who is ordered to accompany such a 
helpless alien during removal, also is amended to conform to 
the amendments in new section 232(c).
      Section 273(a) is amended by adding a new paragraph (2) 
to restate the provisions in current section 237(b)(5) 
prohibiting a carrier from taking any consideration contingent 
on whether an alien is admitted to or ordered removed from the 
U.S. Section 273(d) is repealed.
      Section 309--Senate recedes to House section 309. This 
section establishes general effective dates and transition 
provisions for the amendments made by this subtitle. Subsection 
(a) provides that, except as otherwise provided, the changes 
made in this subtitle shall take effect on the first day of the 
first month beginning more than 180 days after the date of 
enactment. Subsection (b) provides that the Attorney General 
shall promulgate regulations to carry out this subtitle at 
least 1 month before the effective date in subsection (a). 
Subsection (c) provides for the transition to new procedures in 
the case of an alien already in exclusion or deportation 
proceedings on the effective date. In general, the amendments 
made by this subtitle shall not apply and the proceedings 
(including judicial review) shall continue to be conducted 
without regard to such amendments. The Attorney General may 
elect to apply the new procedures in a case in which an 
evidentiary hearing under current section 236 (exclusion) or 
sections 242 and 242B (deportation) has not been commenced as 
of the effective date. The Attorney General shall provide 
notice of such election to the alien, but the prior notice of 
hearing and order to show cause served upon the alien shall be 
effective to retain jurisdiction over the alien.
      The Attorney General also may elect, in a case in which 
there has been no final administrative decision, to terminate 
proceedings without prejudice to the Attorney General's ability 
to initiate new proceedings under the amendments made by this 
subtitle. Determinations in the terminated proceeding shall not 
be binding in the new proceeding.
      This subsection also provides that in the case where a 
final order of exclusion or deportation is entered more than 30 
days after the date of enactment and before the Title III-A 
effective date (180 days after enactment), transitional rules 
similar to those established in section 305 of this Act 
(revised INA section 241) shall apply to petitions for judicial 
review filed prior to the Title III-A effective date. Under 
these transitional rules, all judicial review, both of 
exclusion and deportation decisions, shall be by petition for 
review to the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in 
which the final administrative order was entered. The petition 
for review also must be filed not later than 30 days after the 
final order of exclusion or deportation. The new limitations on 
appeals in the case of claims for discretionary relief or in 
the case of criminal aliens, and the new rule providing for no 
automatic stay of removal, are to take effect in all cases for 
which a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is 
entered after the date of enactment. Regardless of the date of 
entry of the final order of exclusion or deportation, if the 
petition for review is filed after the Title III-A effective 
date, then the permanent changes made by section 306 of this 
bill shall apply exclusively to such petition for review.
      The rules under new section 240A(d) (1) and (2) regarding 
continuous physical presence in the United States as a 
criterion for eligibility for cancellation of removal shall 
apply to any notice to appear (including an Order to Show Cause 
under current section 242A) issued after the date of enactment 
of this Act.

                 subtitle b--criminal alien provisions

      Section 321--House section 802 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 161. This section amends INA section 
101(a)(43) (as amended by section 440(e)) of the AEDPA (Public 
Law 104-132)), the definition of ``aggravated felony,'' by: 
adding crimes of rape and sexual abuse of a minor; lowering the 
fine threshold for crimes relating to money laundering and 
certain illegal monetary transactions from $100,000 to $10,000; 
lowering the imprisonment threshold for crimes of theft, 
violence, racketeering, and document fraud from 5 years to 1 
year; and lowering the loss threshold for crimes of tax evasion 
and fraud and deceit from $200,000 to $10,000. This section 
also adds new offenses to the definition relating to gambling, 
bribery, perjury, revealing the identity of undercover agents, 
and transporting prostitutes. It deletes the requirement that a 
crime of alien smuggling be for commercial advantage in order 
to be considered an aggravated felony, but exempts a first 
offense involving solely the alien's spouse, child or parent. 
The amendment provides that the amended definition of 
``aggravated felony'' applies to offenses that occurred before, 
on, or after the date of enactment.
      This section also provides, in section 321(c), that there 
shall be no ex post facto application of this amended 
definition in the case of prosecutions under INA section 276(b) 
(for illegal re-entry into the United States after deportation 
when the deportation was subsequent to a conviction for an 
aggravated felony). Thus, an alien whose deportation followed 
conviction for a crime or crimes, none of which met the 
definition of aggravated felony under INA section 101(a)(43) 
prior to the enactment of this bill, but at least one of which 
did meet the definition after such enactment, may only be 
prosecuted under INA section 276(b) for an illegal entry that 
occurs on or after the date of enactment of this bill.
      Section 322--Senate recedes to House section 351. This 
section amends section 101(a) of the INA to add a new paragraph 
(48), defining conviction to mean a formal judgment of guilt 
entered by a court. If adjudication of guilt has been withheld, 
a judgment is nevertheless considered a conviction if (1) the 
judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has 
pleaded guilty or nolo contendere and (2) the judge has imposed 
some form of punishment or restraint on liberty. This section 
also provides that any reference in the INA to a term of 
imprisonment or sentence shall include any period of 
incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law 
regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of 
that imprisonment or sentence.
      This section deliberately broadens the scope of the 
definition of ``conviction'' beyond that adopted by the Board 
of Immigration Appeals in Matter of Ozkok, 19 I&N Dec. 546 (BIA 
1988). As the Board noted in Ozkok, there exist in the various 
States a myriad of provisions for ameliorating the effects of a 
conviction. As a result, aliens who have clearly been guilty of 
criminal behavior and whom Congress intended to be considered 
``convicted'' have escaped the immigration consequences 
normally attendant upon a conviction. Ozkok, while making it 
more difficult for alien criminals to escape such consequences, 
does not go far enough to address situations where a judgment 
of guilt or imposition of sentence is suspended, conditioned 
upon the alien's future good behavior. For example, the third 
prong of Ozkok requires that a judgment or adjudication of 
guilt may be entered if the alien violates a term or condition 
of probation, without the need for any further proceedings 
regarding guilt or innocence on the original charge. In some 
States, adjudication may be ``deferred'' upon a finding or 
confession of guilt, and a final judgment of guilt may not be 
imposed if the alien violates probation until there is an 
additional proceeding regarding the alien's guilt or innocence. 
In such cases, the third prong of the Ozkok definition prevents 
the original finding or confession of guilt to be considered a 
``conviction'' for deportation purposes. This new provision, by 
removing the third prong of Ozkok, clarifies Congressional 
intent that even in cases where adjudication is ``deferred,'' 
the original finding or confession of guilt is sufficient to 
establish a ``conviction'' for purposes of the immigration 
laws. In addition, this new definition clarifies that in cases 
where immigration consequences attach depending upon the length 
of a term of sentence, any court-ordered sentence is considered 
to be ``actually imposed,'' including where the court has 
suspended the imposition of the sentence. The purpose of this 
provision is to overturn current administrative rulings holding 
that a sentence is not ``actually imposed'' in such cases. See 
Matter of Castro, 19 I&N Dec. 692 (BIA 1988); In re Esposito, 
Int. Dec. 3243 (BIA, March 30, 1995).
      Section 323--Senate recedes to House section 363. This 
section amends section 263(a) to authorize the registration by 
the Attorney General of aliens who are or who have been on 
criminal probation or criminal parole within the U.S.
      Section 324--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
156(b). This section amends INA section 276(a)(1) to extend 
criminal liability for an alien who reenters the United States 
without authorization to an alien who has departed the United 
States while an order of exclusion or deportation is 
outstanding.
      Section 325--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
170B. This section amends section 2424 of title 18 to expand 
the registration requirements for those who control or harbor 
alien prostitutes to require earlier filing and to cover aliens 
of all nationalities.
      Section 326--Senate recedes to House section 361. This 
section amends section 130002(a) of the Violent Crimes Control 
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (VCCLEA) to require that the 
criminal alien identification system be used to assist Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement agencies in identifying and 
locating aliens who may be removable on account of criminal or 
other grounds. The system shall provide for recording of 
fingerprints of aliens previously arrested and removed into 
appropriate automated identification systems.
      Section 327--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
313. This section amends section 130002(b) of VCCLEA (criminal 
alien tracking center) to establish an authorization for 
appropriations of $5 million per year for each of fiscal years 
1997 through 2001.
      Section 328--Senate recedes to House section 305(b) and 
843, with modifications. This section amends redesignated INA 
section 241(i) to provide that funds under the State Criminal 
Alien Assistance Program may be used for the costs of 
imprisonment of criminal aliens in a State or local prison or 
jail, including a jail operated by a municipality. This section 
also states the sense of Congress that SCAAP funds be 
distributed on a more expeditious basis. The managers 
anticipate that States will consult with counties and 
municipalities regarding their respective costs of detaining 
illegal aliens.
      Section 329--Senate amendment section 170D recedes to 
House section 356. This section provides authorization for the 
Attorney General to conduct a 6-month pilot project to identify 
criminal aliens incarcerated in local governmental prison 
facilities in Anaheim, California.
      Section 330--House section 360 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 170. This section advises the President to 
negotiate and renegotiate bilateral prisoner transfer treaties 
to expedite the transfer to their countries of nationality of 
aliens subject to incarceration who are unlawfully in the 
United States or are subject to deportation or removal. The 
negotiations are to ensure that a transferred prisoner serves 
the balance of the sentence imposed by the United States, and 
to eliminate any requirement of prisoner consent to such 
transfer. The President shall submit an annual certification to 
the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives, on whether each prisoner transfer treaty in 
force is effective in returning criminal aliens to their 
countries of nationality.
      Section 331--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
170A. This section requires the Secretary of State and Attorney 
General, within 180 days of the date of enactment, to submit to 
the Committees on the Judiciary of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives a report describing the use and effectiveness 
of the prisoner transfer treaties with the three countries with 
the greatest number of their nationals incarcerated in the 
United States. This section specifies information that shall be 
provided in such report, and requires the report to include 
recommendations to increase the effectiveness and use of, and 
compliance with, such treaties.
      Section 332--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
168. This section requires the Attorney General, not later than 
12 months after the date of enactment, to issue a report 
detailing populations of alien felons incarcerated in Federal 
and State prisons, and programs and plans to remove such aliens 
who are inadmissible or deportable, and to prevent their 
illegal reentry into the United States.
      Section 333--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
320. This section requires the United States Sentencing 
Commission to review and amend current guidelines applicable to 
offenders convicted of conspiring with or aiding and abetting 
an alien in committing an offense under section 1010 of the 
Controlled Substance Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960).
      Section 334--Senate recedes to House section 357. House 
recedes to Senate amendment section 156(b). This section 
instructs the Sentencing Commission to promptly promulgate 
amendments to the sentencing guidelines to reflect the 
amendments made in section 130001 and 130009 of the Violent 
Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

     Subtitle C--Revision of Grounds for Exclusion and Deportation

      Section 341--Senate recedes to House section 301(f). This 
subsection amends INA section 212(a)(1)(A) by adding a new 
clause (ii), making inadmissible any alien who seeks admission 
as an immigrant who does not present evidence of vaccination 
against mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus and diphtheria 
toxoids, pertussis, influenza type B and hepatitis B, and any 
other vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee for 
Immunization Practices. This subsection also provides that this 
new ground of inadmissibility may be waived if the alien 
receives the required vaccination, if a civil surgeon or 
similar official designated in 42 CFR 34.2 certifies that the 
vaccination would not be medically appropriate, or, if the 
vaccination would be contrary to the alien's religious or moral 
beliefs. It is anticipated that this waiver authority would be 
exercised in appropriate cases to permit admission of aliens 
where, for example, an alien has been unable to receive a safe 
dosage or vaccine in the alien's country of nationality, the 
alien is a child who is required to complete a series of 
vaccinations over a course of time and has not had a reasonable 
opportunity to complete that course, or the alien is an active 
member of a religious faith that notifies the Attorney General 
that such vaccinations would contradict the fundamental tenets 
of such religion.
      Section 342--House recedes to Senate section 158. This 
section amends the terrorist exclusion ground, section 
212(a)(3)(B), to make inadmissible an alien who, with the 
intent to cause death or serious bodily harm, has incited 
terrorist activity.
      Section 343--House section 811 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 155. This section amends section 212(a)(5) to 
make inadmissible to the United States any alien seeking 
admission for employment as a health-care worker unless the 
alien presents a certificate from the Commission on Graduates 
of Foreign Nursing Schools or an equivalent independent 
credentialing organization (approved by the Attorney General in 
consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services) 
verifying the alien's training, licensing, and experience, as 
well as a level of competency in English appropriate to the 
position in which the alien will be employed.
      Notwithstanding any international trade agreements or 
treaties, a ``health care worker'' subject to prescreening 
under this section should include any alien seeking an 
immigrant or nonimmigrant visa as a nurse, physical therapist, 
occupational therapist, speech-language pathologist, medical 
technologist and technician, physician assistant, or other 
occupations designated in regulations. The Attorney General 
should not approve a credentialing organization unless the 
organization is independent and free of material conflicts of 
interest regarding whether an alien receives a visa. The 
organization also should demonstrate an ability to evaluate 
both the foreign credentials appropriate for the profession and 
the results of examinations for proficiency in English 
appropriate for the health care of the kind in which the alien 
will be engaged, and maintain comprehensive and current 
information on foreign educational institutions, ministries of 
health and foreign health care licensing jurisdictions. In 
addition, because this provision contemplates that alien 
health-care workers be screened before they arrive in the 
United States, such organizations should demonstrate an ability 
to conduct examinations outside the United States.
      Section 344--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
216. This section amends INA section 212(a)(6)(C) and 241(a)(3) 
to create new grounds of inadmissibility and deportability in 
the case of an alien who falsely represents himself to be a 
citizen of the United States.
      Section 345--Senate recedes to House section 362, with 
modifications. Subsection (a) of this section amends 
subparagraph 212(a)(6)(F) and adds a new paragraph 212(d)(12), 
to provide that an alien who is inadmissible for having been 
subject to a final order for a violation of section 274C (civil 
document fraud) may have the ground of inadmissibility waived 
if the alien is a lawful permanent resident or an alien seeking 
admission as a family-sponsored or employment-based immigrant, 
and, if no civil money penalty had been imposed, the final 
order resulted from an offense that was committed solely to 
assist an individual who at the time of the document fraud 
offense was the alien's spouse or child (and not another 
individual). This statutory language makes clear that the 
family relationship must exist at the time of the civil 
document fraud offense, not merely at the time the application 
for the waiver is filed.
      Subsection (b) amends subparagraph 241(a)(3)(C) (prior to 
redesignation as section 237(a)(3)(C)) to provide a similar 
waiver for an alien who is deportable due to a section 274C 
violation. The same limitations on family relationship are to 
apply. No court shall have jurisdiction to review a decision 
whether or not to grant a waiver under either of these 
subsections.
      Section 346--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
214(b), with modifications. This section amends INA section 
212(a)(6) to add a new subparagraph (G), making inadmissible 
for 5 years any alien who obtains a visa as a nonimmigrant 
student under section 101(a)(15)(F)(i) and who violates a term 
or condition of the nonimmigrant status.
      Section 347--House recedes to Senate amendment sections 
217(b) and 217(c). This section adds new sections 212(a)(10)(F) 
and 241(a)(7) creating, respectively, new grounds of 
inadmissibility and deportability in the case of an alien who 
has voted in an election in violation of any Federal, State, or 
local constitutional provision, statute, ordinance, or 
regulation.
      Section 348--Senate recedes to House section 301(h), with 
modifications. This section amends INA section 212(h) to limit 
waivers granted under that provision in the case of an 
immigrant previously admitted to the United States. An alien is 
ineligible for such a waiver if, since admission as a lawful 
permanent resident, the alien has been convicted of an 
aggravated felony, or if the alien has not lawfully resided in 
the United States for a continuous period of 7 years prior to 
notification to the alien of the initiation of proceedings to 
remove the alien from the United States. The managers intend 
that the provisions governing continuous residence set forth in 
INA section 240A as enacted by this legislation shall be 
applied as well for purposes of waivers under INA section 
212(h).
      Section 349--Senate recedes to House section 301(d), with 
modifications. This subsection revises INA section 212(i) to 
provide that the ground of inadmissibility under section 
212(a)(6)(C) (fraud and misrepresentation) may be waived in the 
case of a spouse, son, or daughter of a United States citizen 
or of a lawful permanent resident, if the refusal of admission 
would result in extreme hardship to the citizen or lawfully 
resident spouse or parent. No court shall have jurisdiction to 
review a decision regarding such a waiver.
      Section 350--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
218 with modifications. This section amends INA section 
241(a)(2) (prior to redesignation as section 237(a)(2)) to 
provide that an alien convicted of crimes of domestic violence, 
stalking, or child abuse is deportable. The crimes of rape and 
sexual abuse of a minor are elsewhere classified as aggravated 
felonies under INA section 101(a)(43), thus making aliens 
convicted of those crimes deportable and ineligible for most 
forms of immigration benefits or relief from deportation.
      Section 351--This section amends INA sections 212(d)(11) 
and 241(a)(1)(E)(iii), regarding waivers, respectively, of 
excludability and deportability in the case of an alien who has 
engaged in alien smuggling if the act of smuggling was solely 
to aid certain close family members. The amendment clarifies 
that the family relationship must exist at the time of the act 
of smuggling. Thus, an alien does not qualify for the waiver if 
the spousal or parent-child relationship is established after 
the offense, but prior to the date of application for the 
waiver. The managers specifically disapprove of and intend to 
override the recent contrary holding of the Board of 
Immigration Appeals. See Matter of Farias, Int. Dec. 3269 (BIA 
1996).
      Section 352--Senate recedes to House section 301(e), with 
modification to make the ground of inadmissibility applicable 
to those who renounce citizenship after enactment.
      Section 353--This section identifies other sections of 
this Act that make changes to grounds of inadmissibility or 
deportability.

                Subtitle D--Removal of Alien Terrorists

      Section 354--Senate recedes to House section 321, with 
modifications. This section amends INA section 504, as enacted 
by section 401 of AEDPA (Public Law 104-132), to provide, among 
other things, that the special deportation procedures employed 
in the case of an alien terrorist may proceed in the event that 
no summary of classified evidence being used against the alien 
can be provided to the alien without disclosing classified 
information. In such circumstances, a special attorney shall be 
appointed for the alien (in addition to the attorney who may 
have been appointed to represent the alien in the main 
proceedings). The special attorney shall be entitled to review 
the classified evidence that is not disclosed or summarized for 
the alien, but may not disclose that information to any other 
person, including to the alien.
      Section 355--Senate recedes to House section 331, with 
modifications. This section amends INA section 
212(a)(3)(B)(i)(IV) as inserted by section 411(1)(C) of AEDPA 
to clarify that when a member of an organization which engages 
in or actively supports or advocates terrorist activity is 
excludable from the United States.
      Section 356--Senate recedes to House section 331, with 
modifications. This section amends section 219(b), as added by 
section 302(a) of AEDPA, to clarify the standard for judicial 
review of a designation of an organization as a terrorist 
organization.
      Section 357--Senate recedes to House section 332. This 
section clarifies that relief under INA section 244(e)(2) 
(voluntary departure) is not available to an alien in 
proceedings under Title V of the INA, as inserted by AEDPA.
      Section 358--This section provides that the effective 
date for the provisions in this subtitle shall be effective as 
if included in the enactment of subtitle A of title IV of 
AEDPA, as enacted on April 24, 1996.

                  Subtitle E--Transportation of Aliens

      Section 361--Senate amendment section 151(a) recedes to 
House section 341. This section amends INA section 101 to add a 
new paragraph (47), defining ``stowaway'' to mean any alien who 
obtains transportation without consent including through 
concealment. A passenger who boards with a valid ticket is not 
to be considered a stowaway.
      Section 362--Senate recedes to House amendment section 
343. This section amends INA section 238, before redesignation 
as section 233, to clarify that the authority of the INS to 
enter into contracts with carriers who transport aliens to the 
United States applies regardless of the point of departure of 
such aliens, and is not limited to departures from contiguous 
territories. The authority also is extended to cover 
transportation by rail.

                   Subtitle F--Additional Provisions

      Section 371--Senate amendment section 183 recedes to 
House section 352, with modifications. Subsection (a) amends 
paragraph (4) of section 101(b) to replace the definition of 
``special inquiry officer'' with a definition of ``immigration 
judge'': an attorney designated by the Attorney General as an 
administrative judge within the Executive Office for 
Immigration Review to conduct proceedings, including 
proceedings under section 240. Subsection (b) substitutes the 
term ``immigration judge'' for ``special inquiry officer'' 
wherever it appears in the INA.
       Subsection (c) establishes a four-level pay scale for 
immigration judges, beginning at 70 percent and reaching 92 
percent of the next-to-highest rate of basic pay for the Senior 
Executive Service.
      Section 372--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
171(c). This section amends INA section 103(a) to provide that 
in the event of a mass influx of aliens off the coast of the 
United States or at a land border, the Attorney General may 
authorize a State or local law enforcement officer, with the 
consent of the officer's superiors, to perform duties of 
immigration officers under the INA.
      Section 373--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
329. This section amends INA section 103(a) to clarify the 
authority of the Attorney General to use appropriated funds for 
the care and security of individuals detained by the Service 
through agreements with State and local governments. This 
provision also grants authority for the Attorney General to 
contract with State and local authorities for construction, 
renovation, and acquisition of equipment in support of the 
detention of aliens held by the INS in State and local 
facilities.
      Section 374--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
165(a)(2)(A), with modifications, and Senate amendment section 
167. This section extends the authority for judicial 
deportation under INA section 242A(c) (redesignated as section 
238(c)) to any case in which an alien is deportable. This 
section also clarifies that no denial of a request for a 
judicial order of deportation (including a decision on the 
merits) shall preclude the Attorney General from initiating 
deportation proceedings before an immigration judge on the same 
or different ground of deportability. Finally, this section 
permits the entry of a stipulated order of deportation as part 
of a plea agreement.
      Section 375--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
181. This section amends INA section 245(c) to make ineligible 
for adjustment of status aliens who are not in lawful 
nonimmigrant status, who have violated the terms of their 
nonimmigrant visa, or who have engaged in unauthorized 
employment.
      Section 376--Senate recedes to House section 808, with 
modifications. This section amends INA section 245(i) to 
provide that an alien applying for adjustment of status under 
this provision shall pay a fee of $1,000, not less than $800 of 
which shall be paid into an Immigration Detention Account. This 
section also amends INA section 286 to provide for creation and 
operation of the Immigration Detention Account.
      Section 377--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
180. This section amends INA section 245A to put an end to 
litigation seeking to extend the amnesty provisions of the 
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and to limit claims 
under that section to aliens who in fact filed an application 
for legalization under that section within the prescribed time 
limits, or attempted to do so but their application was refused 
by an immigration officer.
      Section 378--Senate amendment section 176 recedes to 
House section 353. This section amends section 246(a) of the 
INA to clarify that the Attorney General is not required to 
rescind the lawful permanent resident status of a deportable 
alien separate and apart from the removal proceeding under 
section 240.
      Section 379--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
323, with modifications. This section amends sections 274A and 
274C to clarify when the decision and order of an 
administrative law judge under these sections becomes final.
      Section 380--Senate amendment section 143(a) recedes to 
House section 354. This section adds a new section 274D to the 
INA, providing that aliens under an order of removal who 
willfully fail to depart or to take actions necessary to permit 
departure (e.g., apply for travel documents) are subject to a 
civil penalty of up to $500 for each day in violation. This 
section would not diminish the criminal penalties at section 
243(a) (for failure to depart) or at any other section of the 
INA.
      Section 381--Senate recedes to House section 355. This 
section clarifies that the grant of jurisdiction under section 
279 of the INA is to permit the Government to institute 
lawsuits for enforcement of provisions of the INA, not for 
private parties to sue the Government. This has no effect on 
other statutory or constitutional grounds for private suits 
against the Government.
      Section 382--Senate recedes to House section 359. This 
section amends section 280(b) to provide for establishment of 
an Immigration Enforcement Account, into which shall be 
deposited the civil penalties collected under sections 240B(d), 
274C, 274D, and 275(b), as amended by this bill. The collected 
funds shall be used for specified immigration enforcement 
purposes.
      Section 383--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
319, with modifications. This section amends section 301 of the 
Immigration Act of 1990 to exclude from ``family unity'' 
protection aliens who have committed certain serious offenses 
while juveniles.
      Section 384--Senate amendment section 331 recedes to 
House section 364, with modifications. This section provides 
that the Attorney General shall not make an adverse 
determination of admissibility or deportability against an 
alien or an alien's child, using information furnished solely 
by certain individuals who have battered or subjected to 
extreme cruelty that alien or that alien's child, unless the 
alien has been convicted of a crime identified in redesignated 
section 237(a)(2). Neither shall the Attorney General permit 
use by, or disclosure to any person (other than an officer of 
the Department of Justice for official and certain other 
designated purposes) of any information that relates to an 
alien who is the beneficiary of an application for relief 
(which has not been denied) under section 204(a)(1) (A) and (B) 
(self-petition for immigrant visa by alien who has been 
battered or subject to extreme cruelty), section 216(c)(4)(C) 
(hardship waiver allowing removal of conditional permanent 
resident status based on qualifying marriage because alien 
spouse or child has been subject to battery or extreme 
cruelty), or section 244(a)(3) (suspension of deportation for 
alien spouse or child who has been subject to battery or 
extreme cruelty). Civil penalties are established for willful 
violations.
      Section 385--Senate amendment section 148 recedes to 
House section 358. This section authorizes to be appropriated 
beginning in fiscal year 1996 the sum of $150,000,000 for costs 
associated with the removal of inadmissible or deportable 
aliens, including costs of detention of such aliens pending 
their removal. This section is intended to authorize sufficient 
funds in fiscal year 1996 for the hiring of 475 detention and 
deportation officers and support personnel and 475 
investigators and support personnel.
      Section 386--Subsection (a): House section 303(b) recedes 
to Senate amendment section 106. This section requires, subject 
to appropriations, an increase in INS detention facilities to 
9,000 beds by the end of FY 1997. Subsection (b): House recedes 
to Senate amendment section 182, with modifications. This 
subsection requires that within 6 months of the date of 
enactment, and every 6 months thereafter, the Attorney General 
shall submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives estimating the amount 
of detention space that will be required in the current fiscal 
year, and in each of the succeeding 5 fiscal years, to detain 
all aliens required to be detained under INA sections 236(c) 
(as amended by section 303(a) of this Act) and 241(a) (as 
amended by section 305(a) of this Act), to detain other illegal 
aliens in accordance with the detention priorities of the 
Attorney General, and to detain all inadmissible and deportable 
aliens subject to proceedings under INA sections 235(b) (1) or 
(2), 238, and 240. The report also shall include other 
specified information regarding the release of criminal aliens 
and other illegal aliens into the community.
      Section 387--Senate amendment section 153 recedes to 
House section 112. This subsection requires a pilot program to 
determine the feasibility of using military bases available as 
a result of base closure laws as INS detention centers, and 
specifies that in selecting real property at a military base 
for such purpose, the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense 
consult with the redevelopment authority established for the 
base and give substantial deference to the redevelopment plan 
for the base. This section also requires a report not less than 
30 months after enactment to the Committees on the Judiciary of 
the House of Representatives and the Senate on the feasibility 
of using closed military facilities as INS detention centers.
      Section 388--Section 437 of AEDPA (Public Law 104-132), 
requires the Attorney General to implement within 180 days of 
enactment a program to repatriate aliens who have illegally 
entered the United States not less than 3 times, and who are 
being removed to a country contiguous to the United States, to 
a location not less than 500 kilometers from that country's 
border with the United States. In light of this enactment, the 
pilot programs in House section 111 and Senate amendment 
section 152 are unnecessary. The Senate recedes to House 
section 111(b), requiring a report to the Committees on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives and Senate regarding 
interior repatriation, with modification to refer to the 
mandate in section 437 of AEDPA.

        Title IV--Enforcement of Restrictions Against Employment

   Subtitle A--Pilot Programs for Employment Eligibility Confirmation

      Sections 401 through 405--Senate amendment sections 111-
115 recede to House section 401, with modifications. Subtitle A 
sets up three pilot programs of employment eligibility 
confirmation which will last four years each. These programs 
generally will be operated according to the pilot program 
procedures set out in House section 401. Participation in the 
pilot programs will be voluntary on the part of employers, 
except with regard to the executive and legislative branches of 
the Federal Government and certain employers who have been 
found to be in violation of certain sections of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act. Volunteer employers may have their 
elections apply to all hiring in all State(s) in which a pilot 
program is operating, or to their hiring in only one or more 
pilot program States or places of hiring within any such 
States. The Attorney General may reject elections or limit 
their applicability where the pilot program would have 
insufficient resources available to allow the company to 
participate in the pilot to the extent desired. The Attorney 
General may permit a participating employer to have its 
election apply to hiring in States in which the chosen pilot 
program is not otherwise operating (if the State meets the 
requirements of the pilot program). If an electing employer 
fails to comply with its obligations under a pilot program, 
such as by not complying with the program requirements for all 
new employees covered by its election, the Attorney General may 
terminate the employer's participation in the pilot program. An 
employer may also choose to terminate its participation (in 
such form and manner as the Attorney General may specify). If 
an employer required to participate in a pilot program fails to 
comply, such failure will be treated as a paperwork violation 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act's employment 
verification requirement, and a rebuttable presumption will 
arise that the employer has hired aliens knowing that they are 
unauthorized to work in the United States.
      An employer participating in a pilot program who receives 
confirmation of an employee's identity and employment 
eligibility under the program will benefit from a rebuttable 
presumption that the employer has not hired an alien knowing 
the alien is unauthorized to work. Also, the Attorney General 
shall designate one or more individuals in each INS District 
Office for a Service District in which a pilot program is being 
implemented to assist employers in electing and participating 
in the program, and in more generally complying with INA 
section 274A.
      The first pilot program, the basic pilot program, 
originates in House section 401. Employers in (at a minimum) 
five of the seven States with the highest number of illegal 
aliens may elect to participate. As under current law, the 
employer will have to complete the document review process 
described in INA section 274A(b) (as modified to increase the 
reliability of identification documents). However, if the 
Attorney General determines that an employer participating in 
this (or either of the other two) pilot program(s) can reliably 
determine a new employee's identity and authorization to work 
in the United States relying only on the pilot program 
procedures (discussed below) and a document review process 
including only documents confirming identity, the Attorney 
General can exempt participating employers from having to 
review documents confirming employment authorization.
      Under the basic pilot program, employers would then make 
inquiries (within three days of hire) to the Attorney General 
(or a designee) by means of toll-free telephone line or other 
toll-free electronic media to seek confirmation of the identity 
and employment eligibility of new employees. Employers would be 
given additional time to make inquiries in situations where the 
confirmation system did not receive their initial inquiry, for 
instance because the system's phone lines were overloaded or 
out of operation. While the pilot program could not require 
that participating employers pay any fee to participate, 
employers would be responsible for providing the equipment 
needed to make inquiries. In most cases, this would simply be a 
telephone. However, if an employer wanted to use, for instance, 
a computer and modem to make large numbers of inquiries at 
once, the employer would have to provide such equipment. When 
making an inquiry, an employer would provide a new employee's 
name and social security number (and, if the employee had not 
attested to being a citizen, the employee's INS-issued number).
      Through the confirmation system, this information 
provided in the inquiry will be checked against existing 
Federal Government records in order to provide (or not provide) 
confirmation of identity and work authorization. No new types 
of records will be added to government databases. The 
confirmation system will respond within three days of an 
inquiry--either by providing confirmation of the employee's 
identity and authorization to work or by providing a tentative 
nonconfirmation (in both cases, an appropriate code will be 
provided the employer by the system). After being notified of 
the tentative nonconfirmation, the employee can chose to 
contest or not contest the finding. If the employee does not 
contest the finding, the non-confirmation is considered final. 
If the employee does contest the finding, he or she--within a 
10-day secondary verification period--will communicate with the 
Commissioner of Social Security and/or the Commissioner of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service to resolve those issues 
preventing the confirmation system from confirming the 
employee's identity and work authorization. By the end of the 
secondary verification period, the confirmation system must 
provide either a final confirmation or a final nonconfirmation 
(and appropriate code) to the employer. An employer shall not 
terminate employment of an employee because of a failure to 
have identity and work authorization confirmed under the pilot 
program until a nonconfirmation becomes final. However, the 
employer can terminate the employee for other reasons (as 
consistent with applicable law), such as the failure of the 
employee to show up for work following a tentative 
nonconfirmation.
      An employer, once provided with final nonconfirmation 
with regard to an employee, may either terminate the individual 
or continue his or her employment. If the employer continues to 
employ the individual, the employer must notify the Attorney 
General of this decision. Failure to notify will be deemed to 
be a paperwork violation and will be subject to enhanced 
paperwork violation penalties. Also, if the employer continues 
employment, a rebuttable presumption is created that the 
employer has hired the employee knowing the employee is 
unauthorized to work in the United States. The option of 
continued employment is only intended for the rare circumstance 
where an employer has knowledge independent of the confirmation 
process that the employee is eligible to work in the United 
States--such as knowing the employee since childhood.
       The second pilot program, the citizenship-attestation 
pilot program, originated in Senate amendment section 
112(a)(2)(G). It will operate in at least 5 States or, if 
fewer, all of the States that issue driver's licenses and 
identification cards with enhanced security features and 
procedures. However, employers can only participate in this 
pilot program in the sole discretion of the Attorney General. 
It will operate like the basic pilot program, with one 
important modification. If an employee attests to being a 
citizen, the employer is not required to (1) review documents 
confirming employment authorization when completing the 274A(b) 
document review process, or (2) make an inquiry through the 
confirmation system. This pilot program is designed to make the 
hiring process as easy and pitfall-free as possible for 
citizens and their employers. Its success depends in part on 
the effectiveness of this Act's heightened penalties for 
falsely attesting to U.S. citizenship.
       A variation of the citizen-attestation pilot project 
will be open to election by a maximum of 1,000 employers chosen 
by the Attorney General. Under this program, employers do not 
have to comply with any part of the 274A(b) document review 
process with regard to new employees who attest to being 
citizens. Otherwise, the program is identical in nature to the 
citizen-attestation pilot program.
      The third pilot program, the machine-readable document 
pilot program, originates in Senate section 112(a)(2)(F). It 
will operate as does the basic pilot program, except that if 
the new employee presents a State-issued identification 
document or driver's license that includes a machine-readable 
social security number, the employer will make an inquiry 
through the confirmation system by using a machine-readable 
feature of such document. The employer would have to procure 
the device needed to read the machine-readable document and to 
supply the information needed for the inquiry through the 
machine-readable feature of the document. Since the Social 
Security Administration does not keep up-to-date records of the 
employment eligibility of aliens, those employees who do not 
attest to citizenship will also have to provide their INS-
issued numbers, which the employers will pass on when making 
inquiries through the confirmation system. Employees not 
possessing machine-readable documents will be confirmed as 
under the basic pilot program.
       The machine-readable document pilot program is of course 
limited by the number of States which issue such enhanced 
documents and the fact that even in such States, not all 
individuals will have the machine-readable documents. Thus, it 
will only operate in at least 5 of the States (or, if fewer, 
all of the States) which issue driver's licenses and other 
identification documents with a machine-readable social 
security number (which need not be visible on the card). States 
are encouraged to issue such documents since use of machine-
readable documents makes the confirmation process simpler and 
provides additional assurance that the documents are genuine.
       Employers participating in any of the pilot programs are 
shielded from civil or criminal liability for actions taken in 
good faith reliance on information provided through the 
confirmation system--such as firing a new employee after 
receiving a final nonconfirmation of identity and/or work 
authorization through the confirmation system or continuing to 
employ an employee after receiving final confirmation.
       Nothing in Subtitle A shall be construed to permit the 
Federal Government to utilize any information, data base, or 
other records assembled under the subtitle for any purpose 
other than as provided for under one of the three pilot 
programs. In addition, nothing in the subtitle shall be 
construed to authorize the issuance or use of national 
identification cards or the establishment of a national 
identification card. The confirmation system shall be designed 
and operated to, among other things, maximize its reliability 
and ease of use consistent with insulating and protecting the 
privacy and security of the underlying information, prevent the 
unauthorized disclosure of personal information, and ensure 
that the system not result in unlawful discriminatory practices 
based on national origin or citizenship status. Finally, the 
INS and Social Security Administration shall update their 
information in a manner that promotes maximum accuracy and 
shall provide a process for the prompt correction of erroneous 
information.

       Subtitle B--Other Provisions Relating to Employer Sanctions

       Section 411--Senate recedes to House section 402, with 
modifications. This section provides those employers who in 
good faith make technical or procedural errors in complying 
with INA section 274A(b) an opportunity to correct those errors 
without penalty.
       Section 412(a)--House section 403(a) recedes to Senate 
amendment section 116(b), with modifications. This provision 
reduces the number of documents that can be used to establish 
an individual's employment authorization and/or identity under 
section 274A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. To 
establish both employment authorization and identity, an 
individual may present a (1) a U.S. passport, or (2) a resident 
alien card, alien registration card, or other document 
designated by the Attorney General, all of which must meet 
certain standards (including having certain security features). 
The other documents designated by the Attorney General may 
include an unexpired foreign passport which has an appropriate, 
unexpired endorsement of the Attorney General or an appropriate 
unexpired visa authorizing the individual's employment in the 
United States. To establish employment authorization, an 
individual may present a social security account number card or 
certain other documentation found acceptable by the Attorney 
General. No change has been made from current law as to the 
documents which may be presented to establish identity. 
Finally, the Attorney General may prohibit or place conditions 
on the use of any documents for purposes of section 274A(b) if 
they are found to not reliably establish employment 
authorization or identity or are being used fraudulently to an 
unacceptable degree.
       Section 412(b)--Senate recedes to House section 403(b), 
with modifications. This provision provides a streamlined 
confirmation process under INA section 274A(b) for a new 
employee who is beginning work for a member of an employer 
association that has concluded a collective bargaining 
agreement with an organization representing the employee and 
the employee has within a specified period worked for another 
member of the association who has complied with the 
requirements of section 274A(b) with respect to the employee. 
If these conditions are met, the current employer is deemed to 
have complied with the requirements of section 274A(b) with 
respect to the employee.
       Section 412(c)--Senate recedes to House section 403(c). 
This provision eliminates obsolete provisions of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act.
       Section 412(d)--Senate recedes to House section 403(d). 
This provision clarifies that the Federal government must 
comply with section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act, which makes unlawful the knowing employment of aliens not 
authorized to work in the United States and requires employers 
to confirm the identity and employment authorization of new 
employees.
       Section 413--Senate recedes to House section 404(c)(2). 
This provision requires the Attorney General to submit to 
Congress a report on additional authority or resources needed 
to enforce section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
and the Executive Order of February 13, 1996 (prohibiting 
Federal contractors from knowingly hiring aliens not authorized 
to work in the United States).
       Section 414--Senate recedes to House section 405, with 
modifications. This provision requires the Commissioner of 
Social Security to prepare annual reports regarding social 
security account numbers issued to aliens not authorized to be 
employed, with respect to which, in a fiscal year, earnings 
were reported to the Social Security Administration, and a 
single report on the extent to which social security account 
numbers and cards are used by aliens for fraudulent purposes.
       Section 415--Senate recedes to House section 406. This 
section authorizes the Attorney General to require aliens to 
provide their social security account numbers.
       Section 416--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
120A(a)(1). This section provides that certain immigration 
officers may compel by subpoena the attendance of witnesses and 
the production of documents while conducting investigations of 
potential violations by employers of section 274A(a) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act.

      SUBTITLE C--UNFAIR IMMIGRATION-RELATED EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

      Section 421--House section 407(b) recedes to Senate 
section 117. This provision provides that an employer's request 
of a new employee for more or different documents than are 
required to confirm an employee's identity and authorization to 
work in the United States under INA section 274A(b) or an 
employer's refusal to honor documents that reasonably appear to 
be genuine shall only be considered unfair immigration-related 
employment practices under INA section 274B(a)(1) if made for 
the purpose or with the intent of unlawfully discriminating 
against the employee on the basis of citizenship status or 
national origin.

              Title V--Restrictions on Benefits for Aliens

      Section 500--Senate recedes to House section 600 with 
modifications to divide this section into two parts: subsection 
(a), setting forth a series of statements of congressional 
policy regarding aliens and public benefits; and subsection 
(b), stating the sense of Congress that: (1) courts should 
apply the same standard of review to States choosing to 
restrict their public benefits programs pursuant to the 
authorizations contained in this Act as the court uses in 
determining whether an Act of Congress regulating the 
eligibility of aliens for public benefits is constitutional; 
and (2) if a court applies the strict scrutiny standard of 
constitutional review, the court shall consider the State law 
to be the least restrictive means available for achieving the 
compelling government interest of assuring that aliens be self-
reliant in accordance with national immigration policy. The 
purpose of the congressional grants of authority to States 
regarding eligibility for public benefits contained in this Act 
is to encourage States to implement the national immigration 
policy of assuring that aliens be self-reliant and not become 
public charges--a fundamental part of U.S. immigration policy 
since 1882.

SUBTITLE A--ELIGIBILITY OF EXCLUDABLE, DEPORTABLE, NONIMMIGRANT ALIENS 
                   FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND BENEFITS

      Sections 501 and 502--House section 601 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 201(a)(1) with modifications. These sections 
bar ineligible aliens (as defined herein) from Federal, State, 
and local public benefits programs, contracts, grants, loans, 
and licenses, with specified exemptions (as defined herein).
      In general, ineligible aliens should not take advantage 
of taxpayers by accessing public benefits. However, the 
managers believe that certain public health, nutrition, and in-
kind community service programs should be exempted from the 
general prohibition on ineligible aliens accessing public 
benefits. The exemption for public health assistance for 
immunizations is not intended to be limited to immunizations 
under the Public Health Service Act, but refers to all 
immunizations. In the subparagraph treating certain battered 
aliens (or certain aliens subjected to extreme cruelty) as 
eligible aliens, the managers believe that the phrase ``an 
alien whose child has been battered or subjected to extreme 
cruelty'' includes children who have been sexually molested.
      The managers intend that the inclusion of parolees who 
are paroled into the United States for a period of at least one 
year in the definition of eligible alien refers only to the 
period for which such aliens are authorized to remain in the 
United States after their parole. The statement contained in 
the Committee Report accompanying the Senate Amendment, that 
such reference referred to parolees who had been present in the 
United States for one year or more, does not reflect the 
intention of the managers as stated herein.
      In defining ``means-tested public benefit,'' (for 
purposes of sections 501, 551, 552), the managers do not intend 
to include programs which do not consider an applicant's income 
in the disbursement of assistance. For example, Title I grants 
under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 are 
provided to school districts with significant numbers of needy 
students. Since all students in that district will receive 
assistance from these funds--regardless of each student's 
financial status--neither ``deeming'' (see section 552) nor the 
prohibition on receipt by illegal aliens are applicable. ESEA 
is exempted under sections 551 and 552 only because certain 
means-tested benefits (such as Elleander Fellowships) are 
authorized under that Act as well.
      Many States use Federal block grant monies to provide 
services to the poor which are not within the scope of what the 
managers consider ``means-tested.'' For example, soup kitchens 
and homeless shelters serve needy individuals, but the 
operators do not require each applicant to demonstrate 
financial need. Similarly, if a State chose to use money from 
the Social Service Block Grant to fund the administrative costs 
of a youth soccer league in a poor area of that State, such a 
benefit would not be considered ``means-tested'' under this 
Act.
      The exception for treatment of communicable diseases is 
very narrow. The managers intend that it only apply where 
absolutely necessary to prevent the spread of such diseases. 
The managers do not intend that the exception for testing and 
treatment for communicable diseases should include treatment 
for the HIV virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. This 
exception is only intended to cover short-term measures that 
would be taken prior to the departure of the alien from the 
United States. It does not provide authority for long-term 
treatment of such diseases or a means for illegal aliens to 
delay their removal from the country.
      The allowance for emergency medical services also is very 
narrow. The managers intend that it only apply to medical care 
that is strictly of an emergency nature, such as medical 
treatment for emergency treatment administered in an emergency 
room, critical care unit, or intensive care unit. Emergency 
medical services do not include pre-natal or delivery care, or 
post-partum assistance, that is not strictly of an emergency 
nature as specified herein--including State-funded or 
administered pre-natal and post-partum care. The managers 
intend that any provision of services under this exception for 
mental health disorders be limited to circumstances in which 
the alien's condition is such that he is a danger to himself or 
to others and has therefore been judged incompetent by a court 
of appropriate jurisdiction.
      Section 503--House section 602 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 201(b) with modifications to eliminate the 
crediting of employment for purposes of unemployment benefits 
for individuals in PRUCOL status.
      Section 504--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
201(c) with modifications. This section amends section 202 of 
the Social Security Act to provide that no Social Security 
benefits may be paid to an alien not lawfully present in the 
United States. This section also amends section 210 of the 
Social Security Act to provide that periods of unauthorized 
employment shall not count towards an alien's eligibility for 
Social Security retirement benefits. The managers intend to 
allow sufficient time for the Social Security Administration to 
comply with this provision in order for SSA field offices to 
develop appropriate screening procedures.
      Section 505--Senate recedes to House section 601(c) with 
modifications to amend the SAVE program. This section requires 
proof of identity for all applicants in addition to the 
verification requirements for non-citizens under section 
1137(d) of the Social Security Act.
      Section 506--Senate recedes to House section 601(d). This 
section authorizes State and local governments to require proof 
of eligibility (including identity) from applicants for State 
and local public benefits programs.
      Section 507--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
201(a)(2) with modifications. This section provides that 
illegal aliens are not eligible for in-state tuition rates at 
public institutions of higher education.
      Section 508--Senate recedes to House section 606. House 
recedes to Senate amendment section 205. This section requires 
that applicants for post-secondary financial assistance be 
subject to verification of their eligibility prior to receiving 
such assistance. The managers believe that House section 606 
reflects the current practice of the Department of Education 
regarding the verification of student eligibility for 
postsecondary financial assistance.
      Section 509--House recedes to Senate amendment sections 
324 and 326. These sections amend the Social Security Act, and 
the Higher Education Act of 1986 to require the submission of 
photostatic or similar copies of documents or information 
specified by the INS for verification of an alien's immigration 
status.
      Section 510--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
201(e) with modifications. This section requires Federal, 
State, and local public benefits agencies to verify an 
applicant's eligibility (including the amount of eligibility) 
prior to the administration of public benefits by a non-profit 
charitable organization. The managers believe that non-profit 
charitable organizations themselves should not have to verify 
immigration status or determine the eligibility of aliens for 
public benefits, e.g., by ``deeming'' the income of sponsors to 
immigrant applicants for assistance (see section 552). The 
managers also believe, however, that the appropriate Federal or 
State agency must verify and determine the amount of 
eligibility of aliens for public benefits before a non-profit 
charitable organization may distribute means-tested benefits to 
such aliens.
      Section 511--Senate recedes to House section 607, with 
modifications. This section requires the Comptroller General to 
submit a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House 
of Representatives and the Senate regarding the receipt of 
means-tested public benefits by ineligible aliens on behalf of 
U.S. citizens and eligible aliens. The managers note that 
illegal aliens often access public benefits, such as AFDC and 
Food Stamps, for which they themselves are ineligible, by 
applying for such benefits on behalf of their U.S. citizen or 
legal immigrant children.

Subtitle B--Expansion of Disqualification From Immigration Benefits on 
                       the Basis of Public Charge

      Section 531--Senate recedes to House section 621 with 
modifications. This section amends INA section 212(a)(4) to 
expand the public charge ground of inadmissibility. Aliens have 
been excludable if likely to become public charges since 1882. 
Self-reliance is one of the most fundamental principles of 
immigration law. The managers believe that all family-sponsored 
immigrants, and certain employment-based immigrants, should 
have affidavits of support executed on their behalf as a 
condition of admission.
      Section 532--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
202 with modifications. This section amends INA section 
241(a)(5) to expand the public charge ground of deportation. 
Aliens who access welfare have been deportable as public 
charges since 1917. However, only a negligible number of aliens 
who become public charges have been deported in the last 
decade. The managers believe that aliens who become public 
charges within 7 years of their admission to the United States 
should promptly be removed from the country. Just as with the 
definition of ``eligible alien'' in section 501, the exception 
in section 532 for battered children includes children who are 
victims of sexual molestation.

      Subtitle C--Affidavits of Support and Attribution of Income

      Section 551--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
203 with modifications. This section creates a new, legally-
binding affidavit of support in order to seek reimbursement 
from sponsors for the costs of providing public benefits. The 
managers intend that the affidavit of support be a legally-
binding contract between an alien's sponsor, the sponsored 
alien, and the government. The managers also intend that public 
hospitals, private hospitals, and community health centers be 
allowed to seek reimbursement from sponsors for the costs of 
providing emergency medical services to the extent such 
services would, in the absence of the deeming requirements of 
section 552, be reimbursed by means-tested public benefit 
programs. The managers further intend that the new, legally 
enforceable, affidavit of support be used in all cases where an 
affidavit of support is required (including for nonimmigrants 
and aliens granted parole under section 212(d)(5) of the INA), 
either by statute, regulation, or administrative practice. 
Exceptions to the definition of ``means-tested public benefit'' 
include public health assistance for immunizations and, if the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that it is 
necessary to prevent the spread of a serious communicable 
disease, for testing and treatment of such disease. However, 
the exception applies in the case of HIV infection to testing 
only.
      The provision is designed to encourage immigrants to be 
self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy. 
The managers intend to establish a process that will authorize 
visas only for those applicants whose sponsors (both the 
petitioning sponsor as defined in subsection (g)(1), (g)(2), 
(g)(3), or (g)(4)) and any non-petitioning sponsor as defined 
in subsection (g)(5) demonstrate the means to meet the 
applicable income requirements (as set forth in subsection 
(g)). It is expected that an applicant whose sponsors fail to 
demonstrate the means to meet the applicable income 
requirements will be denied a visa, and that the next applicant 
in the queue will then be given an opportunity to qualify. The 
managers further intend that an applicant whose petitioning 
sponsor or non-petitioning sponsor (or both) is unable to meet 
the applicable income requirements in the initial interview may 
be afforded one additional opportunity to meet such 
requirements. If such applicant has already utilized a non-
petitioning sponsor at the initial interview, and such non-
petitioning sponsor was unable to meet the applicable income 
requirements, such applicant may be provided one additional 
opportunity to demonstrate that the non-petitioning sponsor 
meets the applicable income requirements, but may not be 
authorized in the second interview to substitute a new or 
different non-petitioning sponsor. The managers intend that 
applicants shall have no more than two opportunities to 
demonstrate that their sponsor (or sponsors) meets the 
applicable income requirements.
      Section 552--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
204 with modifications. This section deems that a sponsor's 
income is to be counted with a sponsored alien's in determining 
the alien's eligibility for public benefits. In subsection 
(c)(4), the managers intend for the Attorney General to enter 
information regarding the eligibility (including the amount of 
eligibility) of aliens for public benefits into the SAVE system 
as a means for all public benefits agencies to access such 
information for purposes of determining eligibility and seeking 
reimbursement. In subsection (d)(1), the managers believe that 
the scope of the exception to deeming in cases of indigence is 
very narrow, and only applies to situations where a sponsor and 
the sponsor's spouse cannot or will not provide needed support, 
and the sponsored alien could not obtain food or shelter 
without assistance from a public benefits agency. In 
determining whether a sponsored alien could obtain food or 
shelter in such a situation, the agency making the 
determination shall take into account whether the sponsored 
alien could obtain assistance for food or shelter from a 
privately-funded organization, and if so, shall refer the alien 
to such organization in lieu of providing benefits. The agency 
must notify the Attorney General when exercising this 
exception.
      Under current law, all three programs which ``deem'' 
sponsor income exclude a portion of the sponsor's income in 
their calculations. This legislation rejects this approach. At 
entry, a sponsor and the sponsored alien are considered to be 
part of one family unit (living under the same roof), and all 
of the sponsor's income is considered to be available--just as 
would be available to the sponsor's spouse or child. The same 
approach should be used at adjudication for benefits. All of 
the income of the sponsor and the sponsor's spouse should be 
deemed to be available to the sponsored alien, as though the 
sponsored alien is a member of the same family unit (and lives 
under the same roof) as the sponsor.
      Subsection (d) provides that the deeming rules shall not 
apply to Medicaid assistance used for emergency medical 
services. Under subsection 552(f), just as in the case of the 
definition of ``eligible alien'' in section 501, the exception 
to deeming rules for battered children includes children who 
are victims of sexual molestation.
      Section 553--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
204(e). This section authorizes State and local government to 
follow the Federal Government in deeming a sponsor's income to 
a sponsored alien who applies for public benefits. The managers 
intend to authorize States to enact sponsor-to-alien deeming 
laws as part of the national immigration policy that aliens be 
self-reliant. If a State deeming law, enacted pursuant to the 
authorization contained in this section, should be challenged 
in court, the managers intend that the court shall apply the 
standard of review described in section 500(b)(1) of this Act.
      Section 554--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
206. This section authorizes State and local governments to 
enact alienage restrictions in State and local cash public 
assistance programs. The managers intend to authorize States to 
prohibit or otherwise limit eligibility of aliens for general 
cash assistance as part of the national immigration policy that 
aliens be self-reliant, but only to the extent that such limit 
is not more restrictive than under comparable Federal programs. 
If a State restriction, enacted pursuant to the authorization 
contained in this section, should be challenged in court, the 
managers intend that the court shall apply the standard of 
review contained in section 500(b)(1) of this Act.

                  Subtitle D--Miscellaneous Provisions

      Section 561--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
207 with modifications. This provision increases the maximum 
criminal penalties for forging or counterfeiting a Federal seal 
or facilitating the fraudulent obtaining of public benefits by 
aliens.
      Section 562--Senate recedes to House section 812, with 
modification. This section amends INA section 412(c)(2) to 
specify that in the computation of targeted refugee 
resettlement assistance, each county shall receive the same 
amount of assistance for each refugee and entrant residing in 
the county at the beginning of each fiscal year (counting those 
refugees and entrants who arrived within 60 months prior to 
that fiscal year).
      Section 563--Senate recedes to House section 604 with 
modifications. This provision allows public hospitals to seek 
reimbursement for costs incurred from providing emergency 
medical services to illegal aliens if the immigration status of 
individuals for whom reimbursement is sought has been verified, 
but is not intended to create an entitlement for such 
reimbursement.
      Section 564--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
211 with modifications. This provision allows States to be 
reimbursed for emergency ambulance service costs provided to 
certain illegal aliens who are injured while attempting to 
enter the U.S., but is not intended to create an entitlement 
for such reimbursement.
      Section 565--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
315 with modifications. This section establishes a pilot 
program to require bonds in addition to sponsorship and deeming 
requirements for the purposes of overcoming excludability as a 
public charge under INA section 212(a)(4). The managers believe 
that where bonds are used to overcome the grounds for exclusion 
as a public charge, whether in this pilot program or in current 
INA section 213, the bonds should be required in addition to, 
not in lieu of, the new sponsorship and deeming requirements 
created in this Act.
      Section 566--The managers agree to require a series of 
reports by the Attorney General regarding the affidavit of 
support, attribution of sponsor income, public charge 
deportation, and non-profit charitable organization exemption 
provisions of this Act.

                     Subtitle E--Housing Assistance

      Section 571--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
221. This section provides a short title for the provisions 
contained in this subtitle.
      Section 572--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
222 with modifications. This section prorates public housing 
assistance based upon the number of eligible recipients within 
a family unit.
      Section 573--House section 611 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 223 with modifications. This provision limits 
any deferrals of termination decisions to a single 3-month 
period.
      Section 574--House section 612 recedes to Senate 
amendment sections 224 and 325 with modifications. This 
provision ensures that aliens are not allowed to receive public 
housing assistance until their eligibility has been verified. 
Aliens may not begin receiving such assistance while their 
applications are pending.
      Section 575--House section 613 recedes to section 225 of 
the Senate amendment. This section prohibits sanctions against 
entities that make erroneous determinations of eligibility for 
housing assistance.
      Section 576--House section 614 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 227 with modifications. This provision 
establishes regulations for carrying out the sections of this 
subtitle.
      Section 577--House section 605 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 201(d). This provision requires a report 
describing the manner in which the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development is enforcing section 214 of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1980, which prevents illegal 
aliens from receiving public housing assistance.

                     Subtitle F--General Provisions

      Section 591--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
231(a). This section provides that unless otherwise specified, 
the provisions of this title take effect on the date of 
enactment.
      Section 592--Senate recedes to House section 634. This 
section clarifies that the provisions of this title do not set 
forth all requirements of eligibility for public assistance, or 
determine when such requirements are satisfied, but only relate 
to the general issue of eligibility or ineligibility on the 
basis of alienage.
      Section 593--The managers agree to include a provision 
clarifying that Title V does not apply to programs of foreign 
assistance.
      Section 594--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
201(a)(3) with modifications to allow either individual or 
public notice of changes in eligibility for benefits recipients 
caused by this Act.
      Section 595--This section provides that, for purposes of 
this title, the definitions of ``alien,'' ``State,'' ``United 
States,'' ``national,'' ``naturalization,'' and ``child'' are 
the same definitions as set forth in the INA.
      The managers acknowledge that some of the provisions 
contained in this Title differ from similar provisions enacted 
this year as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193). To 
the extent possible, the managers intend to reconcile these 
differing provisions during the next Congress to avoid 
confusion in the implementation of these policies.

                   Title VI--Miscellaneous Provisions

                Subtitle A--Refugees, Parole, and Asylum

      Section 601--Senate recedes to House section 501. 
Subsection (a) amends the definition of refugee at section 
101(a)(42) to provide that a person who has been forced to 
abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or 
who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such 
a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population 
control program shall be deemed to have been persecuted on 
account of political opinion, and a person who has a well 
founded fear of being compelled to undergo such a procedure or 
being subject to such persecution shall be deemed to have a 
well founded fear of persecution on account of political 
opinion.
      Subsection (b) amends section 207(a) to provide that not 
more than 1,000 refugees shall be admitted on the basis of 
persecution under coercive population control policies.
      Section 602--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
191 with modifications. This section amends INA section 
212(d)(5) to provide that the Attorney General's parole 
authority may be exercised only on a case-by-case basis for 
urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. This 
section also requires that not later than 90 days after the end 
of the fiscal year, the Attorney General shall report to the 
Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate describing the number and categories of aliens 
paroled into the United States under section 212(d)(5), along 
with other specified information.
      Section 603--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
192 with modifications. This section amends INA section 201(c) 
to provide, beginning in 1999, that aliens paroled into the 
United States in the second previous fiscal year who do not 
depart within 365 days and who have not yet become permanent 
resident aliens (or who, if they did become LPRs, did so under 
a provision of law other than 201(b) that did not count toward 
the worldwide level), will be counted towards the worldwide 
level of family-sponsored immigrants. If an alien is counted 
towards the worldwide level under this provision and 
subsequently adjusts to LPR status, the alien shall not be so 
counted again at the time of adjustment.
      Section 604--Senate recedes to House section 511, with 
modifications. This section amends section 208 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act to provide that an alien who is 
physically present in, or who arrives in, the United States may 
apply for asylum in accordance with section 208 or, where 
applicable, section 235(b)(1). However, an alien may not apply 
for asylum if the Attorney General determines that the alien 
can be returned to a safe third country pursuant to a bilateral 
agreement, unless the Attorney General finds that it is in the 
public interest for the alien to receive asylum in the United 
States. An applicant for asylum must demonstrate by clear and 
convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 
1 year of arriving in the United States (unless the alien can 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that 
extraordinary circumstances caused the delay in filing an 
application prior to the deadline), and an alien is not 
eligible to apply for asylum if the alien has previously 
applied for and been denied asylum; these bars do not apply if 
the alien demonstrates the existence of changed circumstances 
which materially affect the applicant's eligibility for asylum. 
A determination by the Attorney General that an alien is 
ineligible to apply for asylum is not subject to judicial 
review.
      Subsection (b) adopts the conditions for granting asylum 
outlined in House section 511(a). Subsection (c) clarifies the 
status of an alien granted asylum. It also provides that asylum 
may be terminated if the alien: is no longer a refugee under 
section 101(a)(42); is ineligible for asylum under subsection 
(b); may be returned to a safe third country; has voluntarily 
returned to his country of nationality or last habitual 
residence with lawful permanent resident or equivalent status; 
or has acquired a new nationality which confers protection on 
the alien. An alien whose asylum is terminated is subject to 
any applicable ground of inadmissibility or deportation.
      Subsection (d) provides for the establishment of 
procedures for considering applications for asylum. The 
applicant may be required to submit fingerprints and a 
photograph. The House provisions regarding employment 
authorization, application fees, legal representation, and 
notice of the consequences of knowingly filing a frivolous 
application for asylum are included, as are the House 
provisions on consideration of asylum applications. If the 
Attorney General determines that an alien has knowingly made a 
frivolous application for asylum and the alien has received 
notice, the alien shall be permanently ineligible for any 
benefits under the INA. Nothing in subsection (d) shall be 
construed to create any substantive or procedural right or 
benefit that is enforceable by any party against the United 
States.
      Subsection (b) makes conforming and clerical amendments. 
Subsection (c) provides that the amendments made by this 
section shall take effect on the first day of the first month 
beginning more than 180 days after the date of enactment.
      Section 605--Senate recedes to House section 513. This 
section authorizes an increase in the number of asylum officers 
by at least 600 in FY 1997.
      Section 606--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
196. This section provides for the conditional repeal of the 
Cuban Adjustment Act upon the establishment of democracy in 
Cuba.

Subtitle B--Miscellaneous Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality 
                                  Act

      Section 621--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
185. This section amends INA section 214(j)(1) to double the 
number of ``S'' visas (pertaining to alien witness cooperators) 
that may be issued in a given fiscal year.
      Section 622--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
310. This section extends the period for waiver of the foreign 
country residence requirement for foreign medical graduates to 
June 1, 2002, and amends INA sections 212(e) and 214(k) to 
place additional conditions and restrictions on waivers 
requested by a United States Government or State agency. These 
additional restrictions are imposed, among other things, to 
ensure that aliens granted such waivers remain employed in 
positions deemed to be in the public interest.
      Section 623--House section 809 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 175, with modifications. This section amends 
INA sections 245A(c)(5) and 210(b)(6)(C) to require the 
Attorney General to disclose information in an application for 
legalization to a law enforcement entity, upon written request, 
in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution, or 
to a coroner in order to identify a deceased individual.
      Section 624--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
311. This section amends section 212(a)(5) to provide that in 
the case of certain professional athletes, a labor 
certification shall remain valid if the athlete is traded by 
his original sponsoring employer to another team in the same 
sport.
      Section 625--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
214(a), with modifications. This section amends INA section 214 
to provide that an alien may not be given or validly remain in 
nonimmigrant status under INA section 101(a)(15)(F) if the 
alien is pursuing studies at a public elementary school or 
publicly-funded adult education program. The section also 
provides that an alien may not have such status at a public 
secondary school unless the period of such status does not 
exceed 12 months and the alien has paid reimbursement equal to 
the full unsubsidized per capita student cost. This amendment 
also provides that an alien who obtains an ``F-1'' visa to 
pursue studies at a private elementary or secondary school, or 
privately-funded language program, shall be considered to have 
violated the conditions of the visa if the alien terminates or 
abandons such studies and undertakes studies at a public school 
or publicly-funded adult education or language training 
program.
      Section 626--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
328. This section adds a new INA section 294 to permit the 
Attorney General to expend appropriated funds to pay for the 
transportation of the remains of any INS officer or Border 
Patrol agent killed in the line of duty to a place of burial in 
the United States, Puerto Rico, or U.S. territories or 
possessions, as well as other related and incidental costs.

    Subtitle C--Provisions Relating to Visa Processing and Consular 
                               Efficiency

      Section 631--Senate recedes to House section 807. This 
section amends INA section 221(c) to provide that an immigrant 
visa shall be valid for a period of six months, and to provide 
that the period for validity of a nonimmigrant visa issued to 
an alien of one nationality who has been granted refugee status 
and been firmly resettled in another country shall be based on 
the treatment granted by the country of resettlement to alien 
refugees resettled in the U.S.
      Section 632--House section 803(b) recedes to Senate 
amendment section 157. This section amends INA section 222 by 
adding a new subsection (g), providing that an alien who has 
remained in the United States beyond the authorized period of 
stay may not be readmitted to the United States on that 
nonimmigrant visa, and may only be readmitted as a nonimmigrant 
on the basis of a visa issued in a consular office located in 
the country of the alien's nationality (or, if there is no such 
office, at a consular office designated by the Secretary of 
State), or where extraordinary circumstances are found by the 
Secretary of State.
      Section 633--House section 803(a) recedes to Senate 
amendment section 172. This section amends INA section 
202(a)(1) to clarify that the Secretary of State has non-
reviewable authority to establish procedures for the processing 
of immigrant visa applications and the locations where visas 
will be processed.
      Section 634--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
301, with modifications. This section amends INA sections 222 
(c) and (e) to make certain changes in the visa application 
process.
      Section 635--House section 836 recedes to Senate 
amendment section 302. This section amends INA section 217(f) 
to extend the authorization for the Visa Waiver Pilot Program 
(VWPP) through September 30, 1997. This section also repeals 
current section 217(g) (regarding the probationary program), 
and adds a new section 217(g) to specify procedures for 
termination of a country's designation to participate in the 
VWPP. A country with a disqualification rate of between 2 and 
3.5 percent shall be placed on probationary status for a period 
of not more than 3 years. (The disqualification rate is the 
percentage that the number of aliens from the country who were 
found inadmissible, withdrew their applications for admission, 
or were admitted as nonimmigrants and violated the terms of 
their admission in a given fiscal year, represents of the total 
number of nationals of that country who applied for admission 
as nonimmigrant visitors during the same fiscal year.) A 
country with a disqualification rate of greater than 3.5 
percent shall be terminated from the VWPP at the beginning of 
the second fiscal year after this determination is made. If a 
country on probationary status by the end of the designated 
period fails to develop a machine-readable passport program or 
has a disqualification rate of greater than 2 percent, the 
country shall be terminated from the VWPP at the beginning of 
the first fiscal year after such determination is made. The 
Attorney General and Secretary of State retain the discretion 
to terminate any country's designation as a participant in the 
VWPP, or to deny a waiver to any individual from a country 
which is a participant.
      Section 636--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
306, with modifications. This section provides that the 
Secretary of State may establish a fee for diversity immigrant 
visas to be paid by each applicant for such a visa. The fee may 
be set to recover the cost of administering the diversity visa 
program, including the cost of processing all applications for 
diversity visas. It is intended that this fee would be paid by 
all entrants into the ``lottery'' for eligibility for a 
diversity visa.
      Section 637--Senate recedes to House section 841, with 
modifications. This section provides that certain aliens 
selected as diversity immigrants during FY 1995, and whose 
applications for adjustment of status under INA section 245 
were accepted by the Attorney General, shall be selected for 
diversity immigrant visas in FY 1997 and given priority over 
other aliens selected for such visas. The number of Polish 
nationals notified in FY 1995 that they were eligible for a 
diversity immigrant visa exceeded the number of visas that were 
available. The purpose of this provision is to place these 
individuals in the same position they would have been in FY 
1995 had sufficient visas been available.

                      Subtitle D--Other Provisions

      Section 641--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
215, with modifications. This section requires the Attorney 
General, in cooperation with the Secretaries of State and 
Education, to collect from colleges and universities certain 
information regarding nonimmigrant foreign students from 
designated countries who are enrolled at such institutions 
pursuant to visas under INA section 101(a)(15) (F), (J), or 
(M). The information shall include the alien's identity, 
current address, nonimmigrant classification, academic 
standing, and disciplinary action, if any. Institutions shall 
participate as a condition of their approval for participation 
in exchange student visa programs, and the collection of data 
shall be funded by a fee charged on all visas issued under 
section 101(a)(15) (F), (J), or (M).
      Section 642--Senate amendment section 177 recedes to 
House section 833, with modifications. This section provides 
that notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or 
local law, no State or local government entity shall prohibit 
or in any way restrict any government entity or official from 
sending to or receiving from the INS information regarding the 
immigration status of any individual in the United States.
      Section 643--Senate recedes to House section 834. This 
section requires the Attorney General, not later than 6 months 
after the date of enactment, to issue regulations regarding the 
rights of ``habitual residence'' under the Compacts of Free 
Association between the United States and the governments of 
the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia, 
and between the United States and Palau.
      Section 644--Senate recedes to House section 835. This 
section requires aliens from certain countries specified by the 
INS in consultation with the Secretary of State to be advised 
prior to or at the time of entry into the United States of the 
severe harm caused by female genital mutilation and the 
potential legal consequences in the United States of performing 
female genital mutilation or of allowing a child to be 
subjected to female genital mutilation.
      Section 645--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
335. This section amends chapter 7 of title 18 to add a new 
section 116, prohibiting the practice of female genital 
mutilation on any individual less than 18 years old, and 
setting penalties of up to 5 years imprisonment.
      Section 646--Senate recedes to House section 837. This 
section will permit the adjustment of status of certain 
nationals of Poland and Hungary who were paroled into the 
United States between November 1, 1989, and December 31, 1991, 
after having been denied refugee status.
      Section 647--Senate amendment section 307 recedes to 
House section 838. This section requires the Attorney General 
to make available funds up to $5,000 for demonstration projects 
in support of naturalization ceremonies to be conducted in 
fiscal years 1997 through 2001.
      Section 648--Senate recedes to House section 842. This 
section states the sense of Congress that, to the extent 
practicable, all equipment and products purchased with funds 
authorized by this Act shall be American-made, and that 
recipients of grants under this Act receive notice of this 
statement of Congress.
      Section 649--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
171(b). This section amends 50 U.S.C. 191 to extend the 
authority of the Attorney General to direct the movement of 
vessels in emergencies to include situations of actual or 
anticipated mass migrations of aliens arriving by sea.
      Section 650--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
308. This section requires the Attorney General to investigate 
and submit a report to Congress regarding the practices of 
entities authorized by regulation to administer the English and 
civics tests to applicants for naturalization. A preliminary 
report shall be submitted within 90 days of enactment, and a 
final report shall be issued within 275 days after submission 
of the preliminary report.
      Section 651--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
309. This section provides that the United States Customs 
Administrative Building at the Ysleta/Zaragosa Port of Entry in 
El Paso shall be known as the ``Timothy C. McCaghren Customs 
Administrative Building.''
      Section 652--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
312. This section addresses abuses in the practices of certain 
international matchmaking organizations (``mail order bride 
businesses'') by requiring such organizations, under pain of 
civil penalty, to provide certain immigration information to 
potential recruits for immigration to the United States, and by 
requiring the Attorney General to conduct a study and submit a 
report to Congress regarding the number of mail order 
marriages, the extent of marriage fraud arising as a result of 
such marriages, the extent of domestic abuse in such marriages, 
and the need for expanded regulation to implement the policies 
of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 in this area.
      Section 653--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
321. This section requires the Comptroller General to review 
the effectiveness of the H-2A nonimmigrant program to ensure 
that the program provides a workable safety valve in the event 
of future shortages of domestic agricultural workers. The 
report shall be submitted not later than December 31, 1996, or 
3 months after the date of enactment, whichever is sooner.
      Section 654--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
333. This section requires the Commissioner of the Customs 
Service to initiate a study of allegations of harassment by 
Canadian Customs agents designed to deter cross-border 
commercial activity along the United States-New Brunswick 
border. The study shall include a review of the connection 
between such incidents of harassment and the imposition of the 
New Brunswick Provincial Sales Tax on goods purchased in the 
United States by New Brunswick residents. The Commissioner 
shall consult with State and local officials in Maine in 
conducting this study, and shall submit a report to Congress on 
results of the study within 120 days of enactment of this Act.
      Section 655--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
334. This section states the sense of Congress that the 
collection by Canadian Customs officials of a New Brunswick 
Provincial Sales Tax on goods purchased in the United States by 
residents of New Brunswick, but not on goods purchased by New 
Brunswick residents in other Canadian provinces, may violate 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and that the 
United States Trade Representative should move without delay in 
seeking redress under the dispute resolution process in chapter 
20 of NAFTA.
      Section 656--House sections 831 and 832 recede to Senate 
amendment section 118, with modifications. Without placing 
mandates on states, this section establishes grant programs to 
encourage states to develop more counterfeit-resistant birth 
certificates and driver's licenses. After October 1, 2000, 
Federal agencies may only accept as proof of identity driver's 
licenses that conform to standards developed by the Secretary 
of the Treasury after consultation with state motor vehicle 
officials through the American Association of Motor Vehicle 
Administrators. Beginning 4 years after the date of enactment, 
Federal agencies may only accept birth certificates issued 
after such date that conform to standards developed by the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services after consultation with 
appropriate State officials. The managers intend that the new 
standards developed in consultation with state officials apply 
only to licenses issued or renewed after October 1, 2000, and 
only to birth certificates issued more than 4 years after the 
date of enactment.
      Section 657--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
332, with modifications. This section requires the Commissioner 
of Social Security to develop a prototype of a counterfeit-
resistant social security card, and requires the Comptroller 
General to conduct a study and issue a report to Congress that 
examines different methods of improving the social security 
card application process.
      Section 658--House recedes to Senate amendment section 
314. This section will authorize the transfer of INA artifacts 
to the Border Patrol Museum and Memorial Library Foundation.
      Section 659--Senate recedes to House section 840. This 
section states the sense of Congress regarding enforcement 
priorities of the INS.

                   Subtitle E--Technical Corrections.

      Section 671--Senate recedes to House section 851, with 
modifications. This section makes a number of entirely 
technical corrections to the Immigration Reform and Control Act 
of 1986, the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections 
Act of 1994, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and other 
legislation.

                            Other Provisions

      The House recedes to the Senate on the following 
provisions: House sections 222, 300, 801.
      The Senate recedes to the House on the following 
provisions: Senate amendment sections 120B, 120D, 120E, 305, 
318.
