                          Purpose and Summary

    H.R. 3633 amends Title XVIII and Title XIX of the Social 
Security Act to permit a waiver of the prohibition of offering 
nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs in 
certain facilities. This measure permits a State to waive the 
current prohibition if the State: (1) determines that there is 
no other such program offered within a reasonable distance of 
the facility; (2) assures, through an oversight effort, that an 
adequate environment exists for operating the program in the 
facility; and (3) provides notice of such determination to the 
State long-term care ombudsman.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

    Under existing Federal law, a nursing facility may lose its 
ability to offer facility-based nurse aide training and 
competency evaluation programs for reasons that are unrelated 
to the quality of the program itself. This unintended 
consequence of current law arises from instances where some 
form of operational deficiency may exist, even though such 
deficiency is unrelated to the nurse aide training and 
evaluation programs and is being or has been corrected. As a 
result, nursing facilities, particularly those in rural 
communities, are prevented from conducting the training and 
evaluation that is integral to the provision of quality nursing 
care and the prevention of a staffing void.
    This measure would revise current law to permit the 
continuation of nurse aide training and competency evaluation 
programs in affected facilities under certain circumstances. In 
order for a facility to continue its training and evaluation 
programs, the State in which it is located would have to make a 
determination that no similar program is in existence within a 
reasonable distance of the facility, conduct oversight 
activities to ensure that an adequate environment exists for 
operating the program in the facility, and provide notice of 
such determination to the State long-term care ombudsman. The 
Committee and the Administration agree that these training 
programs should continue under certain circumstances.

                                Hearings

    The Committee on Commerce has not held hearings on the 
legislation.

                        Committee Consideration

    On September 18, 1996, the Committee on Commerce met in 
open markup session and ordered H.R. 3633, a bill to amend 
Titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to permit a 
waiver of the prohibition of offering nurse aide training and 
competency evaluation programs in certain nursing facilities, 
reported to the House, without amendment, by a voice vote, a 
quorum being present.

                             Rollcall Votes

    Clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI of the Rules of the House 
requires the Committee to list the recorded votes on the motion 
to report legislation and on amendments thereto. There were no 
recorded votes taken in connection with ordering H.R. 3633 
reported. A motion by Mr. Bliley to order H.R. 3633 reported to 
the House, without amendment, was agreed to by a voice vote, a 
quorum being present.

                      Committee Oversight Findings

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the Committee has not held 
oversight or legislative hearings on this legislation.

              Committee on Government Reform and Oversight

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(D) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, no oversight findings have been 
submitted to the Committee by the Committee on Government 
Reform and Oversight.

               New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(B) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee states 
that H.R 3633 would result in no new or increased budget 
authority or tax expenditures or revenues.

                        Committee Cost Estimate

    The Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate prepared 
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                  Congressional Budget Office Estimate

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the following is the cost 
estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant 
to section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 18, 1996.
Hon. Thomas J. Bliley,
Chairman, Committee on Commerce,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 3633, a bill to permit a waiver of the 
prohibition of offering nurse aide training and competency 
evaluation programs in certain nursing facilities, as ordered 
reported on September 18, 1996. Pay-as-you-go procedures would 
apply because the bill could affect direct spending.
    The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 included a 
number of provisions that required nursing facilities to 
conduct nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs. 
However, the Secretary could not approve such programs at 
nursing facilities under certain conditions. In rural areas 
where there are no nearby training programs, the bill would 
allow the Secretary to waive some of the restrictions so that a 
training program could be conducted at a nursing facility as 
long as the program would not be conducted by the nursing 
facility. CBO estimates that this provision would have no 
budgetary impact.
    This bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local, 
or tribal governments.
    If you wish for further details on this estimate, we will 
be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Robin 
Rudowitz.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee finds that H.R. 3633 
would have no inflationary impact.

                      Advisory Committee Statement

    No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act are created by this 
legislation.

             Section-by-Section Analysis of the Legislation

  Section 1. Permitting Waiver of Prohibition of Offering Nurse Aide 
   Training and Competency Evaluation Programs in Certain Facilities

    Section 1 of the bill amends section 1819(f)(2) and section 
1919(f)(2) of the Social Security Act to authorize a waiver of 
the prohibition of offering nurse aide training and competency 
evaluation programs in certain facilities upon State 
determination that no similar program is in existence within a 
reasonable distance of the facility, an adequate environment 
exists for operating the program in the facility, and the State 
long-term care ombudsman has been notified of the above.

                          (ii) assures, through an oversight 
                        effort, that an adequate environment 
                        exists for operating the program in the 
                        facility, and
                          (iii) provides notice of such
