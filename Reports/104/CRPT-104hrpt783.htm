SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

  Section 101 of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 
1974 (42 U.S.C. 5601) is amended to read as follows:
                               ``findings
  ``Sec. 101. (a) The Congress finds the following:
          ``(1) There has been a dramatic increase in juvenile crime, 
        particularly violent crime. Weapons offenses and homicides are 
        the 2 fastest growing violent crimes committed by juveniles, 
        and offenders under the age of 21 committing more than \1/4\ of 
        all violent crime.
          ``(2) This problem should be addressed through a 2-track 
        common sense approach that addresses the needs of individual 
        juveniles and society at large by promoting--
                  ``(A) quality prevention programs that--
                          ``(i) work with juveniles, their families, 
                        community-based organizations, take into 
                        consideration such factors as whether or not 
                        juveniles have been the victims of family 
                        violence (including child abuse and neglect); 
                        and
                          ``(ii) are designed to provide juveniles with 
                        the education and other skills they need to 
                        prevent their involvement in delinquency 
                        activities; and
                  ``(B) programs that assist in holding juveniles 
                accountable for their actions, including a system of 
                graduated sanctions for each delinquent act, requiring 
                juveniles to make restitution for the damage caused by 
                their delinquent acts, and methods for increasing 
                victim satisfaction with respect to the penalties 
                imposed on juveniles for their acts.
  ``(b) Congress must act now to reform this program by focusing on 
juvenile delinquency prevention programs, as well as programs that hold 
juveniles accountable for their acts. Without true reform, the criminal 
justice system will not be able to overcome the challenges it will face 
in the coming years when the number of juveniles is expected to 
increase by 30 percent.''.

        public safety by encouraging accountability for acts of 
        juvenile delinquency; and

    On August 1 and August 2, 1996, the Committee on Economic 
and Educational Opportunities assembled to consider H.R. 3876. 
Representative Cunningham, Subcommittee Chairman for the Early 
Childhood, Youth, and Families Subcommittee offered an 
amendment in the nature of a substitute. The Substitute 
incorporated several suggestions from the minority. Further 
amendments to the amendment in the nature of the substitute 
were accepted and the Committee adopted the amendment in the 
nature of a substitute, as amended. H.R. 3876 was favorably 
reported out of Committee on August 2, 1996 by a recorded vote 
of 23-2.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

                            juvenile justice

Program history

    The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 
(P.L. 93-415) inaugurated a comprehensive effort to address the 
increase in juvenile crime during that time period. The Act 
created an Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention, (OJJDP), in the Department of Justice. OJJDP 
administers grants for the purposes of improving the juvenile 
justice system and preventing juvenile delinquency. In addition 
to establishing OJJDP, the Act created the National Institute 
for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to serve as an 
information and training center. It also established a smaller 
assistance program for Runaway Youth in the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services). 
In 1984, Congress expanded the 1974 Act by authorizing the 
Missing Children's Assistance Program (P.L. 98-473).
    When Congress enacted the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 1974, it chose a course similar to that of 
State reforms. The Act required that States separate juveniles 
from adults in secure facilities in order to be eligible for 
Federal formula grant monies. It placed a major emphasis on 
diverting youth from the legal system and placing them in 
community-based treatment centers.
    As Congress reauthorized the Act in 1977, 1980, 1984 and 
1988, five policy changes occurred: (1) the position of the 
Administrator of OJJDP within the Department of Justice, (2) 
juveniles were required to be removed from adult jails and 
lockups; (3) judges were required to issue a ``valid court 
order,'' to hold a status offender in a secure facility--this 
was in an effort to redirect status offenders from secure 
lockups to community-based facilities; (4) renewed emphasis was 
placed on strengthening and maintaining family values; and, (5) 
additional emphasis was placed on the prevention and control of 
serious juvenile offenses and youth gangs,
    The 1977 and 1980 reauthorization enhanced the authority of 
the head of OJJDP by removing the position from within the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), and placing it 
under the general authority of the Attorney General.
    The removal of youth from adult detention centers, a theme 
that appeared in the 1980, 1984, and 1988 reauthorizations, 
went beyond the 1974 Act's mandate for the separation of 
juveniles from adults in secure facilities. The first 
reauthorization required States to remove juveniles from all 
adult detention centers in order to be eligible for OJJDP 
formula grant monies. The third reauthorization in 1988 
reaffirmed congressional support for the removal of juveniles 
from adult jails.
    As part of the effort to ensure the deinstitutionalization 
of youth and to treat status offenders differently from their 
more violent counterparts, the Act required that a judge must 
issue a valid court order in order for a status offender to be 
held in a secure facility. The 1980 reauthorization put in 
place the exception to the valid court order. The exception 
states that an adjudicated status offender could be 
incarcerated in a secure facility, if he or she violated the 
terms of the valid court order. In 1984 Congress defined a 
valid court order as ``a court order given by a juvenile court 
judge to a juvenile who has been brought before the court and 
made subject to a court order. The use of the word 'valid' 
permits the incarceration of juveniles for violation of a valid 
court order only if they received their full due process rights 
as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.''
    The 1980, 1984, and 1988 reauthorizations emphasized the 
need to address the rise in youth violence and juvenile gangs, 
and the perceived breakdown of the family unit.
    The 1988 reauthorization, contained in the Anti-Drug Abuse 
Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-690), established grant programs within 
OJJDP for the purposes of preventing juvenile gangs, and drug 
trafficking and treating drug abuse. The 1988 reauthorization 
provided for special emphasis programs designed to strengthen 
and maintain the family unit as a means to prevent and treat 
juvenile delinquency.

Outlining the need for change

    Today, 22 years after the creation of this Act, statistics 
on juvenile violence nationwide have fueled a reassessment of 
earlier Federal and State reform efforts. On March 7, 1996, 
OJJDP released a study reporting that:
          In 1994 law enforcement agencies made over 2.7 
        million arrests of persons under age 18--six percent of 
        which were for a Violent Crime Index offense (murder, 
        non-negligence manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and 
        aggravated assault).
          From 1985 to 1994, the percentage increases in 
        arrests have been greater for juveniles than adults.
          The juvenile arrests for violent crime shot up by 50% 
        between 1988 and 1994.
          In 1994, there were 2800 juveniles convicted as 
        murderers. Since 1984, the number of juvenile homicide 
        offenders has nearly tripled. The growth in homicides 
        has surpassed that among adults.
          The number of juveniles murdered increased by 82% 
        between 1984 and 1994.
          Between 1989 and 1993, the proportion of students 
        involved in gangs in school rose from 15 percent to 35 
        percent.
          The juvenile arrest rate for weapons violations 
        increased by 75% between 1987 and 1992.
          The number of juveniles killed with a firearm almost 
        tripled between 1984 and 1994.
    At a Department of Justice news briefing on May 13, 1996, 
Attorney General Janet Reno stated that, ``Twenty years ago, 
fewer than half our cities reported gang activity. A generation 
later, reasonable estimates indicate that there are now more 
than half a million gang members in more than 16,000 gangs on 
the streets of our cities. The result--more than 580,000 gang-
related crimes in 1993.''
    On December 17, 1995, the FBI released preliminary Uniform 
Crime Reporting figures for the first half of the year. FBI 
Director Louis J. Freeh noted that the new data was consistent 
with the recent downward trend in serious crime nationwide, 
though he stated that the level of violent crime is still 
intolerable.
    However, violent crime involving young people, both as 
perpetrators and victims, is on the rise--an alarming indicator 
of future trends. The number of juveniles arrested for weapons 
violations has skyrocketed--more than doubled over the past 
decade. In 1994, a weapons law violation was the most serious 
charge in 63,400 juvenile arrests. It is likely that many more 
arrests involved weapons violations. However, FBI coding 
procedures require an arrest to be classified by the most 
serious charge involved. Consequently, none of the juvenile 
arrests for homicides or rape involving a firearm would be 
categorized as a weapons violation since it would not be the 
most serious offense.
    The availability of weapons and drugs is both a contributor 
and a reflection of the rise in juvenile violent crime. For 
example, a Department of Justice study found that almost one-
fourth (23%) of those arrested for weapons offenses nationwide 
during 1993 were under the age of 18. Recent national surveys 
sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services 
indicate that juvenile drug use, especially marijuana, is 
rising across the country. Marijuana use among 12 to 17 year 
olds jumped 37 percent last year, to 8.2 percent--more than 
double the rate in 1992. Cocaine use by America's youth, now at 
nearly 1 percent, is nearly three times the level of 1992 and 
monthly use of LSD increased by more than 50 percent, rising by 
nearly 200 percent since 1992.
    Some criminologists and policymakers argue that we are on 
the verge of a teenage crime explosion, as the children of the 
baby boomers reach the age at which they are most likely to 
commit crimes. John J. DiIulio, Jr., a Princeton University 
professor of politics and public affairs, not only foresees a 
teenage crime wave, but also describes some youngsters as 
``superpredators,'' lacking in moral values and more violent 
than previous generations.
    According to a 1996 report released by OJJDP, if trends 
continue as they have over the past 10 years, juvenile arrests 
for violent crime will more than double by the year 2010. The 
statistics are more staggering when you break down the 
anticipated increases by the type of crimes. The number of 
juvenile arrests for murder is predicted to increase 145% over 
the 1992 level by the year 2010. Aggravated assaults are 
expected to increase by 129% over the same period of time. The 
rate of juveniles committing rape is expected to increase by 
66% and the rate of arrests for robbery is expected to increase 
by 58%.
    Furthermore, recent studies have shown that a small portion 
of the offending population are committing the most heinous and 
violent crimes. Studies have shown that chronic offenders, 
about 6% of those juveniles who come in contact with the 
juvenile justice system, are responsible for about two-thirds 
of all violent offenses. In a study on high risk inner city 
youth, chronic offenders, about 14% to 19% of the offending 
population, commit three quarters of the juvenile violent 
crimes.
    Given the growing number of studies and reports that 
indicate a dramatic increase in juvenile crime, particularly 
violent juvenile crime, it is the belief of the Committee that 
the current Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act 
must undergo major revisions. It must be reformed to 
effectively address the problems of juvenile delinquency and 
combat juvenile violent crime as it exists today.
    The Committee believes it is important for States and local 
communities to undertake activities which prevent juveniles 
from becoming involved in delinquent activities and committing 
violent criminal acts. At the same time, it is important that 
we also take steps to ensure that youth are accountable for 
their behavior. Accountability, in and of itself, can be used 
as a prevention tool. After all, 59% of the youth who are 
referred to juvenile court are one-time offenders; they never 
again come into contact with the juvenile court system.
    This legislation represents a new direction in efforts to 
prevent and control juvenile crime. It is the result of 
numerous meetings with the Minority and organizations and 
individuals interested in the issue of juvenile crime. It seeks 
to ensure youth receive appropriate punishments for their 
delinquent acts, and, at the same time, provides appropriate 
interventions to help ensure they are diverted from further 
delinquent activities.

                       RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH

    The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYP) was enacted as 
part of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 
1974 in order to help address the unique problems of runaway, 
thrownaway, or otherwise homeless youth. The problems of 
dealing with runaway and homeless youth are recognized as quite 
complex, multi-faceted and symptomatic of other problems 
adolescents are experiencing. The Act provides a variety of 
programs that range from providing crisis residential care to 
dealing with the risks of substance abuse, depression, 
depravation, illness, and sexual exploitation that face runaway 
and homeless youth today.
    The RHYP consists of three major programs, but primarily 
funds basic centers, i.e., local facilities that provide crisis 
residential care and counseling for runaway and homeless youth 
as well as counseling and after care services for the family 
(services provided following the youth's stay in the RHYP 
center). The law does not specify age or eligibility 
requirements for youth and is designed to meet the needs of 
runaway and homeless youth outside of the law enforcement and 
juvenile justice system. Youth generally may stay in the 
shelter up to two weeks. Basic center grants are made directly 
to the shelters, but dollar amounts are allocated according to 
each State's proportion of the population younger than 18 
years. The law states that 90 percent of the RHYP's 
appropriation be distributed as direct services. In addition, 
the program funds a national toll-free hotline where youth can 
receive information on shelter and services available to them.
    The Transitional Living Program (TLP) for Homeless Youth 
provides grants to local public and private organizations to 
address the shelter and service needs of homeless youth. This 
program is designed to meet the more complex, long term needs 
of older homeless youth ages 16-21. Grants are used to develop 
or strengthen community based programs which assist homeless 
youth in making a smooth transition to a productive adulthood 
and social self sufficiency. Grant money is also used to 
provide technical assistance to transitional living programs to 
enhance their capacity to acquire and maintain resources and 
service linkages in their local communities. It is estimated 
that between one-third and one-half of all youth served by the 
current runaway and homeless youth centers are homeless either 
through mutual agreement with their families or because they 
have been pushed out by a parent or legal guardian.
    A homeless youth accepted into the Transitional Living 
Program is eligible to receive shelter and services for up to 
540 days (18 months). The services include: information and 
counseling services in basic life skills, such as money 
management and housekeeping; interpersonal skill building, such 
as decision making and priority setting; educational 
advancement; job attainment; and mental and physical health 
care.
    The third major program of the RHYP is the Drug Education 
and Prevention Program (DEPP). The purpose of this program is 
to reduce and prevent the illicit use of drugs by runaway and 
homeless youth through service projects, research and 
demonstration programs. The program is designed to provide 
individual, family and group counseling to reduce or prevent 
drug abuse; develop and support peer counseling programs; 
develop and support community education programs including 
outreach to individual youth; provide assistance to runaway and 
homeless youth in rural areas through the development of 
support groups; provide training and information on drug abuse 
to persons involved in providing services to runaway and 
homeless youth; support research on the illicit use of drugs by 
runaway and homeless youth; and, improve the availability and 
coordination of local service programs assisting runaway and 
homeless youth. This program also funds technical assistance to 
runaway and homeless youth service providers.

                   MISSING CHILDREN'S ASSISTANCE ACT

    Concern over the growing number of missing children in the 
United States prompted Congress in 1982 to pass the Missing 
Children's Assistance Act which allowed the names of missing 
children to be entered into a data bank in the Department of 
Justice and through the National Crime Information Center and 
permit the exchange of records and information regarding 
missing children. The 1984 reauthorization of the Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act expanded the Federal 
role in this area. The Act defined the term ``missing child''; 
established a toll-free hot-line to report information on the 
location of any missing child; established a National Resource 
Center in the Department of Justice to coordinate public and 
private programs and to disseminate information to assist law 
enforcement officials in the recovery of missing children; and 
authorized grants for research projects and programs related to 
missing children's cases.

                                Summary

    Title I of the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 1996 amends the Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention Act to make substantial changes to the 
law. It streamlines overall State plan requirements and 
specifically modifies the four core State plan requirements to 
make them more flexible. The bill renames the Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention the Office of 
Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention. The bill 
retains and revises the Part D Gang prevention program (Gang-
Free Schools and Communities). Parts E, F, G and H of current 
law are eliminated as is the authority for a White House 
Conference on Juvenile Justice.
    Title II of the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 1996 contains amendments to the Runaway and 
Homeless Youth Act. The purposes of the RHYP remain relatively 
unchanged. It will continue to fund local facilities providing 
emergency residential care and counseling for runaway and 
homeless youth; continue to focus on reuniting youth with their 
families; and continue to offer grants for transitional living 
projects and help assist in drug education and prevention 
activities. The amendments consolidate three separate funding 
streams for the RHYP, TLP and DEPP into a single authorization 
and make numerous technical corrections.
    Title III of the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 1996 authorizes funding for the Missing 
Children's Assistance Act.
    Title IV of the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 1996 retains and revises the Title V 
Incentive Grant Program for Local Delinquency Prevention 
Programs.
    Title V includes the General Provisions.

                            Committee Views

                            juvenile justice

Changing the name of the act and the office

    H.R. 3876 renames the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention Act the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency 
Prevention Act and makes similar changes to references to 
juvenile ``justice'' throughout H.R. 3876. The name change and 
other changes throughout the bill reflect a change in purpose 
and focus in legislation.
    It also mirrors what is happening in society. The nature of 
juvenile crime has changed dramatically over the past decade. 
Juvenile crime is on the rise and becoming more violent. A slap 
on the wrist is no longer the most effective way of dealing 
with the more violent juvenile offenders. The current Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act does not recognize 
current trends in juvenile crime. We not only need to prevent 
crime, we need to control it in order to reduce the incidence 
of juvenile crime.
    While the Committee is changing the name of the Act and the 
name of the office, it is not the intention of the Committee to 
reduce the current emphasis on prevention programs. We do, 
however, clearly want to send a signal that the Federal 
government supports State and local efforts to control juvenile 
crime as well as efforts to prevent juvenile delinquency.
    In our view, the two most important approaches to attacking 
juvenile crime are clear: prevention and holding juveniles 
accountable for the crimes they commit. Controlling juvenile 
crime must start early with juveniles in order to make them 
understand that there are consequences for their actions. 
Sending the message to our nation's youth that they will be 
punished for their delinquent activities is one of the most 
effective means of crime control and prevention. This 
legislation supports both prevention and accountability 
activities. The name of the Act and the office should be 
changed to reflect the change in direction of our Federal 
juvenile justice program.

Providing flexibility to States in meeting the four core State plan 
        requirements

    In order for States to receive funds under the Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, they must meet four 
core State plan requirements, commonly referred to as 
``mandates.'' In addition, current law provides that a State 
must comply with each of the four mandates in order to receive 
one hundred percent of it's allotment. For each mandate with 
which a State is in compliance, it will receive 25 percent of 
its allotment. The four core requirements contained in current 
law are:
    1. Deinstitutionalization of Status Offenders.--Requires 
that status offenders not be placed in jails, lock-ups or 
secure detention and correctional facilities. The law was 
amended in 1988 to require a judge to go outside the court 
system to get clearance from an appropriate public agency 
before issuing a valid court order to hold a status offender in 
a secure facility.
    2. Separation of Juveniles from Adults in Institutions.--
Requires that juveniles housed with adults, be held out of 
``sight or sound'' of adults. Before the last reauthorization, 
the law had disallowed ``regular'' contact between adults and 
juveniles. The last reauthorization struck the word ``regular'' 
and disallowed ``all'' contact with adults. Current law also 
prohibits the use of part-time, full-time security staff and 
direct-care staff, of a jail or lockup for adults, to serve 
juveniles.
    3. Removal of Juveniles from Jails and Facilities for 
Adults.--Requires States to remove juveniles from adult jails 
or lockups, with a few exceptions.
    4. Overrepresentation of Minorities in Juvenile Justice.--
requires that States address efforts to reduce the proportion 
of minority juveniles detained or confined in secure 
facilities, jails and lockups, if such proportion exceeds the 
proportion of minorities represented in the general population.
    Over the years, the Committee has received information on 
the burdensome nature of the four core requirements. Several 
witnesses over the course of the Committee's four hearings on 
juvenile justice mentioned the burdens the mandates imposed at 
both the State and local level.
    In his testimony before the Committee, Thomas Corbett, 
Attorney General of the Commonwealth of PA, stated, ``I feel 
compelled to comment on the inflexibility of the regulations 
from a national perspective. * * * Someone at OJJDP still 
doesn't get it. The activities continue to be focused upon the 
rights of youth versus helping States identify activities which 
will assist them in the management of this new wave of 
dangerous juveniles. * * * I am not suggesting the repeal of 
the Act's core mandates. But irrational overregulation can 
cause excessive, needless work on already overworked 
professionals in our juvenile justice system.''
    Other witnesses pointed out problems with specific 
mandates. In each instance, the Committee has modified the 
existing mandates to provide more flexibility to the States in 
meeting these requirements.
            Deinstitutionalization of status offenders
    The Committee received testimony with respect to the 
mandate on the deinstitutionalization of status offenders. 
Jerry Kilgore, Virginia Secretary of Public Safety, stated, 
``Localities need the ability to detain status offenders in a 
secure environment. * * * More flexibility to deal with these 
offenders when they have their first exposure to the court 
system would enhance our chances of successful intervention.''
    Another witness, Lt. Dale Patch, Criminal Investigations 
Division, Des Moines, Iowa, stated, ``A fundamental problem in 
our juvenile justice system stems from a mandate in the JJDPA 
which calls for the ``Deinstitutionalization of Status 
Offenders'' which has caused States like Iowa to prohibit 
secure placement of children who are running away and not going 
to school * * * Our recommendation is to repeal the status 
offender mandate of the JJDPA and allow States to craft their 
own statutes to deal with status offenders.''
    H.R. 3876, in an effort to address these concerns, makes a 
number of changes to current law to increase the flexibility of 
the States to treat status offenders in the most appropriate 
manner. The bill returns to prior law by eliminating the need 
for a judge to receive a report from an ``appropriate public 
agency'', (other than a court or law enforcement agency), 
before the issuance of a valid court order allowing a juvenile 
to be held in a secure facility. This will enhance the ability 
of courts to detain status offenders when necessary, by 
allowing the judge to issue a valid court order without 
receiving a report from an appropriate public agency. It is 
important to note, however, that the rest of this mandate 
remains in place, making it clear that courts must exercise 
great care before holding young status offenders in a secure 
facility.
    However, the Committee recognizes the need to ensure the 
proper placement of youth who do commit status offenses. 
Therefore, in an amendment offered by Mr. Greenwood (R-PA), 
H.R. 3876, requires the appropriate child protective services 
agency to be promptly notified if a juvenile is held under a 
valid court order. The appropriate agency, after receiving a 
referral by the court, is required to personally interview the 
juvenile within 24 hours of the referral and to submit a 
recommendation to the court within 72 hours after the juvenile 
is taken into custody. After receipt of such report, the court 
is then required to conduct a hearing to determine two things. 
First, if the juvenile committed the status offense; second, 
the appropriate placement for the juvenile, pending disposition 
of the status offense that is the subject of the valid court 
order. While advice from an outside agency is still required, 
the Committee believes it is important that a judge be allowed 
to issue a valid court order prior to soliciting such input.
    This position also received support during hearings before 
the Committee. Linda O'Neal, Executive Director, Tennessee 
Commission on Children and Youth, stated, ``We should not 
eliminate the deinstitutionalization mandate. * * * However, 
there may be a need to eliminate new provisions added to the 
valid court order exception in 1992 that requires 
administrative review of juvenile court decisions regarding 
valid court orders. Perhaps review of such decisions should be 
handled through the judicial process, rather than through an 
administrative review process.''
    The Committee is also concerned about the ability of the 
court to hold runaways in order to reunite them with their 
parents. Parents must often travel across the country in order 
to be reunited with their children. However, current law 
prevents the courts from holding a juvenile for longer than 24 
hours, even if the child's parents are en route to pick up the 
child. H.R. 3876 addresses this concern by permitting status 
offenders to be held for purposes of reuniting them with their 
parents or guardian. The Committee urges the courts to exercise 
caution when holding runaways in order to reunite them with 
their families. It is important to ensure that such youth are 
not running away from an abusive situation at home.
            Separation of juveniles from adults in institutions
    Several witnesses also discussed the ``sight and sound'' 
separation mandate for periods when juveniles are held in the 
same facility with adults. Jerry Kilgore, Virginia Secretary of 
Public Safety, stated in his testimony before the Committee, 
``The requirement of absolute ``sight and sound'' separation 
places an unwieldy burden on many localities. * * * The result 
of this requirement forces local jails to under-utilize space 
that could otherwise be used to alleviate overcrowding.''
    The sentiment was also expressed by James Backstrom, Dakota 
County Attorney, MN (on behalf of the National District 
Attorneys Association), who stated in his testimony, ``* * * 
regulations which make it a violation for inadvertent contact 
to occur between a juvenile and adult offender should be 
eliminated * * * modifications to absolute ``sight and sound'' 
restrictions are both appropriate and necessary, as local law 
enforcement officials seek to cope with dramatic increases in 
violent juvenile crime.''
    H.R. 3876 modifies the current law provision to prohibit 
regular and incidental unsupervised contact. The Committee does 
not believe that sporadic encounters in hallways between 
juveniles and adults, as they are traveling to and from meals, 
exercise areas, etc. is harmful provided there is appropriate 
supervision of these incidental, infrequent meetings.
    This modification was supported during Committee hearings. 
According to Linda O'Neal, Executive Director to the Tennessee 
Commission (on Children and Youth on behalf of the Coalition 
for Juvenile Justice), ``With regard to sight and sound 
separation, the term ``regular'' could again be inserted in the 
separation mandate to allow for occasional, incidental 
contacts. This would make it easier for States to meet this 
mandate, as all but two now do.''
    Concerns were also raised regarding the prohibition on 
``shared staff'' as part of the sight and sound separation 
requirement. For example, an individual serving a meal to an 
adult could not serve a meal to a juvenile, even if they were 
not served at the same time. According to James Backstrom 
(speaking on behalf of the National District Attorneys 
Association), ``The prohibition of the use of shared staff in 
both juvenile and adult detention facilities should be 
eliminated. Reasonable restrictions, such as preventing staff 
from working in both facilities on the same shift, would be 
appropriate.'' The Committee agrees that this restriction is 
particularly burdensome, especially in small communities and in 
rural areas. The Committee further believes that staff should 
be able to work with both juveniles and adults as long as they 
have been appropriately trained. As such, H.R. 3876 would 
permit shared staff to work with juveniles, provided the staff 
has been trained to work with juveniles. States must provide 
assurances that there is in effect a State policy requiring 
such training.
            Removal of juveniles from jails and facilities for adults
    Witnesses also expressed concerns over provisions in 
current law that require separate facilities for juveniles and 
adults, if the juvenile is to be held for more than a twenty-
four hour period while awaiting an initial court appearance. 
This requirement was particularly burdensome in rural areas 
with a limited number of law enforcement officers and separate 
facilities for juveniles. While current law does provide some 
exceptions to this requirement, H.R. 3876 builds additional 
flexibility into the law by extending the period of time to up 
to 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, for which 
juveniles can be held in a facility with adults, prior to an 
initial court appearance.
    The Committee was also concerned that current law 
provisions did not adequately address the issue of where to 
house violent juveniles, who, after a determination at a 
probable cause hearing, are charged as an adult. The Committee 
is concerned about the adverse impact of housing such juveniles 
with non-violent offenders, as doing so could present a danger 
to the non-violent offenders. As such, the Committee allows 
States to hold violent juveniles charged or convicted as adults 
in facilities with adults as long as there is no regular, 
unsupervised incidental, contact with adults. Currently States 
can charge and prosecute violent juveniles as adults. The 
Committee believes that States should also be in a position to 
decide where to incarcerate such violent youth.
            Overrepresentation of minorities in juvenile justice
    H.R. 3876 also makes changes to the overrepresentation of 
minorities mandate. Current law focuses on the number of 
minorities in the judicial system compared to the general 
minority population and does not look at the actual number of 
crimes committed by minorities. It only focuses on how many 
juvenile minorities are incarcerated. Current law can be 
interpreted to force States to release violent youth of 
minority origin or to refuse to arrest delinquent youth, if 
their numbers in confinement exceed their numbers in the 
general population.
    The Committee is concerned about the interpretation of this 
mandate. While we believe a modified focus on the possible of 
over-representation of minorities in the juvenile crime system 
can be maintained in the law, we believe current law must be 
changed.
    The State of Virginia has spent over $800,000 just on 
reports required for compliance with this mandate. While they 
have found that a disproportionate number of minorities have 
been incarcerated compared to their percentage in the general 
population, they have also found this can be attributed to 
factors other than race. Such factors include economic 
conditions, family situation, severity of crime, and the number 
of past offenses. They have not found that sentences have been 
given out or that penalties have been enhanced based on race.
    Jerry Regier, Director, Oklahoma Department of Juvenile 
Justice, in testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Youth 
Violence on March 12, 1996, discussed a study published in late 
1993 analyzing this issue in the State of Oklahoma. According 
to the study, African-American juveniles represented 9.6% of 
the juvenile population in Oklahoma but comprised 25% of all 
juvenile arrests. Native American juveniles, on the other hand, 
comprised 11.2% of the juvenile population yet only 5.1% of the 
total arrested. According to Mr. Regier, ``Quotas are not the 
answer. Youth are placed in a system based on their acts, not 
their race. We do not plan to go out and arrest more Native 
American youth to get their numbers up, nor will we cease 
arresting African-American juveniles who commit crimes. Youth 
are arrested and adjudicated based on their acts, not their 
race.''
    The Committee bill maintains an over-representation 
mandate, but changes the focus so that attention is paid as to 
whether a certain minority population is over-represented among 
all youth that have committed an offense, rather than the 
number of minorities in the general population. The bill also 
allows a State to take into account ``all relevant factors.'' 
This would include factors that have a direct impact on a 
judge's sentencing decision, such as the type and intensity of 
the offense and the juvenile's family background.
    The Committee believes the criminal justice system should 
be color blind. Individuals charged for the same crime under 
the same circumstances should be treated uniformly by the 
juvenile justice system. The modifications made by H.R. 3876 to 
the current mandate will help ensure that our efforts eliminate 
the true bias in the juvenile justice system and does not 
create quotas, which could result in the release of violent 
juvenile offenders.
            Change in penalties for non-compliance
    Finally, the Committee bill modifies current law provisions 
allowing 25 percent of a State's funds to be held for each 
mandate for which it is not in compliance. Several witnesses 
discussed this issue during hearings before the Committee. 
James Backstrom, Dakota County Attorney, MN (on behalf of the 
National District Attorneys Association) stated, ``The funding 
prohibitions are * * * too drastic a penalty.'' Jerry Kilgore, 
Virginia Secretary of Public Safety also expressed this 
concern, and stated, ``the current strategy of reducing funding 
by 25% for each area of non-compliance and requiring that all 
remaining funds be dedicated to compliance improvement is 
unnecessarily punitive.''
    The Committee agrees with these witnesses and has modified 
the law to provide States with 50 percent of their State 
allotment, independent of their compliance with the four core 
requirements. States can still lose up to one-quarter of the 
remaining 50 percent of their allotment (12.5%) for each core 
requirement for which they are not in compliance. However, this 
change will ensure that States still receive funds with which 
to combat juvenile delinquency even if they are not in 
compliance with all of the mandates. It is the view of the 
Committee that States should not be denied important financial 
resources for combating juvenile crime, simply because they are 
having difficulties meeting the four core requirements. Not 
only do States suffer under current law requirements, but the 
juveniles who require services funded through this Act suffer 
as well. The changes to this provision contained in H.R. 3876 
represent a thoughtful solution to this problem. While still 
providing a financial incentive for States to meet the 
mandates, the penalties are not so harsh as to thwart State 
efforts to address issues related to juvenile delinquency.

Requiring juveniles to be accountable for their actions

    One theme which echoed throughout the hearings held by the 
Subcommittee was the need to hold juveniles accountable for 
their actions. Forty-four States have already strengthened 
their State laws with respect to violent juvenile offenders. At 
the Federal level we need to support States' efforts to deal 
with violent, repeat offenders as well as encourage efforts to 
demonstrate to nonviolent offenders that their delinquent 
behavior will not be tolerated. According to noted 
criminologist James Q. Wilson, ``There ought to be penalties 
from the earliest offense * * * so that juveniles are treated 
by the State the same way we treat our children. You don't 
ignore the fact that they're wrecking the house until they 
finally burn it down. You try to deal with it right away.''
    In addition, Jean Warner, in the Yale Law and Policy 
Review, stated, ``By reconfirming the moral base of the law and 
by emphasizing that those who commit crimes will be held 
accountable to their victims because it is `right' to do so, 
restitution may increase commitment to the moral order.''
    The Committee has, therefore, modified the section of the 
State plan outlining the purposes for which funds under this 
Act are spent. Now States can use Federal funds to support 
State programs that hold youth accountable for their actions. 
Specific items include:
    1. A system, subject to the discretion of the State, that 
provides for the prosecution as adults for those juveniles 
under 18 years of age, who commit an act that would be a 
violent crime if committed by an adult.
    2. A system of open records relating to any adjudication of 
juveniles less than 18 years of age, who are adjudicated 
delinquent for conduct that if committed by an adult would be a 
felony. The system must also meet certain requirements, such as 
making these records available to law enforcement agencies, the 
courts and school officials.
    3. Programs that hold juveniles accountable for their 
actions. Such programs could include the use of neighborhood 
courts or panels that increase victim satisfaction and require 
juveniles to make restitution for the damage they caused. Such 
a system could also include a system of graduated sanctions for 
juvenile delinquents that ensures an appropriate sanction for 
every delinquent act.
    4. Programs that utilize multidisciplinary interagency case 
management and information sharing procedures. Such programs 
would enable the juvenile justice and law enforcement agencies, 
schools and social service agencies to make more informed 
decisions regarding early identification, control, supervision, 
and treatment of juveniles who repeatedly commit violent and 
serious delinquent acts.
    5. The expanded use of probation officers. States could now 
permit nonviolent delinquent juveniles to remain at home with 
their families as an alternative to incarceration or 
institutionalization by assigning a probation officer to ensure 
that the juvenile follows the terms of their probation.
    Youth who do not believe that they will be punished for 
their inappropriate behavior are more likely to repeat their 
behavior. There is also an increased likelihood that the types 
of delinquent activities in which they engage will become more 
serious if they are not appropriately sanctioned. It is the 
view of the Committee that giving States the flexibility to use 
funds for accountability, prevention, and programs which 
provide appropriate sanctions for each delinquent act will 
allow States to more effectively address juvenile delinquency. 
It is the further belief of the Committee that these changes 
will allow the States to reduce the recidivism rate among 
juvenile offenders.

Consolidating juvenile justice programs

    The Committee bill eliminates four categorical programs 
authorized under current law: Boot Camps, Mentoring, State 
Challenge Activities, and Treatment for Juvenile Offenders Who 
are Victims of Child Abuse and Neglect. These programs were 
added during the 102nd Congress. Two of these programs, Part 
F--Treatment for Juvenile Offenders Who are Victims of Child 
Abuse or Neglect and Part H--Boot Camps, have never been 
funded. Funding for the Part E--State Challenge Activities and 
Part G--Mentoring Program received minimal funding. It is the 
view of the Committee that program dollars should be 
consolidated in order to provide States with one flexible 
funding stream to carry out activities to reduce juvenile 
delinquency. However, it is not the intention of the Committee 
to discourage the types of activities authorized by these 
programs. H.R. 3876 modifies the State plan section outlining 
the permissible uses of funds under this Act. States will now 
be allowed to use their funds for activities related to boot 
camps, mentoring, and the treatment of juvenile offenders who 
are victims of child abuse and neglect.
    The Committee bill also eliminates the authorization for 
the White House Conference on Juvenile Justice. This conference 
has never been held and it is the view of the Committee that 
funds authorized for this purpose would be better used for 
State and local efforts to combat juvenile crime and to provide 
direct services to the juvenile population.

Refocusing federal gang prevention efforts

    The existing Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention 
Act contains two gang prevention programs under Part D, Gang-
Free Schools and Communities and Community-Based Gang 
Intervention. It is the view of the Committee that the need 
does not exist for two gang prevention programs under this Act. 
Several Federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice, 
Education, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban 
Development administer a variety of anti-gang programs.
    The Committee does, however, recognize that there is a need 
to address this growing problem. According to the Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), ``law 
enforcement and media reports suggest that criminal youth gangs 
are active in nearly every State.'' OJJDP estimates, based on a 
survey of law enforcement officials in 35 cities, that there 
are almost 1,500 gangs and over 120,000 gang members 
nationwide. According to the FBI, juvenile gang killings rose 
by 371% from 1980 to 1992.
    In addition, a 1993 survey by the National Center for 
Education Statistics (NCES), a national sample of students from 
the sixth grade through the twelfth grade, found that 35 
percent of the students reported ``fighting gangs'' in schools. 
Students who were aware of the existence of gangs in schools 
were two times more likely to report weapons in school. 
Students reporting both weapons and gangs in school were at 
least twice as likely to be concerned that they might be 
victims of violent crime, namely physical attacks and robbery.
    As a result, the Committee has included one juvenile gang-
prevention program as part of the Juvenile Crime Control and 
Delinquency Prevention Act. However, it is the belief of the 
Committee that the program should be very flexible and permit 
communities to design programs which meet their specific needs. 
There is no one solution to addressing problems related to 
youth gangs. Gangs exist all across the country and differ from 
cities, to suburbs, to rural areas across the United States. 
Therefore, each local community must be free to design a 
program which meets their specific needs. The Committee bill 
provides broad flexibility to local communities in designing 
gang-prevention programs. H.R. 3876 permits communities to 
choose those individuals and organizations they feel will be 
most effective in assisting them in their efforts to address 
problems of youth gangs.
    Communities throughout the United States are already 
developing their own gang-prevention programs. It is the view 
of the Committee that we should be supporting such efforts, 
rather than trying to design a one-size fits all program. A 
good example of a successful gang-prevention program is one 
operated in Hawaii by Sidney Rosen, with Adult Friends for 
Youth. In his testimony before the Committee, Mr. Rosen 
described a youth gang intervention and treatment program which 
has successfully improved outcomes for gang members. Mr. Rosen 
pointed out his program had significantly improved high school 
graduation rates. In a survey of 79 gang members, the 
graduation rate had jumped from 20 to 70 percent. Eighty-seven 
percent of the youth surveyed were either working full time or 
pursuing additional schooling. In addition, only 10 percent of 
the survey group had been arrested and none had received a 
prison sentence. With many groups, there had been an evolution 
from gangs to social clubs. And, hostilities between gangs had 
also been terminated. Mr. Rosen received no Federal support for 
his program, which had been locally designed and implemented.
    Finally, it is the view of the Committee that gang-
prevention efforts under this Act should be focused on those 
gangs which present the biggest and most hostile threat to 
society, not those which are purely social in nature. As such, 
H.R. 3876 focuses the new gang-prevention program on those 
gangs that commit crimes, particularly violent crimes, those 
that unlawfully use firearms and other weapons, and those that 
traffic drugs.

General streamlining and flexibility

    The Committee believes it is very important to provide 
States with broad flexibility to design programs which meet 
their own unique needs in addressing problems of juvenile 
delinquency, especially juvenile crime. As such, the Committee 
has eliminated many unnecessary State plan requirements and 
other provisions which limit State flexibility. A number of 
witnesses testified in support of State and local flexibility. 
Ron Roberts of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, 
stated, ``I would encourage the Subcommittee to support the 
elements of this legislation that provide flexibility to design 
and implement local solutions to local problems.''
    In addition, the Committee has included language in H.R. 
3876 which limits the ability of the Administrator to establish 
rules, regulations and procedures only to the extent necessary 
to ensure compliance with the specific requirements of Title 
II. In addition, the bill prohibits the Administrator from 
establishing rules, regulations or procedures applicable to 
compliance with the four core requirements. It is the view of 
the Committee that the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention has issued regulations which are more 
prescriptive than the mandates themselves. For instance, while 
the law requires separate facilities for juveniles and adults, 
the regulations go much further. For example, Virginia is in 
the process of building a juvenile facility on the same 
property as a facility for adults. The facilities are located 
one quarter of a mile apart. However, Virginia has spent 
$50,000 to build a hill of dirt on the property to ensure 
juveniles cannot see the adult facility because the Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention ruled they would 
otherwise not be in compliance with the mandate.
    The bill also provides that States, which have their own 
laws requiring compliance with the mandates on 
deinstitutionalization of status offenders, separate facilities 
for juveniles and adults, and sight and sound separation of 
juveniles from adults when they are held in the same 
facilities, shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements under 
the Act. The bill does not include the mandate dealing with 
minority over-representation because this specific mandate 
already allows the State to design their own efforts to address 
instances of minority over-representation.
    This provision was supported by Jerry Kilgore, Virginia 
Secretary of Public Safety, who stated in his testimony before 
the Committee, ``Compliance monitoring and reporting 
requirements should be reduced for States such as Virginia, 
with State codes which prohibit the practices for which 
compliance monitoring is required.''
    The bill also provides the chief executive officer of each 
State with greater flexibility in designating the membership of 
the State advisory group, whose purpose is to advise the State 
on matters of juvenile justice. H.R. 3876 also requires, for 
the first time, that the State Attorney General or the State 
official with primary responsibility for overseeing the 
enforcement of State criminal laws is to be appointed as a 
member of the advisory group. The Act further stipulates this 
individual is to be consulted by the chief executive officer on 
the selection of other members of the group. The Committee 
strongly believes the individual in the State, be it the State 
Attorney General or some other official, who is responsible for 
overseeing the enforcement of State criminal laws should have a 
prominent role in planning for activities within the State 
which address juvenile crime. Their overall knowledge and 
expertise in this area should not be overlooked.
    Finally, in emphasizing increased flexibility for the 
States, the Committee reported bill deletes a vague and broadly 
worded provision from current law which requires States, as 
part of their 3-year plan for carrying out the purposes of the 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Protection Act, to provide 
that ``fair and equitable arrangements shall be made to protect 
the interests of employees affected by assistance'' under the 
Act \1\--including ``preservation of rights, privileges and 
benefits'' under existing collective bargaining agreements or 
otherwise, the ``continuation of collective bargaining 
rights,'' the protection of individual employees against a 
``worsening'' of their positions with respect to their 
employment, ``assurances of employment'' to State and local 
government employees who will be affected by programs funded 
under the Act, and training or retraining programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Section 223(a)(19).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Committee has several concerns with the provision. It 
is simply unfair to force State and local governments to absorb 
the potential administrative burden and expense of the labor 
provision as a cost (which is presumably passed on to the 
taxpayers) of doing business with Federal government. The 
provision is inconsistent with the move toward greater 
flexibility in the juvenile justice program and the Committee 
is not persuaded that its far-reaching requirements should be 
continued in law.
    As an initial matter, labor relations with regard to public 
sector employees has traditionally been the province of State 
and local governments. Particularly with regard to collective 
bargaining rights, the Congress has declined to interfere with 
the negotiations between State and local governments and their 
employees over the terms and conditions of employment. Thus, 
for example, the definition of covered employers in section 
2(2) of the National Labor Relations Act specifically excludes 
States and any political subdivisions thereof. While the 
reported bill would not prevent a State or local government 
from reaching agreements with any of its employees who may be 
affected by the provision of assistance under the Act, the 
Committee did not feel it prudent to mandate such extensive 
protections which cover virtually the entire employment 
relationship.
    While some have argued that the JJDPA's collective 
bargaining provision is the same or similar to section 13(c) of 
the Federal Transit Act \2\ (formerly the Urban Mass 
Transportation Act of 1964), and therefore should be adopted, 
such a contention misses the mark. Section 13(c) has been very 
difficult to administer, and, in any case was targeted at 
protecting private sector transit employees as ownership of 
mass transit operations was transferred, under far-reaching 
Congressional legislation, from the private sector to the 
public sector. In this context, employees who were covered by 
the collective bargaining protections of private sector Federal 
labor law, the National Labor Relations Act, would potentially 
lose such protections when their employment relationships 
became governed by public sector State and local law. In the 
context of juvenile justice programs, the employees who the 
collective bargaining provision is intended to benefit are 
currently, and will continue to be, State and local government 
employees. While the Committee declines to mandate continuation 
of collective bargaining and other protections for this class 
of State and local government employees, it should be noted 
that the Committee bill does not limit in any way the 
application to these employees of the numerous Federal labor 
laws where the Congress has made a judgment to extend 
protections to public sector employees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Codified at 49 U.S.C. section 5333(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finally, even if the Committee were disposed to involve the 
Federal government in dictating to the States how to define the 
terms and conditions of the employment relationships with their 
employees, the almost unlimited scope of the subject provision 
is in itself unacceptable. The broad language of the current 
law's provision seems to require a guarantee that any employees 
affected by the assistance provided under the Act will never 
have any change in the terms or privileges of their employment. 
The language appears to provide for the continuation of 
collective bargaining rights without regard to whether or not 
there continues to be majority support for the elected 
bargaining representative, or when a collective bargaining 
agreement expires. The provision requires that individual 
employees be protected from a ``worsening'' of their employment 
positions--a term which is not defined and may often be ``in 
the eyes of the beholder.'' These requirements threaten to lock 
in for perpetuity the status quo. In today's dynamic 
environment, no workplace can be insulated from change in this 
sweeping manner.
    It is the view of the Committee that this increased 
flexibility will go a long way in assisting States to develop 
innovative programs to reduce the incidence of juvenile 
delinquency.

                       RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH

    In recent years, there have been many proposals to 
consolidate RHYP, TLP and DEPP into one comprehensive program 
for runaway and homeless youth. The current law configuration 
of three separate funding streams has proven to be piecemeal, 
unnecessary and duplicative. There has been agreement that 
consolidation would significantly reduce the burden of grant 
applications and administration for agencies serving runaway 
and homeless youth. Additionally, local communities need and 
want greater flexibility in designing services to this target 
population. The Committee report accompanying the Labor, Health 
and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill for 
fiscal year 1996 directly addressed the need for a consolidated 
authorization by stating ``The budget request proposed to 
consolidate these programs; the (Appropriations) Committee has 
not done this because it is not authorized by law''. The need 
for consolidation of these programs was additionally part of 
their rationale in defunding the Drug Education Prevention 
Program. ``The elimination of small categorical programs also 
saves Federal administrative costs, and reduces bureaucratic 
paperwork and grant forms that must be filled out by the local 
providers''. Additionally, both the Bush and Clinton 
administrations' have proposed consolidation of these programs.
    While the desire to consolidate the funding streams has 
been non-controversial, the Committee has taken special steps 
to preserve the distinct differences between the basic center 
grants and transitional living programs and in particular, not 
to administer funds for both programs under a single formula 
allocation. In testimony before the Committee, James Braun, 
President and CEO of Youth in Need, St. Charles, MO stated:

          The care of runaways and helping homeless youth 
        transition to productive adulthood cannot and should 
        not be provided under the same program. Consequently, 
        transitional living programs for older homeless youth, 
        while part of the continuum of services, should remain 
        distinct from the basic centers program * * * I would 
        urge that any streamlining of RHYA avoid blending, and 
        thus weakening, these distinct short term and long term 
        services.

    The Committee, working in conjunction with the Department 
of Health and Human Services, and the minority staff 
constructed legislation that directly addresses the 
consolidation concerns. The legislation consolidates the 
authorization for the current Runaway and Homeless Youth, 
Transitional Living for Homeless Youth, and the Drug Education 
and Prevention for Runaway and Homeless Youth programs into a 
single funding stream, while retaining the formula based 
allocation for basic center grants and the national competitive 
process for transitional living grants. The Runaway and 
Homeless Youth Program will continue to provide grants to local 
public and private organizations to establish and operate local 
runaway and homeless youth centers to address the crisis needs 
of runaway and homeless youth and their families. Grants will 
continue to be used to develop or strengthen community based 
centers which are outside the law enforcement, juvenile 
justice, child welfare and mental health systems. Additionally, 
home-based, street-based and drug education and prevention 
activities are all allowable uses of funds under the basic 
center grants. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act continues to 
require that 90 percent of the program funds be used to 
establish and operate basic centers and transitional living 
programs which meet the immediate needs of runaway and homeless 
youth. Basic center grants would continue to be allotted among 
the States based on each State's population under 18 years of 
age. Applications for basic center grants are selected for 
funding through a competitive review process based on each 
State's allocation of funds under the formula.
    The Transitional Living Program would no longer have a 
separate funding stream, but would continue to receive no less 
that 20% of the appropriation. The Transitional Living grants 
will continue to be awarded by the Secretary on a national 
competitive basis.
    Despite the fact that the Drug Education and Prevention 
Program (DEPP) did not receive funding in FY '96, the Committee 
recognizes the importance of drug education and prevention 
among the runaway and homeless youth population and continues 
to make it an allowable use of funds under the basic center 
grants.
    In addition to the funds which directly support basic 
centers and temporary shelters for runaway and homeless youth, 
approximately 10 percent of the funds in each of the past five 
years have been used to fund projects which support and 
strengthen the work of the shelters. These include: the 
national toll free runaway and homeless youth hotline, training 
and technical assistance activities; research and demonstration 
projects; and methods to improve program administration, 
outreach, and prevention activities among local shelters. These 
activities would continue under the Committee legislation.
    The Committee bill corrects several legislative drafting 
errors from the previous authorization. One of the most 
substantive corrections is to the Grants for Prevention of 
Sexual Abuse and Exploitation. This program was included in the 
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 as an 
amendment to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. The amendments 
were not executed because of incorrect section references. This 
program allows the Secretary to make grants to private non-
profit agencies for street based outreach and education 
including treatment, counseling, information and referral to 
runaway, homeless and street youth who are at risk of sexual 
abuse. Despite the drafting error, the program did receive $5.5 
million in funding in FY '96 from the Violent Crime Trust Fund. 
In correcting the technical errors, it is the intent of the 
Committee that this program continue to receive funding from 
the Violent Crime Trust Fund. The authorization is updated to 
the year 2000 at ``such sums''.
    The Committee bill significantly improves the operation and 
effectiveness of the RHYP by streamlining the Act; reducing the 
number of separately authorized programs; removing duplicative 
provisions, and improving the organization of the Act. It 
changes reporting requirements and requires HHS to submit a 
biennial (instead of annual) report to Congress. Additionally, 
the bill repeals the separately authorized Temporary 
Demonstration Projects to Provide Service to Youth in Rural 
Areas which has never received an appropriation. The bill 
highlights the need for runaway and homeless youth services in 
rural areas in the findings section of the text. The Act has 
been successful in helping to meet the needs of runaway and 
homeless youth. The Committee amendments will help to 
strengthen these activities and protect youth by keeping them 
off the streets, away from criminal activities and out of 
desperate circumstances. The Committee hopes that these 
programs will continue to focus on youth with the greatest need 
for these services and continue to reunite youth with their 
families.

                         MISSING CHILDREN'S ACT

    Title III of the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency 
Prevention Act makes two minor amendments to The Missing 
Children's Assistance Act. The Missing Children's Assistance 
Act makes grants available to develop programs that assist in 
the recovery of missing and exploited children. The National 
Resource Center on Missing Children within the Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) at the 
Department of Justice provides such services as a toll free 
hot-line to report sightings of missing children, entering 
missing children's names in the National Criminal Information 
Center's computerized database; coordination among Federally 
funded programs relating to missing children; information on 
effective models of Federal, State and local programs for the 
recovery of missing children; training and technical assistance 
to State clearinghouses, nonprofit organizations, prosecutors, 
law enforcement personnel, and attorneys. The Committee bill 
extends the authorization through the year 2000 and repeals the 
special study and report that is currently underway. No other 
changes are made to this Act.

                  Oversight Findings of the Committee

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives and clause 2(b)(1) of 
rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee's oversight findings and recommendations are 
reflected in the body of this report.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that 
the enactment into law of H.R. 3876 will have no significant 
inflationary impact on prices and costs in the operation of the 
national economy. It is the judgment of the Committee that the 
inflationary impact of this legislation as a component of the 
federal budget is negligible.

                    Government Reform and Oversight

    With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(D) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee has received no report of oversight findings and 
recommendations from the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight on the subject of H.R. 3876.

                           Committee Estimate

    Clause 7 of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires an estimate and a comparison by the 
Committee of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out 
H.R. 3876. However, clause 7(d) of that rule provides that this 
requirement does not apply when the Committee has included in 
its report a timely submitted cost estimate of the bill 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                Application of Law to Legislative Branch

    Section 102(b)(3) of Public Law 104-1 requires a 
description of the application of this bill to the legislative 
branch. The bill does not prohibit legislative branch employees 
from otherwise being eligible for such services under these 
programs in this Act.

                       Unfunded Mandate Statement

    Section 423 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment 
Control Act requires a statement of whether the provisions of 
the reported bill include unfunded mandates; the bill provides 
funds for programs authorized under this bill at the State and 
local level and as such does not contain any unfunded mandates. 
The Committee also received a letter regarding unfunded 
mandates from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. 
See infra.

     Budget Authority and Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate

    With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(B) of 
rule XI of the House of Representatives and section 308(a) of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and with respect to 
requirements of clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of the House of 
Representatives and section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act 
of 1974, the Committee has received the following cost estimate 
for H.R. 3876 from the Director of the Congressional Budget 
Office:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                   Washington, DC, August 16, 1996.
Hon. William F. Goodling,
Chairman, Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, House of 
        Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3876, the Juvenile 
Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1996.
    Enacting H.R. 3876 would not affect direct spending or 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply 
to the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).
    Enclosure.

    2. Bill title: Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Economic and Educational Opportunities on August 2, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: H.R. 3876 would make many changes and 
additions to the federal laws relating to juvenile crime and 
delinquency prevention programs. The bill would authorize the 
appropriation of:
          $225 million for fiscal year 1997 and such sums as 
        may be appropriate for each of the fiscal years 1998 
        through 2000 to the Department of Justice to carry out 
        programs for controlling juvenile crime and preventing 
        juvenile delinquency;
          $10 million for fiscal year 1997 and such sums as may 
        be appropriate for each of the fiscal years 1998 
        through 2000 to the Department of Justice to make 
        grants for programs designed to reduce the 
        participation of juvenile in gangs;
          Such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal 
        years 1997 through 2000 to the Department of Health and 
        Human Services to make grants for programs to prevent 
        sexual abuse;
          $60 million for fiscal year 1997 and such sums as may 
        be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 
        2000 to the Department of Health and Human Services to

        make grants for missing children's assistance programs; 
        and
          $20 million for fiscal year 1997 and such sums as may 
        be appropriate for each of the fiscal years 1998 
        through 2000 to the Department of Justice to make 
        grants for local delinquency prevention programs.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming 
appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO estimates that 
enacting H.R. 3876 would result in costs to the Federal 
Government of $1.3 billion over the 1997-2002 period. The 
following table summarizes the estimated budgetary effects of 
H.R. 3876, both with and without adjustments for inflation for 
years in which the authorized amounts are not specified.

                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]

\1\ The 1996 level is the amount appropriated for that year.                                                    

    The costs of this bill fall within budget functions 500 and 
750.
    6. Basis of estimate: For the purpose of this estimate, CBO 
assumes that all amounts authorized by the bill for 1997 and 
all estimated amounts for 1998 through 2000 will be 
appropriated and that outlays will occur at historical rates 
for the authorized activities. ``Such sums'' authorizations 
were estimated by extending, both with and without adjustment 
for inflation, either the 1997 authorization provided in the 
bill or, if there is none, the 1996 appropriation for the 
program. Because current law authorizes $8 million for fiscal 
year 1997 and $15 million for fiscal year 1998 for the sexual 
abuse prevention programs, we assume that the bill would add no 
spending to that activity in those years.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.
    8. Estimated impact on State, local and tribal governments: 
H.R. 3876 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in 
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) and 
would not impose costs on state, local, or tribal governments. 
The bill would authorize 1997 appropriations of at least $158 
million for juvenile justice grants to states and of about $97 
million for grants to public and private entities for runaway 
and homeless youth programs, missing children's assistance, and 
local juvenile delinquency prevention programs. Similar amounts 
are authorized annually for 1998 through 2000. In order to 
remain eligible for these formula grants, state and local 
governments might be required to redefine programs aimed at 
curtailing juvenile delinquency. The Unfunded Mandates Reform 
Act of 1995 excludes such conditions of federal assistance from 
the definition of an intergovernmental mandate.
    In a number of cases, H.R. 3876 would ease requirements 
governing the implementation of juvenile justice programs. 
Specific criteria for membership on juvenile justice advisory 
boards would be eliminated; certain reporting requirements 
would be dropped; and prohibitions limiting the incarceration 
of juveniles with adults would be relaxed.
    In other cases, the bill would require grant recipients to 
refocus certain activities. State plans would be required to 
emphasize holding juvenile delinquents accountable through the 
use of neighborhood courts, restitution to victims, and other 
sanctions on the offender. Education programs would need to 
emphasize self-sufficiency and work skills in addition to 
reducing truancy and drop-outs.
    The bill would also add requirements to implementation 
plans needed to receive funding under the Runaway and Homeless 
Youth Act.
    Responsibility for making awards to local agencies under 
the Incentives Grants for Local Delinquency Prevention Programs 
Act would be transferred from the federal government to state 
governments. However, this transferred responsibility would 
only occur within the context of an overall state 
implementation plan.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would 
impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: None.
    11. Estimated prepared by:
          Federal Cost Estimate: Mark T. Grabowicz; Impact on 
        State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Leo Lex; Impact 
        on the Private Sector: Matthew Eyles.
    12. Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine, for Paul N. 
Van de Water, Assistant Director for Analysis.

        JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION ACT OF 1974

          * * * * * * *

              TITLE I--FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE

    [Sec. 101. (a) The Congress hereby finds that--
          [(1) juveniles accounted for almost half the arrests 
        for serious crimes in the United States in 1974 and for 
        less than one-third of such arrests in 1983;
          [(2) recent trends show an upsurge in arrests of 
        adolescents for murder, assault, and weapon use;
          (3) the small number of youth who commit the most 
        serious and violent offenses are becoming more violent;
          [(4) understaffed, overcrowded juvenile courts, 
        prosecutorial and public defender offices, probation 
        services, and correctional facilities and inadequately 
        trained staff in such courts, services, and facilities 
        are not able to provide individualized justice or 
        effective help;
          [(5) present juvenile courts, foster and protective 
        care programs, and shelter facilities are inadequate to 
        meet the needs of children, who, because of this 
        failure to provide effective services, may become 
        delinquents;
          [(6) existing programs have not adequately responded 
        to the particular problems of the increasing numbers of 
        young people who are addicted to or who abuse alcohol 
        and other drugs, particularly nonopiate or polydrug 
        abusers;
          [(7) juvenile delinquency can be reduced through 
        programs designed to keep students in elementary and 
        secondary schools through the prevention of unwarranted 
        and arbitrary suspensions and expulsions;
          [(8) State and local communities which experience 
        directly the devastating failures of the juvenile 
        justice system do not presently have sufficient 
        technical expertise or adequate resources to deal 
        comprehensively with the problems of juvenile 
        delinquency;
          [(9) existing Federal programs have not provided the 
        direction, coordination, resources, and leadership 
        required to meet the crisis of delinquency;
          [(10) the juvenile justice system should give 
        additional attention to the problem of juveniles who 
        commit serious crimes, with particular attention given 
        to the areas of sentencing, providing resources 
        necessary for informed dispositions, and 
        rehabilitation;
          [(11) emphasis should be placed on preventing youth 
        from entering the juvenile justice system to begin 
        with; and
          [(12) the incidence of juvenile delinquency can be 
        reduced through public recreation programs and 
        activities designed to provide youth with social 
        skills, enhance self esteem, and encourage the 
        constructive use of discretionary time.
    [(b) Congress finds further that the high incidence of 
delinquency in the United States today results in enormous 
annual cost and immeasurable loss of human life, personal 
security, and wasted human resources and that juvenile 
delinquency constitutes a growing threat to the national 
welfare requiring immediate and comprehensive action by the 
Federal Government to reduce and prevent delinquency.

                                [purpose

    [Sec. 102. (a) It is the purpose of this Act--

        evaluation of all federally assisted juvenile justice 
        and delinquency prevention programs;
          [(2) to provide technical assistance to public and 
        private nonprofit juvenile justice and delinquency 
        prevention programs;
          [(3) to establish training programs for persons, 
        including professionals, paraprofessionals, and

        delinquents or whose work or activities relate to 
        juvenile delinquency programs;
          [(4) to establish a centralized research effort on 
        the problems of juvenile delinquency, including the 
        dissemination of the findings of such research and all 
        data related to juvenile delinquency;
          [(5) to develop and encourage the implementation of 
        national standards for the administration of juvenile 
        justice, including recommendations for administrative, 
        budgetary, and legislative action at the Federal, 
        State, and local level to facilitate the adoption of 
        such standards;
          [(6) to assist State and local communities with 
        resources to develop and implement programs to keep 
        students in elementary and secondary schools and to 
        prevent unwarranted and arbitrary suspensions and 
        expulsions;
          [(7) to establish a Federal assistance program to 
        deal with the problems of runaway and homeless youth;
          [(8) to strengthen families in which juvenile 
        delinquency has been a problem;
          [(9) to assist State and local governments in 
        removing juveniles from jails and lockups for adults;
          [(10) to assist State and local governments in

          [(11) to assist States and local communities to 
        prevent youth from entering the justice system to begin 
        with.
    [(b) It is therefore the further declared policy of 
Congress to provide the necessary resources, leadership, and 
coordination (1) to develop and implement effective methods of 
preventing and reducing juvenile delinquency, including methods 
with a special focus on preserving and strengthening families 
so that juveniles may be retained in their homes; (2) to 
develop and conduct effective programs to prevent delinquency, 
to divert juveniles from the traditional juvenile justice 
system and to provide critically needed alternatives to 
institutionalization; (3) to improve the quality of juvenile 
justice in the United States; (4) to increase the capacity of 
State and local governments and public and private agencies to 
conduct effective juvenile justice and delinquency prevention 
and rehabilitation programs and to provide research, 
evaluation, and training services in the field of juvenile 
delinquency prevention; (5) to encourage parental involvement 
in treatment and alternative disposition programs; and (6) to 
provide for coordination of services between State, local, and 
community-based agencies and to promote interagency cooperation 
in providing such services.]


                                findings


  Sec. 101. (a) The Congress finds the following:
          (1) There has been a dramatic increase in juvenile 
        crime, particularly violent crime. Weapons offenses and 
        homicides are the 2 fastest growing violent crimes 
        committed by juveniles, and offenders under the age of 
        21 committing more than \1/4\ of all violent crime.
          (2) This problem should be addressed through a 2-
        track common sense approach that addresses the needs of 
        individual juveniles and society at large by 
        promoting--
                  (A) quality prevention programs that--
                          (i) work with juveniles, their 
                        families, community-based 
                        organizations, take into consideration 
                        such factors as whether or not 
                        juveniles have been the victims of 
                        family violence (including child abuse 
                        and neglect); and
                          (ii) are designed to provide 
                        juveniles with the education and other 
                        skills they need to prevent their 
                        involvement in delinquency activities; 
                        and
                  (B) programs that assist in holding juveniles 
                accountable for their actions, including a 
                system of graduated sanctions for each 
                delinquent act, requiring juveniles to make 
                restitution for the damage caused by their 
                delinquent acts, and methods for increasing 
                victim satisfaction with respect to the 
                penalties imposed on juveniles for their acts.
  (b) Congress must act now to reform this program by focusing 
on juvenile delinquency prevention programs, as well as 
programs that hold juveniles accountable for their acts. 
Without true reform, the criminal justice system will not be 
able to overcome the challenges it will face in the coming 
years when the number of juveniles is expected to increase by 
30 percent.

                adults for purposes of prosecution, of 
                juveniles under 18 years of age who commit an

                an adult, that is--
                          (i) equivalent to the records that 
                        would be kept of adults arrested for 
                        such conduct, including fingerprints

        a valid court order or a violation of section 922(x) of 
        title 18, United States Code, or a similar State 
        [law).] law) or alien juveniles in custody, or such

        the State to provide that such juveniles, if placed in 
        facilities, are placed in facilities which (i) are the 
        least restrictive alternatives appropriate to the needs 
        of the child and the community; (ii) are in reasonable

        be given to and that assistance will be available for 
        approaches designed to strengthen the families of

        members when possible and appropriate and the provision 
        of family counseling during the incarceration of 
        juvenile family members and coordination of family

        other non-Federal funds that would in the absence of 
        such Federal funds be made available for the programs 
        described in this part, and will in no event replace 
        such State, local, and other non-Federal funds;

        proportion, with relevant factors held constant,

                notified that such juvenile is held under such 
                order;
                  (B) not later than 24 hours after such

        amount that exceeds 105 percent of the amount the State 
        received under such section for fiscal year 1992, all 
        of such excess shall be expended through or for 
        programs that are part of a comprehensive and

terminate any State's eligibility for funding under this part 
for a fiscal year beginning before January 1, 1993, unless the 
Administrator determines that the State is in substantial 
compliance with the requirement, through achievement of 
deinstitutionalization of not less than 75 percent of such 
juveniles or through removal of 100 percent of such juveniles 
from secure correctional facilities, and has made, through 
appropriate executive or legislative action, an unequivocal 
commitment to achieving full compliance within a reasonable 
time not exceeding 2 additional years.

certifies to an appropriate district court of the United States 
that the juvenile court or other appropriate court of a State 
(1) does not have jurisdiction or refuses to assume 
jurisdiction over said juvenile with respect to such alleged 
act of juvenile delinquency, or (2) does not have available 
programs and services adequate for the needs of juveniles.

shall be surrendered to the appropriate legal authorities of 
such State.
  [``If an alleged juvenile delinquent is not surrendered to 
the authorities of a State or the District of Columbia pursuant

juvenile sixteen years and older alleged to have committed an 
act after his sixteenth birthday which if committed by an adult 
would be a felony punishable by a maximum penalty of ten years 
imprisonment or more, life imprisonment, or death, criminal 
prosecution on the basis of the alleged act may be begun by 
motion to transfer of the Attorney General in the appropriate 
district court of the United States, if such court finds, after 
hearing, such transfer would be in the interest of justice.

findings with regard to each factor shall be made in the 
record, in assessing whether a transfer would be in the 
interest of justice: the age and social background of the 
juvenile; the nature of the alleged offense; the extent and 
nature of the juvenile's prior delinquency record; the 
juvenile's present intellectual development and psychological 
maturity; the nature of past treatment efforts and the 
juvenile's response to such efforts; the availability of

proceeding has reached the stage that evidence has begun to be 
taken with respect to a crime or an alleged act of juvenile 
delinquency subsequent criminal prosecution or juvenile 
proceedings based upon such alleged act of delinquency shall be 
barred.

offense.

custodian are financially unable to obtain adequate 
representation. In cases where the juvenile and his parents, 
guardian, or custodian are financially able to obtain adequate 
representation but have not retained counsel, the magistrate

attorney's fees or may direct the juvenile, his parents, 
guardian, or custodian to retain private counsel within a 
specified period of time.
  [``The magistrate may appoint a guardian ad litem if a parent 
or guardian of the juvenile is not present, or if the 
magistrate has reason to believe that the parents or guardian 
will not cooperate with the juvenile in preparing for trial, or 
that the interests of the parents or guardian and those of the 
juvenile are adverse.
  [``If the juvenile has not been discharged before his initial 
appearance before the magistrate, the magistrate shall release 
the juvenile to his parents, guardian, custodian, or other 
responsible party (including, but not limited to, the director 
of a shelter-care facility upon their promise to bring such 
juvenile before the appropriate court when requested by such 
court unless the magistrate determines, after hearing, at which 
the juvenile is represented by counsel, that the detention of 
such juvenile is required to secure his timely appearance 
before the appropriate court or to insure his safety or that of 
others.''

in or near his home community. The Attorney General shall not 
cause any juvenile alleged to be delinquent to be detained or 
confined in any institution in which the juvenile has regular 
contact with adult persons convicted of a crime or awaiting 
trial on criminal charges. Insofar as possible, alleged 
delinquents shall be kept separate from adjudicated 
delinquents. Every juvenile in custody shall be provided with 
adequate food, heat, light, sanitary facilities, bedding,

is not brought to trial within thirty days from the date upon 
which such detention was begun, the information shall be 
dismissed on motion of the alleged delinquent or at the 
direction of the court, unless the Attorney General shows that 
additional delay was caused by the juvenile or his counsel, or 
consented to by the juvenile and his counsel, or would be in 
the interest of justice in the particular case. Delays 
attributable solely to court calendar congestion may not be 
considered in the interest of justice. Except in extraordinary 
circumstances, an information dismissed under this section may 
not be reinstituted.''

concerning an alleged or adjudicated delinquent, it may commit 
him, after notice and hearing at which the juvenile is 
represented by counsel, to the custody of the Attorney General 
for observation and study by an appropriate agency. Such 
observation and study shall be conducted on an outpatient 
basis, unless the court determines that inpatient observation 
and study are necessary to obtain the desired information. In 
the case of an alleged juvenile delinquent, inpatient study may 
be ordered only with the consent of the juvenile and his 
attorney. The agency shall make a complete study of the alleged 
or adjudicated delinquent to ascertain his personal traits, his 
capabilities, his background, any previous delinquency or 
criminal experience, any mental or physical defect, and any 
other relevant factors. The Attorney General shall submit to 
the court and the attorneys for the juvenile and the Government 
the results of the study within thirty days after the

                             MINORITY VIEWS

                              introduction

    In 1974, Congress created the Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention Act (hereafter referred to as ``the 
Act'') to provide a comprehensive system of delinquency 
prevention and rehabilitation services to potential and actual 
juvenile offenders, with the parallel goal of protecting public 
safety. In the more than 20 years since its enactment, the Act 
has evolved to include 4 core mandates designed to support the 
Act's goal of furthering integrity in the juvenile justice 
system and delinquency prevention. These requirements are the 
following: (1) the deinstitutionalization of status offenders; 
\1\ (2) sight and sound separation of juvenile and adult 
offenders; (3) removal of juveniles from adult jails and 
lockups; and (4) efforts to address the disproportionate 
confinement of minority youth in secure facilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Status offenders are juveniles who have committed offenses, 
such as truancy and running away, which would not be a crime if 
committed by an adult.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Republican Majority has crafted a juvenile justice 
reauthorization bill (H.R. 3876) that eliminates and severely 
weakens many of the most effective provisions of the current 
Act, particularly these mandates. H.R. 3876 renders mandates 
(1), (3), and (4) virtually ineffective. The impact of changes 
to these mandates (discussed later in greater detail) will 
almost certainly result in a sharp increase in the number of 
juveniles being detained with criminal offenders, an increase 
in the number of juveniles being placed in adult jails, and 
weakened State analysis of disproportionate minority 
confinement in the juvenile justice system. The proposed change 
to the second mandate (sight and sound separation) would 
increase contact between juvenile and adult offenders, an 
alarming prospect.
    It is ironic that the Republican Majority would designate 
its bill ``the Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency 
Prevention Act of 1996.'' As to the goal of prevention, the 
bill unjustly proposes to cut Title V funds (incentive grants 
for local delinquency prevention programs) by $10 million, one-
third of its funding level. Moreover, H.R. 3876 contains 
numerous proposals that have already proven ineffective in 
reducing juvenile crime. For instance, the bill encourages 
States to prosecute children as adults. And yet, study after 
study shows that such an approach is not likely to reduce 
juvenile crime. Children tried as adults have a higher 
recidivism rate than children tried as juveniles. Furthermore, 
the court process that precedes the sentencing phase in adult 
court takes longer than its corollary in juvenile court, 
despite unambiguous and convincing findings that the swiftness 
by which a sanction is carried out is crucial to meaningful 
juvenile behavior modification.
    We again must express our dismay with the legislative modus 
operandi employed by the Republican Majority to circumvent full 
consideration of amendments to less than perfect legislation. 
Tucked within H.R. 3876 is an irrelevant, anti-labor provision 
that would repeal vital labor protections for workers employed 
in juvenile detention facilities. Our colleague Representative 
Rob Andrews (D-NJ) offered a straightforward amendment to 
retain those protections; no case have ever been made for 
eliminating those protections. But rather than permit each of 
us the right to express our opinion on the Andrews amendment, 
the Committee's Republican leadership cut off debate, and 
exercised procedural heavy-handedness that prevented 
consideration of dozens of remaining Democratic and Republican 
amendments. Had the Committee process proceeded fairly and 
deliberately, maybe H.R. 3876 could have been improved in such 
a manner as to facilitate effective reduction of juvenile 
crime.

              the act's core mandates should be maintained

Jail removal mandate

    In 1980, Congress amended the Act to require the removal of 
juveniles from adult jails and lockups. This change was driven 
by the adverse impact of housing juvenile offenders with adult 
criminals, including high suicide rates, physical, mental, and 
sexual assaults, and exposure of children to serious adult 
offenders and mental patients. We oppose the Majority's 
decision to retreat to these dangerous conditions by allowing 
States to house juveniles of any age, charged or convicted of 
violent crimes as adults, with adult criminals on a permanent 
basis. We also object to the fact that the bill would further 
allow juveniles to be temporarily housed with adults for up to 
48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays).
    Juveniles placed in adult prisons today are in greater 
danger than they were 20 years ago. Research demonstrates that 
children in adult institutions are 5 times more likely to be 
sexually assaulted than juveniles confined in juvenile 
facilities. Sexual assault becomes life-threatening in light of 
the tragic fact that many adult prisoners are HIV-infected. The 
Journal of the American Medical Association reports that the 
incidence of AIDS among incarcerated adults is 6 times that of 
the general population. Children in adult institutions are 
twice as likely to be beaten by staff and 50 percent more 
likely to be attacked with a weapon than juveniles confined in 
juvenile facilities.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ In a recent tragedy on April 25, 1996, 6 adult prisoners 
murdered a seventeen years old boy while he was incarcerated in the 
juvenile cellblock of an adult in Ohio.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to its harmful, indeed life-threatening, 
effects on children, the unsound policy of sending youngsters 
into adult prisons does nothing to reduce crime. The most 
recent studies demonstrate that putting young offender in adult 
prisons actually leads to more crime, higher prison costs, and 
increased violence. Juveniles housed with adult offenders often 
begin to identify themselves as ``criminals''. A recent 
University of Florida study found that juveniles in adult 
prisons were more likely to commit serious crimes after their 
release than juveniles sent to juvenile facilities for the 
commission of similar offenses. Furthermore, juveniles 
prosecuted as adults and incarcerated in adult prisons tend to 
run afoul of the law again and again, committing even more 
serious new offenses.\3\ Sadly, these findings do not surprise 
us. Crime reduction and juvenile delinquency protection cannot 
be well served by policies that send teenagers to adult 
facilities where they are exposed to sophisticated, dangerous 
adult criminals.

    \3\ Bishop, Frazier, Lanza-Kaduce, and Winner, ``The Transfer of 
Juveniles to Criminal Court: Does It Make a Difference?'' 42 Crime and 
Delinquency 171 (1996).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is illogical to attempt to reduce juvenile crime without 
acknowledging the root causes and aggravating factors that lie 
at the heart of this issue. Recent research shows that most 
juvenile delinquents begin their troubled paths as severely at-
risk children, and juveniles who commit the worst crimes have 
usually suffered a lifetime of abuse and neglect. A study by 
the National Institute of Justice found that a child who 
suffers from abuse and neglect is 40 percent more likely to 
become delinquent. Moreover, numerous studies find that more 
juvenile offenders come from families plagued by violence, 
chaos, and high rates of drug and alcohol abuse. A 1996 study 
by the Rand Corporation concluded that early-childhood 
interventions and graduation incentives are more socially 
effective and cost effective at reducing crime than so called 
``get tough'' policies. More specifically, the Rand report 
found that a $1 million investment in a program offering 
educational incentives to at-risk youths (including tutoring 
and modest financial awards), could avert more than 250 crimes. 
Similarly, the researchers found that spending the same amount 
on early intervention, such as preparing parents to better care 
for their children, could avert more than 150 crimes, as 
compared to ``3 Strikes'' laws, which only avert 61 crimes.
    The Republican Majority cannot reasonably believe that 
children confined with habitual criminals will become law 
abiding citizens once released. The lack of rehabilitative 
services for juveniles in adult prisons (including education, 
and vocational and mental health services) exacerbates the 
inability of young offenders to become law-abiding adults after 
leaving prison. We are deeply troubled with the overwhelming 
emphasis of the Republicans on punishing and confining 
juveniles, rather than on trying to prevent juvenile 
delinquency in the first place.
    Dangerous juvenile offenders deserve confinement; citizens 
and communities must be protected. But, granting State's 
greater authority to house children with adult criminals is not 
a viable or logical means to that end.

Disproportionate minority confinement (DMC)

    Research has consistently shown that minority adolescents 
are overrepresented at all stages (i.e., arrest, adjudication, 
sentencing, secure detention, and secure incarceration) on the 
juvenile justice spectrum. In the 1970's and 1980's statistics 
showed that a minority youth is more likely to receive formal 
sanctions, to be sentenced to secure confinement, and to be 
transferred to criminal court, than a white youth. This 
disparity exists independent of the type of offense, the 
youth's previous arrest record, or his or her family structure.
    In 1991, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention (OJJDP) examined ``the role which minority status 
may play in the processing of youth through the juvenile 
justice system.'' The OJJDP acknowledged the existence of 
racial disparity within the juvenile justice system and 
concluded that the disproportional treatment of minorities 
often ``accumulate[s] and become[s] more pronounced as minority 
youth are processed further into the juvenile system.'' In 
1992, Congress sought to focus national attention on the 
reemergence of racism within the juvenile justice system and 
amended the Act to include the disproportionate minority 
confinement (DMC) mandate. The DMC mandate simply requires the 
States to conduct studies to determine if, in fact, the number 
of minority youth in secure confinement is disproportionate to 
their representation in the general population. If a State 
reaches that determination, it must address the causes of the 
overrepresentation. As of 1994, 55 States and territories 
completed such data collection. All but 9 states had identified 
a DMC problem and initiated intervention planning.
    While no State has ever lost funding because of 
noncompliance with the DMC mandate, the Republican Majority now 
effectively wants to repeal it. Under H.R. 3876, States would 
measure disproportionate minority confinement relative to the 
``total population of juveniles who are brought into the 
juvenile justice system.'' This comparison begs a most 
fundamental question: Is there not bias even at the ``entry 
point'' when the initial decision to arrest occurs? Indeed, 
studies have shown that at that ``entry point,'' minority youth 
are arrested at a higher rate than white youth. The modified 
DMC comparison proposed in H.R. 3876 is flawed and undermines 
useful analysis of racial bias in the juvenile justice system.
    The Republican Majority further denigrates the DMC mandate 
by injecting ``relevant factors'' into the equation without any 
qualitative identification of what factors may indeed be 
relevant. Instead, they have developed an arbitrary list of 
factors that will once again conceal, rather than identify, the 
role of race in the juvenile justice system. The cost to the 
States in conducting studies that take account of these 
arbitrary factors will discourage the States from conducting 
studies at all.
    We recognize that the Republican Majority is hell-bent on 
attacking any ``quota,'' no matter how tenuous the 
characterization. Thus, even a provision as sensible as the DMC 
mandate has become an affirmative action ``boogeyman'' to the 
Republicans. The existing DMC mandate gives rise to no 
legitimate concern about quotas. It merely seeks to facilitate 
equal and fair justice for all juveniles.
    The DMC mandate has resulted in many positive programming 
changes, including cultural competency training for juvenile 
justice professionals, individualized home-based-care, mentors, 
therapeutic foster care, community-based family oriented 
services, job training, increased accessibility to treatment 
services, and much more. Most importantly, the DMC mandate has 
raised the consciousness of legislators, policymakers, 
educators, law enforcement, and juvenile justice professionals 
to recognize the role of race and has enabled them to take 
positive steps to address racism in the juvenile justice 
system.
    We oppose the Republican Majority's effort to dilute the 
DMC mandate to virtual uselessness.

Deinstitutionalization of status offenders

    Before the enactment of the deinstitutionalization of 
status offenders mandate (DSO), the confinement of children who 
had committed offenses that would not be a crime if committed 
by an adult (e.g., truancy, running away, incorrigibility) was 
a national disgrace. The DSO mandate provides that juveniles 
who commit status offenses must not be held in secure detention 
or confinement. Over the past 20 years, States have moved 
dramatically from a punishment-oriented, institution-dominated 
approach to a treatment-oriented, community-based approach. 
From 1974 to 1993, the number of status offenders held in 
delinquency institutions dropped from roughly 172,000 to 3,200.
    Without merit, H.R. 3876 would allow States to hold 
juvenile status offenders in secure confinement for purposes of 
reuniting such status offenders with their parents or legal 
guardians. This misguided movement back to an institution-based 
approach is inconsistent with studies showing that nearly all 
runaways leave home for understandable reasons such as flight 
from physical and sexual abuse, and neglect. These studies 
conclude that in many cases, the youth is better off with as 
little contact as possible with family members; in other cases, 
a family must receive counseling and other social services 
before their child may be returned home safely. Therefore, we 
are appalled that the Republican Majority would suggest further 
punishing an already abused youth by first confining that youth 
indefinitely, and then reuniting that youth with a troubled 
family.
    Detention would expose these vulnerable children to more 
serious offenders and unnecessarily bring them deeper into the 
juvenile justice system. Status offenders need supervision and 
services, not detention. A major justification for the DSO 
mandate is to ensure that status offenders do not suffer the 
brunt of the juvenile justice system, particularly its sanction 
of secure confinement. The proposed modification to that 
mandate undermines the safety of children.

         h.r. 3976 would hamper the effectiveness of the ojjdp

    The Majority's legislation further vitiates the Act by 
prohibiting the Office of Juvenile Justice & Delinquency 
Prevention (OJJDP) from issuing regulations regarding the core 
mandates. Additionally, H.R. 3876 prohibits OJJDP from 
monitoring or evaluating compliance with the mandates if a 
State simply has laws on its books that mirror the mandates.
    We object to the elimination of OJJDP's ability to regulate 
and to monitor compliance with the mandates. Relaxing OJJDP's 
monitoring authority is particularly dangerous in light of 
Majority's effort to weaken the core mandates. Weakened 
mandates necessitate strong OJJDP monitoring so that States do 
not simply ignore the mandates altogether. OJJDP's authority to 
hold State's accountable for compliance with the mandates has 
led to nearly a 95% reduction of violations, although thousands 
of children are still detained improperly each year, and 
compliance with the DMC remains a challenge for 46 States.
    The combination of weakened mandates and relaxed 
accountability will turn back the clock on 20 years of juvenile 
justice progress. States left to their own devices do not work 
to protect children in the way the juvenile justice system was 
designed.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ In 1974, there were 85,000 juveniles detained or confined in 
institutions with adult prisoners, compared to less than 9,000 today. 
Prior to the deinstitutionalization of status offenders mandate in 
1974, there were more than 170,000 status offenders in secure 
facilities, in 1993, the number was down to 3,200. Similarly, prior to 
the jail removal mandate in 1980, there were 160,000 juveniles serving 
time in adult prisons, today there are 7,000.)

               h.r. 3876 directly attacks employee rights

    Currently, State juvenile justice and youth services 
workers are provided basic labor protections under the Act. 
Specifically, the Act provides that employees shall be treated 
in a fair and equitable manner and that there shall be no 
diminution of employment rights, including the continuation of 
collective bargaining rights. The longstanding protection does 
not grant any new rights or benefits to workers, but merely 
provides that taxpayer funds will not be used to undermine 
existing labor standards
    Without a shred of credible justification, H.R. 3876 
arbitrarily eliminates these protections. Our colleague 
Representative Robert Andrews (D-NJ) offered an amendment to 
retain this existing protection for men and women who perform 
very difficult and often emotional work with our nation's most 
troubled children. During consideration of the Andrews 
amendment, Republican Committee Members expressed deep 
confusion and dissatisfaction with these existing protections. 
In fact, one of our Republican colleagues remarked that the 
Act's labor protections must have been ``put in as someone's 
unusual idea 20 years ago.'' Repeatedly, we asked our 
Republican colleagues to cite any complaint that has been 
brought to their attention by a State or local official 
regarding the purported onerousness of these protections. Not 
one example was offered. We also note that at no time during 
the four recent hearings concerning the Act's reauthorization 
was any testimony provided concerning these provisions.
    We can only conclude that the Majority's motivation for 
trying to strike labor protections for workers in juvenile 
justice facilities arises from the harsh anti-labor animus that 
has been a defining characteristic of the Republican-led 104th 
Congress. It is terribly disappointing to us that consideration 
of the Andrews amendment resulted in a total breakdown of 
normal legislative procedures for markup of this legislation. 
The anti-labor provision in H.R. 3876 was misguided and 
misplaced. The Committee should have been permitted to consider 
amendments that both Democrats and Republicans wanted to offer 
to perfect H.R. 3876. We were denied that opportunity, indeed 
that right, because the abrupt conclusion of the markup was 
driven by apparent anger at our attempt to keep a wholly 
irrelevant anti-labor provision out of this bill.

             ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF REPRESENTATIVE TIM ROEMER

    On August 2, 1996, the Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee reported the Juvenile Crime and 
Delinquency Prevention Act (H.R. 3876) by a vote of 23-2. This 
important piece of legislation, which would amend and 
reauthorize current juvenile justice programs, is scheduled to 
expire on September 30, 1996.
    This critical legislation will directly impact State and 
local efforts to combat the growing problem of juvenile crime. 
Although H.R. 3876 had some serious flaws, such as the repeal 
of basic labor protections for workers in juvenile detention 
facilities, it clearly had the potential of being a bipartisan 
effort to design a comprehensive system to reduce and prevent 
criminal offenses by youth. Many Members on the Economic and 
Educational Opportunities worked very hard to draft amendments 
to improve the legislation. However, due to the Majority's 
decision to circumvent the democratic legislative process and 
prevent Democrats from offering their amendments, it turned out 
to be a partisan vote.
    The process used by the Majority on Committee to prevent 
consideration of the Democratic and Republican amendments was 
an outright assault of the integrity of the legislative 
process. More importantly, however, it is our nation's young 
people who will suffer from the procedural tactics by the 
majority. Blocking the thoughtful deliberation of legislation 
to present and reduce juvenile crime was not only unfair to the 
Democratic Members of the Committee, but also represents a 
grave injustice for American families, schools, and 
communities.

                                                        Tim Roemer.
