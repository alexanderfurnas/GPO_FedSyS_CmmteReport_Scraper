                          Purpose and Summary

    H.R. 3632 amends Title XIX of the Social Security Act to 
repeal the requirement for an annual resident review for 
nursing facilities under the Medicaid Program and to require 
resident reviews for mentally ill or mentally retarded 
residents when there is a significant change in their physical 
or mental condition.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

    Since its enactment as part of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987), the quality assurance 
standards for nursing home facilities have periodically been 
amended because of the complexity of the underlying statute and 
to correct for the unintended consequences caused by the 
implementation of the statutory provisions. One of the 
requirements of the Act was an annual resident assessment for 
all Medicaid nursing home residents. The underlying statute 
also has as a requirement in Section 1919(e)(7)(B) (i) and (ii) 
that for each resident of a nursing facility who is mentally 
ill or mentally retarded, the State mental health or mental 
retardation authority must review and determine, based on an 
independent physical and mental evaluation, whether or not the 
resident requires the level of services provided by a nursing 
facility. These annual reviews have proved to be an additional 
review, and, therefore, costly and unnecessary. The Committee, 
the States, and the Administration agree that this additional 
annual review is unnecessary.
    H.R. 3632 repeals the requirement for an annual resident 
assessment for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded. This 
bill would require, as an alternative, these additional 
resident reviews by the State mental health or mental 
retardation authority for mentally ill or mentally retarded 
residents when there is a significant change in the resident's 
physical or mental condition.

                                Hearings

    The Committee on Commerce has not held hearings on this 
specific legislation, however, this duplication was discussed 
during the overview hearings on the Reform of the Medicaid 
Program.

                        Committee Consideration

    On September 18, 1996, the Committee on Commerce met in 
open markup session and ordered H.R. 3632, a bill to amend 
Title XIX of the Social Security Act to repeal the requirement 
for annual resident review for nursing facilities under the 
Medicaid Program and to require resident reviews for mentally 
ill or mentally retarded residents when there is a significant 
change in physical or mental condition, reported to the House, 
without amendment, by a voice vote, a quorum being present.

                             Rollcall Votes

    Clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI of the Rules of the House 
requires the Committee to list the recorded votes on the motion 
to report legislation and amendments thereto. There were no 
recorded votes taken in connection with ordering H.R. 3632 
reported. A motion by Mr. Bliley to order H.R. 3632 reported to 
the House, without amendment, was agreed to by a voice vote, a 
quorum being present.

                      Committee Oversight Findings

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the Committee has not held 
oversight or legislative hearings on this legislation.

              Committee on Government Reform and Oversight

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(D) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, no oversight findings have been 
submitted to the Committee by the Committee on Government 
Reform and Oversight.

               New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(B) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee states 
that H.R. 3632 would result in no new or increased budget 
authority or tax expenditures or revenues.

                        Committee Cost Estimate

    The Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate prepared 
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                  Congressional Budget Office Estimate

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the following is the cost 
estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant 
to section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:
                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 18, 1996.
Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.,
Chairman, Committee on Commerce,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 3632 as ordered reported by the Committee on 
Commerce on September 18, 1996. The bill would repeal the 
requirement for annual resident review for nursing facilities 
under the Medicaid program and would require resident reviews 
for mentally ill or mentally retarded residents only when there 
is a significant change in their physical or mental condition. 
Pay-as-you-go procedures would apply because the bill would 
affect administrative costs of the Medicaid program, which are 
direct spending.
    Pre-admission screening and annual resident review 
requirements (PASARR) for nursing facility residents were 
enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1987. CBO estimates the repeal of the requirement for annual 
resident review for mentally retarded and mentally ill nursing 
facility residents would reduce Medicaid administrative costs 
by $8.5 million annually, about one-quarter of the total 
federal expenses of implementing PASARR.
    This bill contains no intergovernmental or private sector 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would save states $3.5 million annually 
in Medicaid payments.
    If you wish for further details on this estimate, we would 
be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Robin 
Rudowitz, who can be reached at 226-9010.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee finds that H.R. 3632 
would have no inflationary impact.

                      Advisory Committee Statement

    No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act are created by this 
legislation.

             Section-by-Section Analysis of the Legislation

Section 1. Repeal of requirement for annual resident review for 
        mentally ill and mentally retarded nursing facility residents

    Section 1 repeals the requirement under the Medicaid 
program for an annual resident review for mentally ill and 
mentally retarded residents who reside in nursing facilities. 
These amendments become effective on the date of enactment of 
this Act.

Section 2. Requirement for review in case of significant change in 
        physical or mental condition of mentally ill or mentally 
        retarded nursing facility residents

    Section 2(a) requires that a nursing facility shall 
promptly notify the State mental health authority or State 
mental retardation or developmental disability authority, as 
applicable, after a significant change in the physical or 
mental condition of a resident who is mentally ill or mentally 
retarded.
    Section 2(b) adds a new requirement that an assessment 
review must be conducted promptly after a nursing facility has 
notified the appropriate State authority that there has been a 
significant change in a resident's physical or mental 
condition.
