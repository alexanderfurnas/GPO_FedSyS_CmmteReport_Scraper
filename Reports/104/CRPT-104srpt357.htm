                               I. Purpose

    The Leahy-Kyl-Grassley amendment to the National 
Information Infrastructure (NII) Protection Act, S. 982, would 
strengthen the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. 1030, by 
closing gaps in the law to protect better the confidentiality, 
integrity, and security of computer data and networks.

                        II. Legislative History

    The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was originally enacted in 
1984 to provide a clear statement of proscribed activity 
concerning computers to the law enforcement community, those 
who own and operate computers and those tempted to commit 
crimes by unauthorized access to computers. Rather than having 
to ``boot-strap'' enforcement efforts against computer crime by 
relying on statutory restrictions designed for other offenses, 
the Computer Fraud and Abuse statute, 18 U.S.C. 1030, set forth 
in a single statute computer-related offenses. This first 
Federal computer crime statute made it a felony to access 
classified information in a computer without authorization and 
a misdemeanor to access financial records or credit histories 
in financial institutions or to trespass into a Government 
computer.
    In succeeding years, the statute has been significantly 
amended only twice, in 1986 and 1994. In its current form, this 
statute generally prohibits the unauthorized use of computers 
to obtain classified or private financial record information, 
to trespass in Federal Government computers, to commit frauds, 
or to transmit harmful computer viruses. It also prohibits 
fraudulent trafficking in computer access passwords.
    Gaps in coverage remain under this statutory scheme. 
Specifically, the law provides criminal penalties for persons 
who, without or in excess of authorization, access any computer 
to obtain classified information or financial record 
information from a financial institution or consumer reporting 
agency, or who access a ``Federal interest computer'' to 
further an intended fraud. A ``Federal interest computer'' is 
defined to include Federal Government and financial institution 
computers and computers located in different States that are 
``used in committing the offense.''
    The privacy protection coverage of the statute has two 
significant gaps. First, omitted from the statute's coverage is 
information on any civilian or State and local government 
computers, since the prohibition on unauthorized computer 
access to obtain nonclassified information extends only to 
computers used by financial institutions or by the Federal 
Government when the perpetrator is an outsider. The second gap 
is the significant limitation on the privacy protection given 
to information held on Federal Government computers. 
Specifically, the prohibition only applies to outsiders who 
gain unauthorized access to Federal Government computers, and 
not to Government employees who abuse their computer access 
privileges to obtain Government information that may be 
sensitive and confidential.
    Likewise, omitted from the fraud protection coverage of the 
statute is protection for the loss of computer time resulting 
from computer trespasses. The 1986 amendments to the statute 
created the ``computer use'' exception to section 1030(a)(4), 
even though this Committee ``agree[d] that lost computer time 
resulting form repeated or sustained trespasses can reach a 
level of seriousness sufficient to warrant Federal 
prosecution.'' Senate Judiciary Committee report No. 99-432, 
99th Cong., 2d sess., at p. 10 (1986). At the time of the 1986 
amendments, such fraudulent computer usage was considered 
prosecutable under another section 1030(a)(5), when the lost 
computer time resulted from intentional damage to the computer.
    The current statute also penalizes any person who uses a 
computer in interstate commerce or communications to cause the 
transmission of a computer virus or other harmful computer 
program. Omitted from the coverage of this ``computer damage'' 
provision are Government and financial institution computers 
not used in interstate communications, such as intrastate local 
area networks used by Government agencies that contain 
sensitive and confidential information. Also omitted are 
computers used in foreign communications or commerce, despite 
the fact that hackers are often foreign-based. For example, the 
1994 intrusion into the Rome Laboratory at Grifess Air Force 
Base in New York, was perpetrated by a 16-year-old hacker in 
the United Kingdom. More recently, in March 1996, the Justice 
Department tracked down a young Argentinean man who had broken 
into Harvard University's computers from Buenos Aires and used 
those computers as a staging ground to hack into many other 
computer sites, including the Defense Department and NASA.
    On June 29, 1995, Senators Kyl, Leahy, and Grassley 
introduced the NII Protection Act, S. 982. At hearings in both 
the House of Representatives and the Senate, representatives 
from Federal law enforcement agencies expressed the need for, 
and their support of, this bill. Specifically, Attorney General 
Janet Reno discussed the provisions of S. 982 in her October 
30, 1995, responses to written questions in connection with the 
June 27, 1995, Judiciary Committee oversight hearing of the 
Department of Justice; Federal Bureau of Investigation Director 
Louis Freeh testified about S. 982 during the February 28, 
1996, joint hearing with the Select Committee on Intelligence 
and the Judiciary Committee on economic espionage; and U.S. 
Secret Service Deputy Assistant Director of Investigations 
Robert Rasor testified about S. 982 during the October 11, 
1995, hearing of the House Committee on Banking and Financial 
Services Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary 
Policy.
    As intended when the law was originally enacted, the 
Computer Fraud and Abuse statute facilitates addressing in a 
single statute the problem of computer crime, rather than 
identifying and amending every potentially applicable statute 
affected by advances in computer technology. As computers 
continue to proliferate in businesses and homes, and new forms 
of computer crimes emerge, Congress must remain vigilant to 
ensure that the Computer Fraud and Abuse statute is up-to-date 
and provides law enforcement with the necessary legal framework 
to fight computer crime. The NII Protection Act will likely not 
represent the last amendment to this statute, but is necessary 
and constructive legislation to deal with the current increase 
in computer crime.

                         III. Committee Action

    On June 13, 1996, the Committee on the Judiciary first 
considered the NII Protection Act, S. 982, as an amendment made 
by Senators Leahy, Kyl, and Grassley to H.R. 1533, a bill to 
amend title 18, United States Code, to increase the penalty for 
escaping from a Federal prison. At that time, with a quorum 
present, by voice vote, the Committee unanimously accepted the 
Leahy-Kyl-Grassley amendment to H.R. 1533, and unanimously 
ordered H.R. 1533, so amended, favorably reported.
    On August 1, 1996, the Committee on the Judiciary, with a 
quorum present, again accepted an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute to S. 982 offered by Senator Leahy, on behalf of 
himself and Senators Kyl and Grassley. The amendment included 
the provisions in the S. 982, as introduced, with one 
modification. As discussed in more detail below, the amendment 
inserted the word ``nonpublic'' before ``computer of a 
department or agency'' in section 2(1)(C)(I) of the bill. The 
Leahy-Kyl-Grassley amendment was accepted by voice vote, and 
the Committee, also by voice vote, then unanimously ordered S. 
982, as amended, favorably reported.

                    IV. Section-by-Section Analysis

             detailed discussion of the nii protection act

    The bill amends five of the prohibited acts in, and adds a 
new prohibited act to, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a). Each of the amended 
provisions is discussed below.

(1) Amendments and addition to prohibited acts

            (A) Subsection 1030(a)(1)--Protection of classified 
                    government information
    The bill would bring the protection for classified national 
defense or foreign relations information maintained on 
computers in line with our other espionage laws. Section 
1030(a)(1) currently provides that anyone who knowingly 
accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized 
access and obtains classified information ``with the intent or 
reason to believe that such information so obtained is to be 
used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage of 
any foreign nation'' is subject to a fine or imprisonment for 
not more than 10 years for a first offense. This scienter 
element apparently was originally included because it is 
contained in 18 U.S.C. 794(a). Section 794(a), however, 
provides for life imprisonment, whereas section 1030(a)(1) 
provides for only a 10-year term of imprisonment. Therefore, 
the NII Protection Act would amend section 1030(a)(1) to track 
the scienter requirement of 18 U.S.C. 793(e), which also 
provides a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for 
obtaining from any source certain items relating to the 
national defense.
    As amended, section 1030(a)(1) prohibits anyone from 
knowingly accessing a computer, without, or in excess of, 
authorization, and obtaining classified national defense, 
foreign relations information, or restricted data under the 
Atomic Energy Act, with reason to believe the information could 
be used to the injury of the United States or the advantage of 
a foreign country, and willfully communicating, delivering or 
transmitting, or causing the same, or willfully retaining the 
information and failing to deliver it to the appropriate 
Government agent. The amendment specifically covers the conduct 
of a person who deliberately breaks into a computer without 
authority, or an insider who exceeds authorized access, and 
thereby obtains classified information and then communicates 
the information to another person, or retains it without 
delivering it to the proper authorities.
    Although there is considerable overlap between 18 U.S.C. 
793(e) and section 1030(a)(1), as amended by the NII Protection 
Act, the two statutes would not reach exactly the same conduct. 
Section 1030(a)(1) would target those persons who deliberately 
break into a computer to obtain properly classified Government 
secrets then try to peddle those secrets to others, including 
foreign governments. In other words, unlike existing espionage 
laws prohibiting the theft and peddling of Government secrets 
to foreign agents, section 1030(a)(1) would require proof that 
the individual knowingly used a computer without authority, or 
in excess of authority, for the purpose of obtaining classified 
information. In this sense then, it is the use of the computer 
which is being proscribed, not the unauthorized possession of, 
access to, or control over the classified information itself.
            (B) Subsection 1030(a)(2)--Protection of financial, 
                    Government and other computer information
    The bill would amend section 1030(a)(2) to increase 
protection for the privacy and confidentiality of computer 
information. Section 1030(a)(2) currently gives special 
protection only to information on the computer systems of 
financial institutions and consumer reporting agencies, because 
of their significance to our country's economy and the privacy 
of our citizens. Yet, increasingly computer systems provide the 
vital backbone to many other industries, such as 
transportation, power supply systems, and telecommunications. 
The bill would amend section 1030(a)(2) and extend its coverage 
to information held on (1) Federal Government computers and (2) 
computers used in interstate or foreign commerce on 
communications, if the conduct involved an interstate or 
foreign communication.
    As amended, section 1030(a)(2) would penalize those who 
intentionally access computers without, or in excess of, 
authorization to obtain government information and, where 
appropriate, information held on private computers.
    ``Information'' as used in this subsection includes 
information stored in intangible form. Moreover, the term 
``obtaining information'' includes merely reading it. There is 
no requirement that the information be copied or transported. 
This is critically important because, in an electronic 
environment, information can be ``stolen'' without asportation, 
and the original usually remains intact. This interpretation of 
``obtaining information'' is consistent with congressional 
intent expressed as follows in connection with 1986 amendments 
to the Computer Fraud and Abuse statute:

          Because the premise of this subsection is privacy 
        protection, the Committee wishes to make clear that 
        `obtaining information' in this context includes mere 
        observation of the data. Actual asportation, in the 
        sense of physically removing the date from its original 
        location or transcribing the data, need not be proved 
        in order to establish a violation of this subsection.

Senate Judiciary Committee report No. 99-432, 99th Cong., 2d 
sess., at pp. 6-7 (1986).

    The proposed subsection 1030(a)(2)(C) is intended to 
protect against the interstate or foreign theft of information 
by computer. This information, stored electronically, is 
intangible, and it has been held that the theft of such 
information cannot be charged under more traditional criminal 
statutes such as Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property, 
18 U.S.C. 2314. See United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301, 1308 
(10th Cir. 1991). This subsection would ensure that the theft 
of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computer 
is prohibited in the same way theft of physical items are 
protected. In instances where the information stolen is also 
copyrighted, the theft may implicate certain rights under the 
copyright laws. The crux of the offense under subsection 
1030(a)(2)(C), however, is the abuse of a computer to obtain 
the information.
    The seriousness of a breach in confidentiality depends, in 
considerable part, on the value of the information taken, or on 
what is planned for the information after it is obtained. Thus, 
the statutory penalties are structured to provide that 
obtaining information of minimal value is only a misdemeanor, 
but obtaining valuable information, or misusing information in 
other more serious ways, is a felony.
    The sentencing scheme for section 1030(a)(2) is part of a 
broader effort to ensure that sentences for section 1030 
violations adequately reflect the nature of the offense. Thus, 
under the bill, the harshest penalties are reserved for those 
who obtain classified information that could be used to injure 
the United States or assist a foreign state. Those who 
improperly use computers to obtain other types of information--
such as financial records, nonclassified Government 
information, and information of nominal value from private 
individuals or companies--face only misdemeanor penalties, 
unless the information is used for commercial advantage, 
private financial gain or to commit any criminal or tortious 
act.
    For example, individuals who intentionally break into, or 
abuse their authority to use, a computer and thereby obtain 
information of minimal value of $5,000 or less, would be 
subject to a misdemeanor penalty. The crime becomes a felony if 
the offense was committed for purposes of commercial advantage 
or private financial gain, for the purpose of committing any 
criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or 
laws of the United States or of any State, or if the value of 
the information obtained exceeds $5,000.
    The terms ``for purposes of commercial advantage or private 
financial gain'' and ``for the purpose of committing any 
criminal or tortious act'' are taken from the copyright statute 
(17 U.S.C. 506(a)) and the wiretap statute (18 U.S.C. 
2511(1)(d)), respectively, and are intended to have the same 
meaning as in those statutes.
    Some conduct may violate more than one subsection of 
section 1030(a)(2). For example, a particular Government 
computer might be covered by both sections 1030(a)(2)(B) and 
(a)(2)(C). This overlap serves to eliminate legal issues that 
may arise if the provisions were mutually exclusive. 
Conceivably, in a given case, it may not be clear whether 
information taken from a Government contractor's computer 
constitutes ``information from any department or agency of the 
United States'' under section 1030(a)(2)(B), but the offense 
might still be chargeable under section 1030(a)(2)(C) if the 
elements of that subsection are satisfied. Similarly, there may 
be some overlap between section 1030(a)(2) and 18 U.S.C. 641 
(relating to the theft and conversion of public money, records 
or property), but the former does not preempt the latter.
            (C) Subsection 1030(a)(3)--Protection for Government 
                    computer systems
    The NII Protection Act would make three modifications to 
subsection 1030(a)(3), which is focused on providing protection 
to Federal Government computers from outside hackers. This 
provision currently prohibits a person from intentionally 
accessing, without authorization, a Federal Government computer 
and, if the computer is not exclusively used by the Government, 
then the conduct must ``adversely affect[] the use of the 
Government's operation of such computer.''
    First, the bill would delete the word ``adversely'' because 
this term suggests, inappropriately, that trespassing in a 
computer used by the Federal Government, even if not 
exclusively, may be benign. Second, the bill would modify 
``computer of a department or agency of the United States'' 
with the term ``non-public.'' This would make clear that 
unauthorized access is barred to any ``non-public'' Federal 
Government computer and that a person who is permitted to 
access publicly available Government computers, for example, 
via an agency's World Wide Web site, may still be convicted 
under (a)(3) for accessing without authority any nonpublic 
Federal Government computer. Finally, the phrase ``the use of 
the Government's operation of such computer'' would be 
clarified with the term ``that use.'' When a computer is used 
for the Government, the Government is not necessarily the 
operator, and the old phrase may lead to confusion. Consistent 
with this change, a similar change is made by the NII 
Protection Act in the reference to government and financial 
institution computers in the new definition of ``protected 
computer'' in section 1030(e)(2)(A).
            (D) Subsection 1030(a)(4)--Increased penalties for 
                    significant unauthorized use of computers
    The bill amends 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(4) to ensure that 
sanctions apply when the fraudulent use of a computer without, 
or in excess of, authority is significant. The current statute 
penalizes, with fines and up to 5 years' imprisonment, 
knowingly accessing a computer with the intent to defraud and 
by means of such conduct furthering the fraud and obtaining 
anything of value. This provision contains a ``computer use'' 
exception that exempts fraudulent conduct to obtain only the 
use of the computer. While every trespass in a computer should 
not be converted into a felony scheme to defraud, a blanket 
exception for ``computer use'' is too broad. Hackers, for 
example, have broken into Cray supercomputers for the purpose 
of running password cracking programs, sometimes amassing 
computer time worth far more than $5,000. In light of the large 
expense to the victim caused by some of these trespassing 
incidents, the amendment would limit the ``computer use'' 
exception to cases where the stolen computer use involved less 
than $5,000 during any one-year period.
            (E) Subsection 1030(a)(5)--Protection from damage to 
                    computers
    The bill amends subsection 1030 (a)(5) to further protect 
computers and computer systems covered by the statute from 
damage both by outsiders, who gain access to a computer without 
authorization, and by insiders, who intentionally damage a 
computer. The law currently protects computers or computer 
systems from damage caused by either outside hackers or 
malicious insiders ``through means of a computer used in 
interstate commerce or communications.''
    Senator Leahy was the principal sponsor of the 1994 
amendment to subsection 1030(a)(5), which was intended to 
broaden the reach of the provision by replacing the term 
``federal interest computer'' with the term ``computer used in 
interstate commerce or communication.'' The latter term is 
broader because the definition of ``federal interest computer'' 
in section 1030(e)(2)(B) covers a computer ``which is one of 
two or more computers used in committing the offense, not all 
of which are located in the same State.'' This meant that 
hackers who attacked other computers in their own State were 
not subject to Federal jurisdiction, notwithstanding the fact 
that their actions may have severely affected interstate or 
foreign commerce. For example, individuals who attack telephone 
switches may disrupt interstate and foreign calls. The 1994 
change remedied that defect.
    The definition of Federal interest computer, however, 
actually covered more than simply interstate activity. More 
specifically, section 1030(e)(2)(A) covered, generically, 
computers belonging to the U.S. Government or financial 
institutions, or those used by such entities on a nonexclusive 
basis if the conduct constituting the offense affected the 
Government's operation or the financial institution's operation 
of such computer. By changing section 1030(a)(5) from ``federal 
interest computer'' to ``computer used in interstate commerce 
or communication'' in the 1994 amendment, Congress 
inadvertently eliminated Federal protection for those 
Government and financial institution computers not used in 
interstate communications. For example, the integrity and 
availability of classified information contained in an 
intrastate local area network may not have been protected under 
the 1994 version of section 1030(a)(5), although its 
confidentiality continued to be protected under section 
1030(a)(1).
    Thus, the current provision falls short of protecting 
government and financial institution computers from intrusive 
codes, such as computer ``viruses'' or ``worms.'' Generally, 
hacker intrusions that inject ``worms'' or ``viruses'' into a 
government or financial institution computer system which is 
not used in interstate communications is not a Federal offense. 
The NII Protection Act would change that limitation and extend 
Federal protection from intentionally damaging viruses to 
government and financial institution computers, even if they 
are not used in interstate communications.
    Specifically, as amended, subsection 1030(a)(5)(A) would 
penalize, with a fine and up to 5 years' imprisonment, anyone 
who knowingly causes the transmission of a program, 
information, code or command and intentionally causes damage to 
a protected computer. This would cover anyone who intentionally 
damages a computer, regardless of whether they were an outsider 
or an insider otherwise authorized to access the computer. 
Subsection 1030(a)(5)(B) would penalize, with a fine and up to 
5 years' imprisonment, anyone who intentionally accesses a 
protected computer without authorization and, as a result of 
that trespass, recklessly causes damage. This would cover 
outsiders hackers into a computer who recklessly cause damage. 
Finally, subsection 1030(a)(5)(C) would impose a misdemeanor 
penalty, of a fine and up to 1 year imprisonment, for 
intentionally accessing a protected computer without 
authorization and, as a result of that trespass, causing 
damage. This would cover outside hackers into a computer who 
negligently or accidentally cause damage.
    In sum, under the bill, insiders, who are authorized to 
access a computer, face criminal liability only if they intend 
to cause damage to the computer, not for recklessly or 
negligently causing damage. By contrast, outside hackers who 
break into a computer could be punished for any intentional, 
reckless, or other damage they cause by their trespass.
    The rationale for this difference in treatment deserves 
explanation. Although those who intentionally damage a system, 
without authority, should be punished regardless of whether 
they are authorized users, it is equally clear that anyone who 
knowingly invades a system without authority and causes 
significant loss to the victim should be punished as well, even 
when the damage caused is not intentional. In such cases, it is 
the intentional act of trespass that makes the conduct 
criminal. To provide otherwise is to openly invite hackers to 
break into computer systems, safe in the knowledge that no 
matter how much damage they cause, it is no crime unless that 
damage was either intentional or reckless. Rather than send 
such a dangerous message (and deny victims any relief), it is 
better to ensure that section 1030(a)(5) criminalizes all 
computer trespass, as well as intentional damage by insiders, 
albeit at different levels of severity.
    The 1994 amendment required both ``damage'' and ``loss,'' 
but it is not always clear what constitutes ``damage.'' For 
example, intruders often alter existing log-on programs so that 
user passwords are copied to a file which the hackers can 
retrieve later. After retrieving the newly created password 
file, the intruder restores the altered log-on file to its 
original condition. Arguably, in such a situation, neither the 
computer nor its information is damaged. Nonetheless, this 
conduct allows the intruder to accumulate valid user passwords 
to the system, requires all system users to change their 
passwords, and requires the system administrator to devote 
resources to resecuring the system. Thus, although there is 
arguably no ``damage,'' the victim does suffer ``loss.'' If the 
loss to the victim meets the required monetary threshold, the 
conduct should be criminal, and the victim should be entitled 
to relief.
    The bill therefore defines ``damage'' in new subsection 
1030(e)(8), with a focus on the harm that the law seeks to 
prevent. As in the past, the term ``damage'' will require 
either significant financial losses under section 
1030(e)(8)(A), or potential impact on medical treatment under 
section 1030(e)(8)(B). The bill addresses two other concerns: 
causing physical injury to any person under new section 
1030(e)(8)(C), and threatening the public health or safety 
under new section 1030(e)(8)(D). As the NII and other network 
infrastructures continue to grow, computers will increasingly 
be used for access to critical services such as emergency 
response systems and air traffic control, and will be critical 
to other systems which we cannot yet anticipate. Thus, the 
definition of ``damage'' is amended to be sufficiently broad to 
encompass the types of harm against which people should be 
protected.
    The bill also amends the civil penalty provision under 
section 1030(g) to be consistent with the amendments to section 
1030(a)(5). The amendment to section 1030(g) provides that 
victims of computer abuse can maintain a civil action against 
the violator to obtain compensatory damages, injunctive relief, 
or other equitable relief. Damages are limited to economic 
damages, unless the defendant violated section 1030(a)(5)(A) or 
section 1030(a)(5)(B); that is, unless the actor intentionally 
caused damage, or recklessly caused damage while trespassing in 
a computer.
            (F) Subsection 1030(a)(7)--Protection from threats directed 
                    against computers
    The bill would add a new subsection (a)(7) to section 1030 
to address a new and emerging problem of computer-age 
blackmail. This is a high-tech variation on old fashioned 
extortion. According to the Department of Justice, threats have 
been made against computer systems in several instances. One 
can imagine situations in which hackers penetrate a system, 
encrypt a database and then demand money for the decoding key. 
This new provision would ensure law enforcement's ability to 
prosecute modern-day blackmailers, who threaten to harm or shut 
down computer networks unless their extortion demands are met.
    The Attorney General explained in written responses to 
questions of Senator Leahy on October 30, 1995:

          These cases, although similar in some ways to other 
        cases involving extortionate threats directed against 
        persons or property, can be different from traditional 
        extortion cases in certain respects. It is not entirely 
        clear that existing extortion statutes, which protect 
        against physical injury to person or property, will 
        cover intangible computerized information.

    For example, the ``property'' protected under existing 
laws, such as the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. 1951 (interference with 
commerce by extortion), or 18 U.S.C. 875(d) (interstate 
communication of threat to injure the property of another), 
does not clearly include the operation of a computer, the data 
or programs stored in a computer or its peripheral equipment, 
or the decoding keys to encrypted data.
    New section 1030(a)(7) would close this gap in the law and 
provide penalties for the interstate or international 
transmission of threats directed against computers and computer 
systems. This covers any interstate or international 
transmission of threats against computers, computer networks, 
and their data and programs whether the threat is received by 
mail, a telephone call, electronic mail, or through a 
computerized messaging service. Unlawful threats could include 
interference in any way with the normal operation of the 
computer or system in question, such as denying access to 
authorized users, erasing or corrupting data or programs, 
slowing down the operation of the computer or system, or 
encrypting data and then demanding money for the key.

(2) Subsection 1030(c)--Increased penalties for recidivists and other 
        sentencing changes

    The bill amends 18 U.S.C. 1030(c) to increase penalties for 
those who have previously violated any subsection of section 
1030(a). The current statute subjects recidivists to enhanced 
penalties only if they violated the same subsection twice. For 
example, a person who violates the current statute by 
committing fraud by computer under subsection 1030(a)(4) and 
later commits another computer crime offense by intentionally 
destroying medical records under subsection 1030(a)(5), is not 
treated as a recidivist because his conduct violated two 
separate subsections of section 1030. The amendment provides 
that anyone who is convicted twice of committing a computer 
offense under subsection 1030(a) would be subjected to enhanced 
penalties.
    The penalty provisions in section 1030(c) are also changed 
to reflect modifications to the prohibited acts, as discussed 
above.

(3) Subsection 1030(d)--Jurisdiction of Secret Service

    The bill amends subsection 1030(d) to grant the U.S. Secret 
Service authority to investigate offenses only under 
subsections (a)(2) (A) and (B), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5) and 
(a)(6). The current statute grants the Secret Service authority 
to investigate any offense under section 1030, subject to 
agreement between the Attorney General and the Secretary of the 
Treasury. The new crimes proposed in the bill, however, do not 
fall under the Secret Service's traditional jurisdiction. 
Specifically, proposed subsection 1030(a)(2)(C) addresses gaps 
in 18 U.S.C. 2314 (interstate transportation of stolen 
property), and proposed section 1030(a)(7) addresses gaps in 18 
U.S.C. 1951 (the Hobbs Act) and 875 (interstate threats). These 
statutes are within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, which should retain exclusive jurisdiction over 
these types of offenses, even when they are committed by 
computer.

(4) Subsection 1030(e)--New definitions

    The NII Protection Act strikes the current definition of 
``Federal interest computer'' and adds new definitions for 
``protected computer,'' ``damage,'' and ``government entity.''
    The bill would amend subsection 1030(e)(2) by replacing the 
term ``Federal interest computer'' with the new term 
``protected computer'' and a new definition. The new definition 
of ``protected computer'' would modify the current description 
in subsection 1030(e)(2)(A) of computers used by financial 
institutions or the U.S. Government, to make clear that if the 
computers are not exclusively used by those entities, the 
computers are protected if the offending conduct affects the 
use by or for a financial institution or the Government. The 
new definition also replaces the current limitation in 
subsection 1030(e)(2)(B) of ``Federal interest computer'' being 
``one of two or more computers used in committing the offense, 
not all of which are located in the same State.'' Instead, 
``protected computer'' would include computers ``used in 
interstate or foreign commerce or communications.'' Thus, 
hackers who steal information or computer usage from computers 
in their own State would be subject to this law, under amended 
section 1030(a)(4), if the requisite damage threshold is met 
and the computer is used in interstate commerce or foreign 
commerce or communications.
    The term ``damage'' in new subsection 1030(e)(8), as used 
in the proposed amendment of subsection 1030(a)(5), would mean 
any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, 
information, program or system which (A) causes loss of more 
than $5,000 during any 1-year period; (B) modifies or impairs 
the medical examination, diagnosis or treatment of a person; 
(C) causes physical injury to any person; or (D) threatens the 
public health or safety.
    The term ``government entity'' in new subsection 
1030(e)(9), as used in the new proposed subsection 1030(a)(7), 
would be defined to include the U.S. Government, any State or 
political subdivision thereof, any foreign country, and any 
state, provincial, municipal, or other political subdivision of 
a foreign country.

(5) Subsection 1030(g)--Civil actions

    The bill amends the civil penalty provision in subsection 
1030(g) to reflect the proposed changes in subsection 
1030(a)(5). The 1994 amendments to the act authorized certain 
victims of computer abuse to maintain civil actions against 
violators to obtain compensatory damages, injunctive relief, or 
other equitable relief, with damages limited to economic 
damages, unless the violator modified or impaired the medical 
examination, diagnosis or treatment of a person.
    Under the bill, damages recoverable in civil actions by 
victims of computer abuse would be limited to economic losses 
for violations causing losses of $5,000 or more during any 1-
year period. No limit on damages would be imposed for 
violations that modified or impaired the medical examination, 
diagnosis or treatment of a person; caused physical injury to 
any person; or threatened the public health or safety.

                     V. Regulatory Impact Statement

    Pursuant to paragraph 11(b), rule XXVI of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate, the Committee, after due consideration, 
concludes that Senate bill 982 will not have direct regulatory 
impact.

                           VI. Cost Estimate

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                    Washington, DC, August 6, 1996.
Hon. Orin G. Hatch,
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 982, the National 
Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996, as reported 
by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on August 2, 1996.
    Enacting S. 982 could affect direct spending and receipts. 
Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to this bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                             (For June E. O'Neill).

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: S. 982.
    2. Bill title: National Information Infrastructure 
Protection Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary on August 2, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: S. 982 would make various amendments to 
the laws that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and 
security of computer systems and the information maintained on 
such systems. In particular, the bill would amend existing 
statutes relating to five computer-related crimes and would add 
a new statute making the interstate transmission of threats 
directed against computers or computer systems a federal crime.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates 
that enacting S. 982 would not have any significant budgetary 
impact. Although the legislation could affect direct spending 
and receipts, we estimate that any such changes would be 
negligible.
    6. Basis of estimate: Based on information from the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission, CBO expects that enacting S. 982 could 
increase the number of prosecutions brought by the federal 
government and could increase governmental receipts from 
penalties for committing computer-related crimes. Fewer than 50 
persons are convicted of existing computer-related crimes each 
year and CBO does not expect that the caseload under S. 982 
would increase significantly. Thus, CBO estimates that the 
Justice Department would not need significant additional 
resources to enforce the provisions of the bill.
    Furthermore, CBO estimates that any increase in prison time 
served by people prosecuted under the statutes affected by S. 
982 would be negligible and that the government would collect 
less than $500,000 a year in additional fines. Such fines are 
recorded in the budget as governmental receipts, deposited in 
the Crime Victims Fund, and spent in the following year. 
Because the increase in direct spending would be the same as 
the amount of fines collected with a one-year lag, the 
additional direct spending also would be less than $500,000 a 
year.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets 
up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct 
spending or receipts through 1998. S. 982 would establish new 
fines and increase some existing ones. CBO expects that any 
additional receipts would be negligible and thus the pay-as-
you-go impact of this bill, as shown in the following table, 
also would be negligible.

                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 1996     1997     1998 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change in outlays............................        0        0        0
Change in receipts...........................        0        0        0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: S. 982 contains no intergovernmental mandates as 
defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 
104-4) and would not impose costs on State, local, or tribal 
governments.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would 
impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: On July 25, 1996, CBO 
transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 1533, the Sexual Offender 
Tracking and Identification Act of 1996, as reported by the 
Senate Committee on the Judiciary on June 13, 1996. Section 13 
of H.R. 1533 is identical to S. 982. The other provisions of 
H.R. 1533, as approved by the Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary, were not included in S. 982.
    11. Estimate prepared by: Federal cost estimate: Susanne S. 
Mehlman and Stephanie Weiner. Impact on State, local, and 
tribal governments: Leo Lex. Impact on the private sector: 
Matthew Eyles.
    12. Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine (for Paul N. 
Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis).

                      VII. Changes in Existing Law
