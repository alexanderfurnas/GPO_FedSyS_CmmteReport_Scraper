                                       150),

                                Managers on the Part of the Senate.
       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3675) making 
appropriations for the Department of Transportation and related 
agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for 
other purposes, submit the following joint statement to the 
House of Representatives and the Senate in explanation of the 
effect of the action agreed upon by the managers and 
recommended in the accompanying conference report.

                        congressional directives

      The conferees agree that Executive Branch propensities 
cannot substitute for Congress' own statements concerning the 
best evidence of Congressional intentions; that is, the 
official reports of the Congress. Report language included by 
the House that is not changed by the report of the Senate, and 
Senate report language that is not changed by the conference is 
approved by the committee of conference. The statement of the 
managers, while repeating some report language for emphasis, is 
not intended to negate the language referred to above unless 
expressly provided herein.

                     program, project and activity

      During fiscal year 1997, for the purposes of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 
99-177), as amended, with respect to funds provided for the 
Department of Transportation and related agencies, the terms 
``program, project and activity'' shall mean any item for which 
a dollar amount is contained in an appropriations Act 
(including joint resolutions providing continuing 
appropriations) or accompanying reports of the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations, or accompanying conference 
reports and joint explanatory statements of the committee of 
conference. In addition, the reductions made pursuant to any 
sequestration order to funds appropriated for ``Federal 
Aviation Administration, facilities and equipment'' and for 
``Coast Guard, Acquisition, construction, and improvements'' 
shall be applied equally to each ``budget item'' that is listed 
under said accounts in the budget justifications submitted to 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations as modified 
by subsequent appropriations Acts and accompanying committee 
reports, conference reports, or joint explanatory statements of 
the committee of conference. The conferees recognize that 
adjustments to the above allocations may be required due to 
changing program requirements or priorities. The conferees 
expect any such adjustment, if required, to be accomplished 
only through the normal reprogramming process.

                staffing increases provided by congress

      The conferees direct the Department of Transportation to 
fill expeditiously any positions added in this bill, without 
regard to agency-specific staffing targets which may have been 
previously established to meet the mandated government-wide 
staffing reductions. The conferees support the overall staffing 
reductions, and have made reductions in the bill which more 
than offset staffing increases provided for a small number of 
specific activities.

                 TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

                        Office of the Secretary

                         salaries and expenses

      Amendment No. 1: Appropriates $52,966,000 for salaries 
and expenses of the office of the secretary, instead of 
$53,816,000 as proposed by the House and $53,376,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes the following changes 
to the budget request for this office:

Reductions in staff:
    -2 public affairs specialists                              -$150,000
    -2 attorney advisors                                        -200,000
    -1 staff assistant, immediate office of the deputy 
      secretary                                                  -60,000
    -5 procurement analysts, office of acquisition            -1,000,000
Information technology and support......................      -1,000,000

      Child safety seats.--The conferees understand that no 
less than six entities within the department may be involved in 
child safety seat design and that there may be little, if any, 
departmental oversight of this activity. Therefore, within 
sixty days after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
designate one person within the office of the Secretary to the 
role of coordinating child safety seat design and report to 
both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations the 
individual assigned to this position and a timetable to resolve 
key design issues.
      Amendment No. 2: Includes language as proposed by the 
Senate that provides such sums as necessary to investigate 
anti-competitive practices in air transportation. The House 
bill contained no similar provision.

           transportation planning, research, and development

      The conferees are concerned that throughout the United 
States rising costs and fragmentation of regional bus systems 
may have significant financial and service implications. 
Nowhere is this more evident than in the national capital 
region. Accordingly, within the $3,000,000 appropriated for 
transportation planning, research, and development activities, 
the conferees direct the Secretary of Transportation to make 
available sufficient resources to the Washington Metropolitan 
Area Transit Authority to commission an independent study to 
analyze how to meet current and future bus transportation needs 
for the greater Washington metropolitan region through the year 
2020. The report is to be submitted to both the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations by September 30, 1997.
      The conference agreement includes $100,000 to continue 
the department's ongoing analysis of impacts on the United 
States and Mexico related to motor carrier impacts of the North 
America Free Trade Agreement.

                        payments to air carriers

                (liquidation of contract authorization)

                    (airport and airway trust fund)

            (including rescission of contract authorization)

      Amendment No. 3: Appropriates $25,900,000 to liquidate 
contract authority obligations for payments to air carriers as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by 
the House.
      Amendment No. 4: Limits obligations for payments to air 
carriers to $25,900,000 as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$10,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      Amendment No. 5: Rescinds $12,700,000 in contract 
authority from the payments to air carriers program as proposed 
by the Senate instead of $28,600,000 as proposed by the House. 
The conference agreement rescinds contract authority that is 
not available for obligation due to annual limits on 
obligations.

                            rental payments

      Amendment No. 6: Appropriates $127,447,000 for rental 
payments as proposed by the House instead of $129,500,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 7: Provides $17,294,000 in rental payments 
from ``Federal-aid highways, Limitation on general operating 
expenses'' as proposed by the House instead of $17,192,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.

                              Coast Guard

                           operating expenses

      Amendment No. 8: Appropriates $2,319,725,000 for Coast 
Guard operating expenses instead of $2,609,100,000 as proposed 
by the House and $2,331,350,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement assumes that an additional $300,000,000 
will be provided in the Department of Defense Appropriations 
Act, 1997 for Coast Guard support of national security 
missions, as assumed in the Senate bill.
      The following table summarizes the budget estimate, House 
and Senate recommendations, and the conference agreement by 
budget activity:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

      The conference agreement includes the following 
adjustments to the budget estimate:

Pay and Allowances:
    Bonuses and awards..................................         -$3,000
Operations and Support:
    Maintenance and logistics commands..................        -413,000
    District offices....................................      -2,726,000
    Ammunition and small arms...........................      -2,000,000
Recruiting and Training Support:
    Professional training and education.................      -2,000,000
Coast Guard-Wide Centralized Services:
    FTS-2000............................................        -179,000
Account-Wide Adjustments:
    Miscellaneous supplies..............................     -2,5000,000
    Boat safety administration-offset...................        -304,000
    Non-operational travel..............................      -1,000,000
    General reduction...................................      -7,000,000

      Reprogramming violations.--In last year's action, the 
appropriations conferees expressed concern over the Coast 
Guard's misinterpretation and violation of the existing 
Congressional reprogramming guidelines, and requested the 
Office of the Secretary to redistribute the guidelines to each 
operating administration. Despite this action, however, the 
Coast Guard reprogrammed millions of dollars for streamlining 
activities without specific Congressional concurrence, and 
submitted a reprogramming request after the fact. The conferees 
are very concerned about these continued breaches in the Coast 
Guard's application of appropriated funds, and hope that by the 
time of next year's appropriations hearings, the Coast Guard 
can develop a system of internal controls which assure the 
Congress that this pattern of frequent violations will no 
longer occur.
      Abandoned barges, Houston, TX.--The conferees agree to 
provide $1,5000,000 for Coast Guard removal of abandoned barges 
in the Houston ship channel and the San Jacinto River, and the 
Coast Guard is directed to use such funds only for that 
purpose. The House bill included $2,000,000 for this purpose.
      Marine fire and safety association.--The conferees agree 
to provide $297,000 for the marine fire and safety association 
for fire fighting and oilspill response contingency plans on 
the Columbia River.
      Drug interdiction activities.--The conferees do not agree 
to the House's allocation of funding for specific drug 
interdiction activities based on Coast Guard statements that 
this allocation was based on incomplete and outdated 
information. However, the conferees urge the Coast Guard to 
allocate their drug interdiction resources, to the extent 
possible, in a manner consistent with directives of the 
Congress in the authorization process.
      Air Station Chicago.--The conferees understand that the 
Coast Guard has proposed to relocate Air Station Chicago--
currently located in Glenview, Illinois--to Muskegon, Michigan 
and that budgetary considerations played a significant role in 
this decision. The conferees understand the need for the Coast 
Guard to relocate from Glenview in light of that facility's 
location at a military installation slated for closure and 
redevelopment pursuant to the Base Closure Act, and also 
understand the need for the Coast Guard to conserve budgetary 
resources. The conferees further note that the proposed 
relocation is in compliance with the directive accompanying the 
fiscal year 1996 appropriation, which directed the Coast Guard 
to maintain a presence in southern Lake Michigan. However, in 
light of concerns regarding the search and rescue response time 
from Muskegon to points in southern Lake Michigan, the 
conferees request that, prior to undertaking this proposed 
relocation, the Coast Guard provide to the House and Senate 
Transportation Appropriations Subcommittees data demonstrating 
that the relocation will not adversely affect boating safety in 
the southern Lake Michigan area.

              acquisition, construction, and improvements

      Amendment No. 9: Appropriates $374,840,000 for 
Acquisition, construction, and improvements instead of 
$358,000,000 as proposed by the House and $393,100,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      A table showing the distribution of this appropriation by 
project as included in the fiscal year 1997 budget estimate, 
House bill, Senate bill, and the conference agreement follows:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

      Amendment No. 10: Provides $216,500,000 to acquire, 
repair, renovate, or improve vessels, small boats and related 
equipment instead of $205,600,000 as proposed by the House and 
$227,960,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 11: Provides $18,040,000 to acquire new 
aircraft and increase aviation capability instead of 
$18,300,000 as proposed by the House and $19,040,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 12: Provides $41,700,000 for the equipment 
instead of $39,900,000 as proposed by the House and $46,200,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 13: Provides $52,350,000 for shore 
facilities and aids to navigation facilities instead of 
$47,950,000 as proposed by the House and $52,900,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 14: Provides $46,250,000 for personnel 
compensation and benefits as proposed by the House instead of 
$47,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. This provides an 
increase of 3.5 percent above the fiscal year 1996 enacted 
level.
      Amendment No. 15: Deletes language proposed by the House 
which would require the disposal of Coast Guard property 
located in Wildwood, New Jersey in a manner resulting in saving 
during fiscal year 1997 of $20,000,000. The conferees 
understand that other federal agencies are interested in this 
property, and GSA property disposal procedures in such cases 
make any savings unlikely.
      Amendment No. 16: Includes House prohibition of funds for 
continuing the Vessel Traffic Services 2000 program, and 
allocates $1,000,000 for a study of available technical 
solutions which minimize complexity and cost in any follow-on 
VTS programs, as director in the Senate report.
      The conferees are disappointed that, up to this point, 
the Coast Guard has been unable to develop a compromise 
position between the desires of the agency for the relatively 
high-tech, expensive VTS 2000 system and the needs of local 
port communities for affordable vessel traffic services. The 
Coast Guard is still unable to present the Congress with a firm 
cost estimate or siting plan for VTS 2000 systems, and has not 
resolved the issue of who will ultimately pay the operating 
costs of the system. Recent reviews of the program by the U.S. 
General Accounting Office and the National Academy of Sciences 
did not endorse this program as currently structured. Given the 
questions of support and concerns about which entities will pay 
to operate the system, the conferees agree that the presently 
configured VTS 2000 program should be ended.
      However, the need for state-of-the-art vessel traffic 
services remains in some ports, especially New Orleans, which 
was the lead port for the VTS 2000 concept. Although these 
requirements have existed for many years, the safety benefits 
of such systems have been delayed while the Coast Guard 
conducted lengthy studies and the program experienced internal 
budget reduction. Under the current schedule, many ports would 
not receive VTS capability for another seven to ten years.
      The conferees can no longer accept further Coast Guard 
delays in delivering the safety benefits of vessel traffic 
systems to critical ports around the country, particularly 
since, as the VTS 2000 schedule slipped and costs rose, systems 
have been developed and fielded by private industry which 
satisfy many of the ports' VTS requirements. The conferees 
firmly believe that, with greater user involvement and a 
dedication to truly off-the-shelf technology, the Coast Guard 
can and should implement VTS services at critical ports such as 
New Orleans more quickly than the ten year implementation 
schedule of VTS 2000. To move forward with this new effort, the 
conference agreement provides $1,000,000 for the Coast Guard to 
identify minimum user requirements for new VTS systems in 
consultation with local officials, waterway users, and port 
authorities. This study should also review user fee options and 
private/public partnerships.
      The conferees hope that, at the end of fiscal year 1997, 
the Coast Guard will be able to propose a viable new production 
program, supported by local communities, which will provide 
near-term safety benefits. The conferees also agree to leave 
any unobligated VTS 2000 funds in place to support this follow-
on effort. The House had proposed a rescission of those funds, 
as described under amendment numbered 17.

              acquisition, construction, and improvements

                             (rescissions)

      Amendment No. 17: Deletes rescissions totaling $3,755,000 
proposed by the House. The conference agreement allows any 
unobligated funds to be used for follow-on activities, as 
previously described, but not for VTS 2000. The Coast Guard 
should consider these funds as having been reprogrammed.

                environmental compliance and restoration

      Amendment No. 18: Appropriates $22,000,000 for 
Environmental compliance and restoration instead of $21,000,000 
as proposed by the House and $23,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conference agreement includes the following 
breakdown of funds:

Site-specific cleanup and restoration projects..........     $15,000,000
Environmental compliance................................       2,800,000
Personnel...............................................       4,200,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Total.............................................      22,000,000

      The conferees recognize that funding for specific 
projects will have to be adjusted to reflect the reduced 
appropriation level. The Coast Guard is accorded the discretion 
to allocate such reductions without triggering the formal 
reprogramming process.

                        port safety development

      Amendment No. 19: Appropriates $5,000,000 for debt 
retirement of the Port of Portland, Oregon as proposed by the 
Senate, and makes a technical change to the language proposed. 
The House bill included no similar appropriation.

                         alteration of bridges

      Amendment No. 20: Appropriates $16,000,000 for Alteration 
of obstructive bridges as proposed by the House instead of 
$10,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees agree that 
these funds should be allocated as described in the House 
report.

               research, development, test and evaluation

      Amendment No. 21: Appropriates $19,200,000 for Research, 
development, test and evaluation instead of $19,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $19,550,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The conferees agree to the following adjustments to the 
budget estimate:

Ship Structure Committee; Support for committee.........       -$214,000
Servicewide Safety and Environmental Compliance: 
    Pollution prevention................................        -200,000
Command, Control, Computers and Intelligence: Advanced 
    communications systems..............................         -86,000
Technology Base:........................................
    Future technology assessment........................        -200,000
    Select projects.....................................        -400,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Net adjustment....................................      -1,100,000

                              boat safety

      Amendment No. 22: Appropriates $35,000,000 as proposed by 
the House instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conferees agree that this safety program should be fully funded 
at the authorized level. The Senate level assumed the enactment 
of new authorizing legislation which would make the boat safety 
program a mandatory appropriation, and which is strongly 
opposed by the House appropriations conferees.

                    federal aviation administration

                               operations

      Amendment No. 23: Appropriates $4,900,000,000 for 
operations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as 
proposed by the House instead of $4,899,957,000 as proposed by 
the Senate. This appropriation represents an increase of 
$254,288,000 (five percent) above the fiscal year 1996 
appropriation, and is sufficient to support the hiring of 500 
new air traffic controllers, 367 new aviation safety inspectors 
and other regulatory oversight personnel, and an increase of 
8.9 percent in funding for field maintenance of air traffic 
control equipment.
      The following table summarizes the House and Senate 
recommendations and the conference agreement by budget 
activity:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

      Sanford-Lee County, NC airport.--The conference agreement 
includes no site-specific earmarks, either direct or implied, 
for particular airport projects. However, the conferees urge 
the FAA administrator to give expeditious consideration to 
accelerated construction of the new Sanford-Lee County Airport 
in North Carolina, in the hope that the project can be 
completed as quickly as possible.
      Lancaster, PA airport.--The conference agreement includes 
no site-specific earmarks, either direct or implied, for 
particular airport projects. However, the conferees urge the 
FAA administrator to give the environmental assessment for a 
proposed runway at Lancaster Airport in Pennsylvania 
expeditious consideration, in the hope that the project can be 
completed as quickly as possible.
      Williamsport-Lycoming County, PA airport.--The conferees 
commend to the FAA's attention the growing need for a runway 
extension project at the Williamsport-Lycoming County, PA 
Airport. The conferees note that the primary runway is 
currently 6,449 feet long. If it is extended to 7,000 feet, 
there would be opportunities for improved safety, larger 
aircraft, and regional air freight service, which would 
contribute significantly to economic development. Accordingly, 
the conferees urge FAA to give expeditious consideration to the 
environmental assessment of the Williamsport-Lycoming Airport's 
proposed runway extension project.
      ASOS/contract weather observers.--The conferees are aware 
of the significant concerns of air traffic controllers that 
funds in the President's budget are not adequate to meet the 
requirement for contract weather observations. In response, the 
FAA has developed a plan to supplement those observations with 
additional activities required of air traffic controllers. The 
conferees agree that controllers are not optimally trained to 
make precise weather observations, and such activities impinge 
on their other important safety duties. Therefore, the 
conference agreement provides an additional $1,000,000 for 
contract weather observers at the highest priority sites.
      ASOS/EL Paso International Airport.--The conferees 
reiterate strong concern expressed in the House report over the 
reliability of weather reporting performed by the automated 
surface observing system (ASOS) in the absence of contract 
weather observers at the El Paso International Airport. The 
conferees urge the FAA to move expeditiously to reinstate 
contract weather observation activities at this facility.
      Aviation security.--The conference agreement provides 
$72,872,000 for aviation security activities, an increase of 
$951,000 above the budget estimate. Given the heightened 
security posture at domestic airports and the need for greater 
attention in some areas, the conferees believe additional 
resources are warranted at this time.
      Administration of airports.--The conferees agree to 
provide $43,250,000 for this activity, as proposed by the 
Senate. The FAA administrator is granted the flexibility to 
allocate the reduction in this program.
      Cargo security program.--The conference agreement 
provides $10,500,000 for an expanded cargo security program, in 
light of a recent aviation accident investigation calling into 
question the effectiveness of current activities in this area. 
The Senate bill includes $9,950,000 for this effort, consistent 
with a budget amendment received in July 1996. The conferees 
have information indicating that the higher level of funding is 
needed for this program due to more recent budget estimates. 
Given the priority of this program and its impact on aviation 
safety, the conferees are providing these funds even though 
difficult reductions are required in other areas of the budget.
      Mid-America Aviation Resource Consortium.--The conferees 
expect the FAA to continue the agency's commitment to the Mid-
America Aviation Resource Consortium (MARC) in Minnesota, and 
have included $1,700,000 in the bill for this purpose. These 
funds are to be used in Minnesota to support the air traffic 
controller training program and to continue research for the 
FAA, curriculum development, follow-up on MARC graduates, and 
to develop other materials as needed for FAA-related projects. 
The conferees also direct the FAA to release these funds to 
MARC not less than thirty days after enactment of this Act.
      The conferees further expect the FAA to develop a long-
term plan for training en route controllers. The conferees also 
expect the FAA to develop long-term projections for air traffic 
controllers needed to safely maintain our air traffic control 
system. The conferees are very disappointed in the FAA's lack 
of long-term planning as it relates to both air traffic control 
training and controller needs. MARC has a successful track 
record at placing students directly in the field, and the 
conferees both support and encourage this cost-effective manner 
of training.
      Amendment No. 24: Provides that, of the total amount 
provided, $1,642,500,000 shall be derived from the airport and 
airway trust fund as proposed by the House instead of 
$2,742,602,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conference 
agreement provides the maximum amount allowable under existing 
authorization guidelines. According to the FAA, this level of 
trust fund spending, combined with other amounts in the bill, 
should be sufficient to support FAA programs without 
interruption until approximately September 1997, assuming 
current aviation taxes on passenger tickets, jet fuel, cargo 
waybills, and other items are not extended beyond the date in 
current law (December 31, 1996). However, the conferees wish to 
point out that the current situation results once again in 
general fund taxpayers subsidizing the aviation system in this 
country far beyond the benefits they receive.
      Amendment No. 25: Provides that $75,000,000 in new user 
fees may be established by the FAA, as proposed by the Senate, 
instead of $30,000,000 as proposed by the House. The 
President's budget requested $150,000,000 in new fees. As shown 
in amendment numbered 27, the conference agreement stipulates 
that the only new fee authorized is an ``overflight'' fee, for 
services provided to aircraft which traverse U.S.-controlled 
airspace without taking off from, or landing in, the United 
States. The FAA estimates that, were such collections to begin 
immediately in the fiscal year, approximately $109,000,000 
could be collected. The conference agreement accepts the fee on 
a trial basis, and the lower level allows implementation to 
begin later in the fiscal year to allow a longer review and 
consultation process with affected parties.
      The conferees accept that some additional user fees may 
be necessary to accommodate the rising operational costs of the 
agency. However, there is still great concern that any fee 
proposed be able to meet the test of a user fee, and not be a 
tax. The FAA is currently developing an improved cost 
accounting system which may improve the credibility of user 
fees proposed in future years. The conferees support the 
continued development of this system as a vital tool in 
evaluating future user fee requests. In addition, the conferees 
believe that aviation user fees, where they are successful 
around the world, involve significant advance consultation with 
those parties paying the fee, as well as detailed accounting 
for, and explanation of, costs being incurred by the agency. 
Given the relative ease with which user fees can be raised, the 
existence of a strong, two-way consultation process is 
essential for controlled agency costs and maintaining political 
consensus for such a system. Should expansion of the user fee 
concept be proposed in future years, the conferees will 
consider whether a well-formulated consultation process has 
been developed in concert with the specific fee schedules.
      Amendment No. 26: Provides a final general fund share of 
the overall appropriation estimated at $3,182,500,000 instead 
of $2,127,398,000 as proposed by the House and $2,082,355,000 
as proposed by the Senate. This figure is the total 
appropriation minus offsetting collections from additional user 
fees and minus the share of total expenses derived from the 
Airport and Airway Trust Fund.
      Amendment No. 27: Provides that the only additional user 
fees authorized as offsetting collections are ``overflight'' 
fees, as proposed by the House. The Senate bill contained no 
similar provision.

                        facilities and equipment

                    (airport and airway trust fund)

      Amendment No. 28: Appropriates $1,790,000,000 for 
Facilities and equipment instead of $1,800,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $1,788,700,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The following table summarizes the fiscal year 1997 
budget estimate, House and Senate recommended levels, and the 
conference agreement by budget activity:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

      Automated surface observing system (ASOS).--The 
conference agreement includes $10,000,000 specifically for the 
FAA to acquire 55 new automated surface observing system (ASOS) 
units; $1,275,000 for ASOS units in Alaska that still await 
commissioning; and $1,369,000 for activities included in the 
President's budget request. Given the budgetary shortfalls in 
this program, the conferees direct the FAA not to reprogram 
these funds to other purposes.
      Hazardous materials management.--The conferees direct the 
FAA to give high priority to hazardous materials issues at the 
FAA Technical Center in New Jersey out of the $15,000,000 
provided.
      Runway incursion technologies.--Last year, the Congress 
provided $2,000,000 for loop technology and surface detection 
to assist in runway incursion reduction. The conferees direct 
the department to report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations by November 30, 1996 regarding the status of 
this funding and development of a prototype system.
      Amendment No. 29: Specifies that $1,573,000 of the total 
amount provided shall be available for three years, instead of 
$1,583,000,000 as proposed by the House and $1,571,700,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. This is the total appropriation for 
budget activities one through four.

                 research, engineering, and development

                    (airport and airway trust fund)

      Amendment No. 30: Appropriates $187,412,000 for Research, 
engineering, and development instead of $185,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $188,490,000 as proposed by the 
Senate. The following table summarizes the fiscal year 1997 
budget estimate, House and Senate recommended levels, and the 
conference agreement:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

      Weather.--The conference agreement provides $13,000,000, 
as proposed by the House, for research to improve aviation 
safety under hazardous weather conditions. The amount provided 
shall include the following specific allocations for projects 
described in the House and Senate reports:

Windshear/downdraft research, Juneau, AK................        $400,000
Project SOCRATES........................................       1,589,000
National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).........       4,600,000

      National Center for Atmospheric Research.--The conference 
agreement includes $4,600,000 specifically for aviation weather 
research and related activities coordinated by the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and assisted by the 
NOAA's Forecast Systems Laboratory, the National Severe Storms 
Laboratory, and other organizations. The conferees consider 
this work to be of high priority, and direct the FAA not to use 
these funds for in-house staffing or to reprogram any of these 
funds to other purposes. The FAA is requested to report to the 
House and Senate Committees on Appropriations by December 31, 
1996 detailing the specific activities to be financed with 
these funds and the expected obligation dates.
      The conferees are disappointed that the FAA is not 
placing a higher priority on aviation weather safety research, 
and is not yet taking a leadership role in this area, as 
recommended recently by the National Academy of Sciences. The 
conferees urge the FAA to develop a more vigorous and effective 
program of weather research beginning with the fiscal year 1998 
budget request.
      System security technology.--The conference agreement 
fully funds the administration's request of $36,055,000 for 
aviation security technology, as proposed by the Senate. Within 
this amount, $27,397,000 is provided for research and 
development into new devices to detect explosives and weapons, 
and $1,361,000 is provided to harden aircraft against the 
effects of explosions.

                       GRANTS-IN-AID FOR AIRPORTS

                (LIQUIDATION OF CONTRACT AUTHORIZATION)

                    (AIRPORT AND AIRWAY TRUST FUND)

      Amendment No. 31: Limits obligations under the grants-in-
aid for airports program to $1,460,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate instead of $1,300,000,000 as proposed by the House. This 
is an increase of $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 1996 level 
and $110,000,000 above the administration's request.
      Letters of intent.--The conferees echo the Senate's 
concern with FAA's ability to estimate airport development 
projects' impact on system-wide-capacity, and therefore direct 
that FAA be granted the authority to award new letters of 
intent (LOIs) only after scheduled LOI payments fall to less 
than 50 percent of total airport improvement program (AIP) 
discretionary funds. The conferees do not agree with the 
Senate's directions that FAA enter into any new LOIs at this 
time. However, the conferees recognize the priority and need 
for capacity enhancements at our nation's airports and do not 
intend to preclude meritorious projects from receiving funds. 
The conferees encourage the FAA to award discretionary grants 
to these projects consistent with existing evaluation criteria.
      Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.--With respect to 
the Senate language regarding consideration of a possible 
letter of intent for the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, 
the conferees agree the FAA shall consider the LOI application 
from the airport subject to the completion of the required FAA/
federal environmental review process, including the issuance of 
a record of decision.
      Airport property lease/transfers.--The conferees 
recognize the important contribution that aeronautical higher 
education programs can make to the U.S. air transportation 
system. In recognition of this contribution, the conferees 
direct that non-profit, accredited universities or colleges 
offering aeronautical higher education programs desiring to 
establish or expand campus operations on airport property may 
negotiate and execute lease or purchase transactions up to, but 
no greater than, the established aeronautical use rate at the 
host airport.

                 ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FRANCHISE FUND

      Amendment No. 32: Provides for the establishment of a new 
administrative services franchise funds within the FAA, as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
provision. The conferees agree to the establishment of such a 
fund on trial basis, and will review the effectiveness and cost 
efficiency of the fund in next year's appropriations hearings.

                     Federal Highway Administration

                Limitation on General Operating Expenses

      Amendment No. 33: Limits general operating expenses of 
the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to $521,114,000, 
instead of $510,981,000 as proposed by the House and 
$534,846,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 34: Provides for the extended availability 
of $221,958,000 for contract programs of the Federal Highway 
Administration, instead of $214,698,000 as proposed by the 
House and $234,840,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The recommended funding distribution by program and 
activity of the administrative expenses and research and 
development programs of the FHWA is as follows:

      Total.............................................     122,000,000

      Office of motor carriers.--The conference agreement 
provides $49,000,000 for the office of motor carriers' 
administrative expenses within the FHWA's limitation on general 
operating expenses. The conference agreement includes the 
following adjustments to the budget request:

Outreach and education..................................       -$400,000
NAFTA implementation....................................        -200,000
Administrative expenses, including travel...............        -400,000
Exemption and waivering monitoring......................        +300,000
Commerical drivers licensing program....................        +200,000

      Pilot safety rating program.--Before February 1, 1998, 
FHWA shall develop a pilot project that would encourage those 
carriers identified as having safety or compliance problems 
through the Commercial Vehicle Information System (CVIS) to 
procure the assistance of a third party safety service to work 
with the carrier in improving safety performance during the six 
month monitoring period following the receipt of a CVIS warning 
letter. Whenever appropriate, FHWA may defer imposing civil 
penalties, consistent with the provisions of the Motor Carrier 
Safety Act of 1984, but shall not do so in those cases in which 
evidence of serious safety violations (as defined in the Motor 
Carrier Safety Act of 1990) are found. In such cases, FHWA must 
follow its existing enforcement policies. FHWA shall consider 
the assistance provided by the third party service as a 
justification to reduce any penalties as provided under 49 
U.S.C. section 521(b)(2)(C). Furthermore, the conferees 
recognize that the safety ratings assigned to motor carriers 
should be based primarily on actual performance on the highway 
(inspection and crash data), and should also take into account 
compliance with non-paperwork safety regulations, especially 
regulations identified as critical and acute.
      Highway research and development.--The conference 
agreement deletes the Senate's direction that $100,000 of the 
funds provided for highway research and development be used by 
a major national organization dedicated to grade crossing 
safety. The conference agreement has included sufficient 
resources for grade crossing safety activities under the 
Federal Railroad Administration's research and development 
account.
      Pavements.--The conference agreement includes sufficient 
resources to develop a systematic approach to expanded waste 
utilization using aging tests to ensure long-term physical and 
environmental performance of applications using a variety of 
recycled and waste materials.
      Structures.--The conference agreement provides sufficient 
resources for the research and development of composite pilings 
and the use and testing of calcium magnesium acetate as a non-
corrosive anti-icer on new concrete and metal surfaces on 
bridges in Chicago.
      Environment.--The conference agreement provides 
$14,558,000 for environmental research and development and 
includes sufficient resources to identify at the National 
Center for Physical Acoustics scientific issues which impede 
accurate noise prediction.
      Motor carrier research.--The conference agreement 
provides $7,500,000 for motor carrier research and includes 
$500,000 to develop better scientific and empirical basis for 
the out-of-service criteria and to ensure that the inspection 
process is more closely tied to crash reduction measures.
      Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) research and 
development.--The conference agreement provides $29,000,000 for 
ITS research and development. Within these funds, the conferees 
have provided $7,000,000 for commercial vehicle operations 
(CVO) research and development, including $5,100,000 for SAFER/
MCSAP sites, and $11,000,000 for crash avoidance research.
      ITS operational tests.--The conference agreement provides 
$56,000,000 for operational tests. Within these funds, the 
conferees have provided $2,000,000 for mainstreaming training 
activities and $11,900,000 for completion of the CVISN and its 
prototype testing and substantial progress on the pilot 
projects. The conferees direct that none of the funds provided 
for the CVISN project be used for evaluation purposes. In 
addition, within the funds provided for commercial vehicle 
operations, the conference agreement includes $500,000 to 
advance the concept and technology of automated compliance 
review. The conference agreement deletes the Senate directive 
that $500,000 of the funds for traffic control be used to 
support the work of a public/private coalition to address the 
institutional issues of incident management.
      ITS automated highway systems (AHS).--The conference 
agreement provides $22,000,000 for the AHS and includes funds 
to incorporate commercial vehicles into the AHS program.
      ITS evaluations.--The conference agreement provides 
$2,000,000 for ITS evaluations. The conferees agree not to 
specify a minimum on the level of resources to be used to 
analyze the costs and benefits of the CVISN prototype/pilot 
program.
      Technology assessment and deployment.--The conference 
agreement provides $13,999,000 for technology assessment and 
deployment and includes sufficient resources to conduct the 
office of highway safety's ongoing outreach activities.
      Technical assistance to Russia.--The conference agreement 
includes $200,000 to further the FHWA's ongoing technical 
assistance program to Russia.

                          Federal-Aid Highways

                      (Limitation on Obligations)

                          (Highway Trust Fund)

      Amendment No. 35: Limits obligations for the federal-aid 
highways program to $18,000,000,000 instead of $17,550,000,000 
as proposed by the House and $17,650,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conference agreement deletes the Senate references of 
priority designations and set-asides within the Federal Highway 
Administration's discretionary grant programs.
      The conferees direct that within the total provided for 
the intelligent transportation systems program, funding shall 
be available for the following projects in the amounts 
specified below:

        Project                                         Conference level

    \1\)................................................     (2,000,000)

\1\ These funds are reprogrammed from the Southern State Parkway, New 
York Inform System.

      National capital region congestion mitigation.--The 
conferees are aware of the specialized analysis and evaluations 
associated with the national capital ITS deployment and support 
the Virginia Department of Transportation's (VDOT) plan to 
allocate $500,000 of the funds made available for this 
initiative for modeling the regional impacts of a traveler 
information project. The conferees direct the FHWA, working 
with VDOT, to ensure that this analysis is conducted in a 
manner which fully identifies the impacts and benefits of the 
showcase program from a regional basis.
      Los Alamos National Laboratory.--The conferees note that 
the level of mobile source emissions is increasing in the 
United States, raising concerns about the impact of 
transportation on air quality. The conferees urge the 
department to work with Los Alamos National Laboratory on an 
integrated evaluation tool at the laboratory that combines 
advanced measurement and modeling tools with innovative policy 
approaches.
      The conferees direct that any funding provided for 
intelligent transportation systems be used only in support of, 
or for research on, intelligent transportation systems and not 
for construction of buildings in fiscal year 1997.
      The director of the joint program office shall ensure 
that the operations of each of the ITS projects funded with 
either GOE or ISTEA funds is consistent with the national 
systems architecture and the purposes of section 6053(b) of 
ISTEA. These projects shall contribute to the implementation of 
the standards development work and shall promote 
interoperability of ITS systems among the states.
      The conferees have also included sufficient funding for 
the ITS rural initiative, as proposed in the fiscal year 1997 
budget.
      The conferees support the widest possible distribution of 
all published reports resulting from the ITS program to anyone 
at reasonable costs. The director of the joint program office 
shall encourage the timely distribution of such publications in 
electronic forms through clearinghouses.
      Orange County toll road.--Any agreement entered into by 
the Secretary of Transportation under the provisions of title 
IV of this Act must specify that all construction contingency 
reserves are to be exhausted before the line of credit provided 
in that section is drawn upon; however, any other contingency 
reserves, such as environmental reserves, need not be exhausted 
and may remain in place. This provision is intended to make 
more efficient use of prior appropriations to the underlying 
project by permitting substitution of a federal line of credit 
for a portion of the project's construction reserves, but it is 
not intended to affect or involve required environmental 
reserves in any way.
      Highway Beautification Act.--The conferees are aware that 
the FHWA has announced that it is revising regulations 
governing outdoor advertising along certain federal-aid 
highways in order to reduce the complexity of these regulations 
and emphasizing the role of the states regarding effective 
control of such advertising. As part of FHWA's review of this 
issue, the FHWA shall prepare a report that discusses the 
feasibility, including necessary statutory revisions, of 
allowing a state to implement common sense exemptions to 
existing prohibitions on the posting of ``for sale'' signs 
along certain federal-aid highways if such exemptions respond 
to unique needs or issues relevant to the state. The conferees 
agree that this report shall be submitted to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations no later than January 31, 
1997.

      Amendment No. 36: Restores language proposed by the House 
and stricken by the Senate that prohibits new obligations for 
right-of-way acquisition during fiscal year 1997 and deletes 
language proposed by the Senate that would have provided 
$8,000,000 for new direct loans.

                      motor carrier safety grants

                (liquidation of contract authorization)

                          (highway trust fund)

      Amendment No. 37: Limits obligations for motor carrier 
safety grants to $78,225,000 instead of $77,425,000 as proposed 
by the House and $79,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees agree to the following program allocations:

Basic grants to states..................................     $60,000,000
Traffic enforcement.....................................       7,800,000
Hazardous materials training............................       1,500,000
Research and development................................         500,000
Public education........................................         500,000
CDL enforcement.........................................       1,000,000
Truck and bus accidents.................................       1,750,000
Uniformity grants.......................................       2,500,000
Uniformity working groups...............................         350,000
Commercial vehicle information system...................       1,500,000
Administrative expenses.................................         825,000

      Out-of-service verification activities.--The conferees 
agree that, within the basic grant program, $1,000,000 shall be 
for out-of-service verification activities, of which at least 
$500,000 shall be for new and innovative covert operations 
strategies.
      Assistance to border states.--The conferees direct that, 
within the basic grant program, $1,000,000 shall be for Mexican 
border enforcement activities instead of $750,000 as proposed 
by the House.
      Travel.--In each of the respective reports, both the 
House and Senate directed the office of motor carriers (OMC) to 
hold its federal grants conference in conjunction with the 
Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) conference because 
most inspectors and state motor vehicle personnel attend the 
CVSA conference. Combining these two conferences would be a 
wise use of scarce travel resources. However, the conferees 
understand that OMC is planning its own conference, 
disregarding House and Senate directives. The conferees again 
direct OMC to combine these two conferences as a means to 
control costs.

                       state infrastructure banks

      Amendment No. 38: Appropriates $150,000,000 from the 
general fund for the state infrastructure bank pilot program 
instead of $250,000,000 from the highway trust fund as proposed 
by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
appropriation.
      The conference agreement includes language that prohibits 
the distribution of funds provided under this Act until 180 
days after enactment to ensure that all states have sufficient 
time to submit applications for consideration.
      The conference agreement deletes the Senate's directive 
that funds be provided from the state infrastructure bank pilot 
program for the Alameda corridor project.

             National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

                        Operations and Research

      Amendment No. 29; Appropriates $80,900,000 from the 
general fund for operations and research activities of the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) instead 
of $81,895,000 as proposed by the House and $80,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.

                        Operations and Research

                          (Highway Trust Fund)

      Amendment No. 40: Appropriates $51,712,000 from the 
highway trust fund for operations and research of the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration instead of $50,377,000 as 
proposed by the House and $53,195,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conference agreement for operations and research 
(general fund and highway trust fund combined) includes the 
following adjustments to the budget request:

Safety performance:
    Vehicle safety standards............................       +$340,000

      Vehicle safety performance standards.--The conferees 
provide $929,000 for vehicle safety performance, an increase of 
$340,000 from the budget request. This additional funding 
should be used toward establishing a federal motor vehicle 
safety standard for frontal offset crash testing. The conferees 
direct NHTSA to work with interested parties, including the 
automotive industry, to develop such a standard under 
established rulemaking procedures. The conferees believe that 
such a standard will enhance automobile safety for all 
consumers. Further, these activities should reflect ongoing 
efforts to enhance international harmonization of safety 
standards. NHTSA should be prepared to provide a status report 
to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on standards 
development and harmonization with current European and 
Australian offset crash tests during the fiscal year 1998 
hearings.
      New car assessment program.--The conference agreement 
provides $2,792,000 for the new car assessment program. Funding 
is allocated in the following manner: $1,695,000 for frontal 
impact testing; $850,000 for side impact testing; and $247,000 
for promotional activities. The conferees note that there are 
substantial differences between the U.S. side impact standard 
and the new European standard. These differences are 
inconsistent with the need for the international harmonization 
of motor vehicle safety standards. Therefore, NHTSA is directed 
to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations by April 30, 1997, on the agency's plan for 
achieving harmonization of the side impact standard.
      The conferees have not funded a new frontal offset test 
as part of the NCAP program and note that there is no motor 
vehicle safety standard for this test. However, the conferees 
have provided $340,000 under the vehicle safety standard 
program for NHTSA to begin work on establishing a frontal 
offset standard.
      Vehicle domestic content labeling audit.--The conferees 
were unable to provide funding for the vehicle domestic content 
labeling audit; however, this does not prejudice the project 
from receiving consideration for funding in future 
appropriation bills.
      State and communities program evaluation.--The conferees 
have provided $100,000 to conduct a field evaluation of breath 
alcohol ignition interlock devices. Many states have been 
experimenting with programs requiring the use of these devices 
as a condition of probation or for early relicensing of 
impaired driving repeat offenders. Since the effectiveness of 
these programs is not well documented, this evaluation should, 
among other things, determine if these devices are successful 
in preventing drunk drivers from becoming repeat offenders.
      Speed enforcement.--The conference agreement provides 
$556,000 for speed and unsafe driving, including $100,000 to 
undertake a study on the effect of repealing the national speed 
limit, as required by the National Highway System Designation 
Act of 1995.
      Older driver research.--The conferees have provided 
$544,000 for older driver research, an increase of $100,000 
above the budget request. These additional funds are to be 
provided to continue activities to improve older driver 
performance, as directed by the Senate.
      Driver fatigue.--The conference agreement includes 
$1,000,000 to analyze the role of driver fatigue, sleep 
disorders, and inattention. NHTSA should collaborate directly 
with the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research to conduct 
and assess public information activities in these three areas 
and submit a report to the House and Senate Appropriations 
Committees by May 1, 1997 that describes these collaborative 
efforts.
      Child passenger safety.--The conferees direct that 
$137,000 be used for education and outreach activities to 
inform parents of potential dangers of automobile airbag 
deployment in connection with infant and child car seats. This 
effort can either be supported from appropriated funds or 
pledged contributions by a coalition of automobile 
manufacturers, air bag suppliers, insurance companies, and 
safety organizations.
      Motor vehicle services.--The conference agreement directs 
that up to $200,000 from the section 402 administrative 
takedown account shall be used to provide evaluations and 
technical assistance to states on motor vehicle services.
      Biomechanics.--The conference agreement provides 
$7,450,000 for biomechanics, of which $250,000 shall be for 
research on child safety seats and their interaction with 
airbags. This funding shall be used to conduct a comprehensive, 
interdisciplinary study involving pediatric trauma experts, 
engineers, and epidemiologists on means to prevent additional 
deaths and injuries. Research is already being conducted in 
this area by Children's Hospital in Philadelphia in conjunction 
with the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering.
      Bicycle safety.--The conferees note that children aged 5 
to 14 are the most common victims of bicycle injuries, with 
bicycling the fourth leading cause of death for that age group. 
Of the 500,000 bicycle injuries occurring in the United States 
each year, the age group 5 to 14 accounts for more than 50 
percent. To address this alarming development and the existing 
gap in research dedicated to prevention of bicycle accidents, 
the conferees urge NHSTA to provide necessary support to 
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and Carnegie--Mellon 
University for human factors research geared to utilizing 
advanced technology and medical science to investigate how 
bicycle accidents occur in the first place, and to design and 
implement a prevention program.
      International harmonization.--The conferees have provided 
$246,000 for international harmonization, as proposed by the 
House. This funding should be used to harmonize international 
research efforts, help emerging markets adopt current vehicle 
safety standards, and reduce or eliminate incompatibilities 
among various safety regulations.

                     highway traffic safety grants

                (liquidation of contract authorization)

                          (highway trust fund)

      Amendment No. 41: Appropriates $168,100,000 to liquidate 
contract authority obligations for highway traffic safety 
grants instead of $167,100,000 as proposed by the House and 
$169,100,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 42. Limits obligations for highway traffic 
safety grants to $168,100,000 instead of $167,100,000 as 
proposed by the House and $169,100,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Amendment No. 43. Provides $128,700,000 for state and 
community highway safety grants instead of $127,700,000 as 
proposed by the House and 129,700,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.

1003(a)(7) highway safety grants instead of $11,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $12,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Amendment No. 45. Provides $25,500,000 for Section 410 
alcohol-impaired driving countermeasures instead of $26,000,000 
as proposed by the House and $25,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Amendment No. 46. Provides $5,468,000 for administering 
state and community highway safety programs as proposed by the 
Senate instead of $5,268,000 as proposed by the House.

                    Federal Railroad Administration

                      office of the administrator

      Amendment No. 47. Appropriates $16,739,000 for the Office 
of the Administrator as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$16,469,000 as proposed by the House.
      Ravenna, Ohio connection.--The conferees directed the 
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to study, in conjunction 
with Amtrak, the State of Ohio, and affected freight railroads, 
the feasibility of constructing a railway connection in 
Ravenna, Ohio that would restore Amtrak service to the cities 
of Youngstown and Ravenna and provide service to New Castle, 
Pennsylvania. Of the total funds appropriated, not less than 
$200,000 shall be available to conduct this study, which should 
address, among other items, closure and safety enhancements to 
a highway-rail grade crossing located at the site. it is the 
intention of the conferees that should the $200,000 for the 
study not be fully spent, excess funds be available for 
environmental assessment of the Ravenna connection, provided 
that state and/or local funds have been pledged.
      Rail Safety Institute.--The conference agreement includes 
a general provision that permits FRA to establish a Rail Safety 
Institute and provides $200,000 from the office of the 
administrator to establish and operate this institute.
      Train whistle ban.--In implementing section 20153 of 
title 49, United States Code, the conferees encourage the 
Secretary of Transportation to document the impact on 
communities of any new requirements for the sounding of train 
whistles or horns at highway-rail grade crossings, while 
keeping in mind the paramount importance of safety. In 
exercising the statutory authority to provide for exceptions to 
the horn sounding requirement, the Secretary should consider 
the safety records of individual highway-rail grade crossings 
and provide exceptions where there is no significant history of 
loss of life or serious personal injury. The Secretary is also 
strongly encouraged to consider comprehensive local rail safety 
enforcement and public education programs as supplementary 
safety measures. Where it is determined that new physical 
supplementary safety measures are necessary, particular 
characteristics of the crossing and the views of the affected 
community should be considered. Finally, the Secretary is 
strongly encouraged to work in close partnership with 
communities affected by this law and to provide such 
communities with technical assistance.

                   railroad research and development

      Amendment No. 48. Appropriates $20,100,000 for railroad 
research and development instead of $20,341,000 as proposed by 
the House and $20,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conference agreement includes the following changes to the 
budget request:

Reductions in new program initiatives...................     $-2,725,000
Delete funding for maglev initiative....................      -1,000,000
Hold environmental program to 1996 level................        -400,000
Offset for high unobligated balances....................        -640,000
Increase Operation Lifesaver............................        +300,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Net reduction.....................................     $-4,465,000

      Mitigation study.--The conference agreement includes 
$100,000 to conduct a study on the impacts of reopening the 
Stampede Pass rail line operated by Burlington Northern-Santa 
Fe Railroad. This study shall be conducted by the FRA in 
conjunction with officials from the city of Auburn, Washington, 
which will provide local matching funds to complete the study.
      Amtrak privatization study.--The conferees encourage FRA 
to conduct a study on the privatization of intercity passenger 
rail service. Such a study may investigate the alternatives of: 
(a) a passenger system operating under the franchise of a 
public or private national coordinating authority with service 
provided by one or more private operators; (b) privatization of 
Amtrak with significant, sustainable, and stable sources of 
capital funding; and (c) federal withdrawal from all intercity 
passenger rail funding responsibility. The study should also 
quantify the costs of the Federal Government of any 
privatization options outlined above. The study should seek 
analysis and options from a variety of groups, as outlined in 
the Senate report, and should be submitted to the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations by August 1, 1997.
      Positive train control.--The conferees commend the FRA 
for its consideration of a demonstration project proposal 
involving positive train contain technologies, which would 
develop on-board locomotive train control devices that could be 
applied by railroads using a variety of technologies, and would 
be tested on the rail line between Manassas, Virginia through 
Hagerstown, Maryland to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
      Micro-superconducting magnetic energy storage.--The 
conferees have become aware of the effectiveness of micro-
superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) technology in 
preventing power outages in certain manufacturing industries 
and its potential for generating energy savings and enhancing 
safety in the railroad industry. Accordingly, the conferees 
direct the Department to report to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations by April 1, 1997 on the 
feasibility of utilizing micro-SMES technology to provide cost 
effective energy regeneration and energy savings capability 
along the northeast corridor for both Amtrak and commuter rail 
operations.

                 Northeast Corridor Improvement Program

      Amendment No. 49: Appropriates $115,000,000 for the 
Northeast Corridor Improvement Program instead of $200,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
appropriation for this program.
      North Philadelphia station.--The conferees note continued 
delays in the completion of the rehabilitation of the North 
Philadelphia train station. The conferees direct Amtrak to 
spend previously appropriated funds by September 1, 1997.

            Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Program

      Amendment No. 50: Deletes loan guarantees of $75,000,000 
and an associated appropriation of $4,158,000 for the railroad 
rehabilitation and improvement program proposed by the Senate. 
The House bill contained no similar loan guarantees or 
appropriation.

generation high-speed rail studies, corridor planning, 
development, demonstration, and implementation instead of 
$19,757,000 as proposed by the House and $26,525,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement provides total funding 
(appropriation plus contract authority remaining in the trust 
fund) of $26,178,000, to be allocated as follows:

Advanced train control:
    State of Oregon.....................................      $3,000,000

Planning technology.....................................         428,000

      Northwest high-speed rail projects.--A total of 
$8,650,000 is provided for the State of Oregon, including 
$5,650,000 for tracks, signals, and grade crossing improvements 
within the Eugene, Oregon to Vancouver, Washington segment of 
the Pacific Northwest high-speed rail corridor; and $3,000,000 
for extending the positive train separation system, modeling, 
and testing within the corridor. This will complement State and 
local investment being made in this FRA-designated high-speed 
rail corridor to achieve two hour service between Portland and 
Eugene, Oregon. No matching funds shall be required for this 
project.
      Amendment No. 52: Provides that next generation high-
speed rail funds may be made available for track and signal 
improvements as proposed by the House instead of track, signal, 
and station improvements as proposed by the Senate.

                     alaska railroad rehabilitation

      Amendment No. 53: Appropriates $10,000,000 for Alaska 
railroad rehabilitation as proposed by the Senate. The House 
bill contained no similar provision.

                     rhode island rail development

      Amendment No. 54: Appropriates $7,000,000 for the Rhode 
Island rail development project instead of $4,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $10,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Amendment No. 55: Directs the Providence and Worcester 
Railroad to reimburse Amtrak and/or the Federal Railroad 
Administration up to the first $13,000,000 in legal damages if 
damages occur resulting from provision of vertical clearances 
in excess of those required for present freight operations 
instead of $10,000,000 as proposed by the House and $16,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate.

                     direct loan financing program

      Amendment No. 56: Deletes appropriation of $58,680,000 in 
direct loan financing for the Alameda Corridor and the 
limitation on direct loans of $400,000,000 proposed by the 
House. The Senate bill contained no similar appropriation.

         grants to the national railroad passenger corporation

      Amendment No. 57: Appropriates $565,450,000 for the 
National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) instead of 
$462,000,000 as proposed by the House and $592,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Route and service changes.--On August 8, 1996, Amtrak 
announced a major restructuring plan that, among other items, 
discontinued service on certain routes beginning November, 
1996. Some of the affected states have expressed an interest in 
``buying back'' their service; however, certain legislatures 
will not convene again until 1997. These states will not have 
the ability to consider additional funding sources for these 
services before the routes are terminated. The conferees are 
aware that the department has ruled, in the past, that using 
congestion mitigation and air quality (CMAQ) improvement 
program funding for operational support for intercity rail 
service is possible, if states are willing to approve this use 
of funding. The conferees urge Amtrak, in conjunction with the 
department and the affected states, to consider the use of CMAQ 
funding in the short term to support service along terminated 
routes until state legislatures meet to decide whether to ``buy 
back'' services, or take other action necessary to permit 
services to continue.
      Amendment No. 58: Provides $223,450,000 for capital 
improvements of Amtrak instead of $120,000,000 as proposed by 
the House and $250,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                     Federal Transit Administration

                        administrative expenses

      Amendment No. 59: Appropriates $41,497,000 for 
administrative expenses of the Federal Transit Administration 
instead of $41,367,000 as proposed by the House and $42,147,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes the following 
reductions to the budget request:

Reduce amounts for organizational training..............       -$500,000
Eliminate director, office of communications and 
    external affairs and executive assistant positions..        -150,000

      The conferees have agreed to provide sufficient resources 
to hire four additional community planners.

                             formula grants

      Amendment No. 60: Appropriates $490,000,000 from the 
general fund for formula grants to the Federal Transit 
Administration as proposed by the House instead of $218,335,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 61: Provides for a total program level of 
$2,149,185,000 as proposed by the Senate, instead of 
$2,052,925,000 as proposed by the House.
      Amendment No. 62: Deletes the words ``notwithstanding any 
other provision of law'' proposed by the Senate. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.

                     transit planning and research

      The conference report includes a total of $85,500,000 for 
transit planning and research, of which $22,000,000 shall be 
available for national planning and research activities. The 
conferees direct that within the funding level provided for 
transit planning and research, the Federal Transit 
Administration shall make available the following amounts for 
the programs and activities listed below:

Hennepin community works program, Hennepin County, 
    Minnesota...........................................        $500,000
Project ACTION..........................................       2,000,000

proposed by the House. The Senate bill contained no similar 
appropriation.
      Amendment No. 75: Provides $22,500,000 for transit 
improvements in the Chicago downtown area instead of

proposed by the Senate. Improvements include, but are not 
limited to: installing a cab signal system for the State Street 
subway; renovations of the State Street subway continuous

mezzanine at the Jackson/Van Buren subway station; mezzanine 
and platform rehabilitation of the CTA Grand/State subway 
station; and design work for Ravenswood/Douglas Branch 
rehabilitation.
      Amendment No. 76: Provides $11,000,000 for the DART North 
Central light rail extension project instead of $10,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $12,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Amendment No. 77: Provides $15,250,000 for the Dallas-
Fort Worth RAILTRAN project instead of $12,500,000 as proposed 
by the House and $18,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 78: Provides $661,000 for the DeKalb 
County, Georgia light rail project, instead of $1,000,000 as 
proposed by the House. The Senate bill contained no similar 
appropriation.
      Amendment No. 79: Provides $1,500,000 for the Denver 
Southwest Corridor project, instead of $3,000,000 as proposed 
by the House. The Senate bill contained no similar 
appropriation.
      Amendment No. 80: Provides $9,000,000 for the Florida

instead of $20,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 81: Provides $1,000,000 for the Griffin

$24,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 83: Provides $5,500,000 for the Jackson, 
Mississippi Intermodal Corridor, instead of $7,400,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
appropriation.
      Amendment No. 84: Provides $15,000,000 for the 
Jacksonville ASE extension project, instead of $15,300,000 as 
proposed by the House. The Senate bill contained no similar 
appropriation. The conferees agree that this appropriation 
shall complete the Federal Government's financial participation 
in the automated skyway extension project, as authorized in 
section 3035(ww) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation 
Efficiency Act.
      Amendment No. 85: Provides $3,000,000 for the Kansas City

the House and $3,600,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 86: Provides $2,000,000 for the Little 
Rock, Arkansas Junction Bridge project instead of $6,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar

      Amendment No. 87: Provides $70,000,000 for the Los 
Angeles MOS-3 project instead of $90,000,000 as proposed by the 
House and $55,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Congress has stated clearly that airport funds should not 
be used for non-airport purposes. Moreover, the House 
Subcommittee on Transportation Appropriations has stated that 
it will consider any action to divert revenue illegally from 
airports in all its decisions regarding funding for 
transportation projects within its jurisdiction. The conferees 
are troubled by reports that the City of Los Angeles may be 
considering the illegal diversion of airport revenues to the 
city's general fund. Accordingly, the conferees direct that the 
FTA may only award up to fifty percent of the funding provided 
for the Los Angeles MOS-3 project in this Act to the Los 
Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority prior to April 1, 
1997, provided the department's inspector general (IG) 
certifies in writing that no revenue has been diverted 
illegally from the Los Angeles airports to the City of Los 
Angeles since the enactment of this Act. Similarly, no 
additional funds may be apportioned after that date unless the 
IG certifies that no illegal airport revenues diversion has 
occurred during the fiscal year. It is the intent of the 
conferees that the IG conduct an expeditious review of this 
matter so as to not unduly delay the award of funds to the 
project.
      Amendment No. 88: Provides $1,500,000 for the Los 
Angeles-San Diego commuter rail project as proposed by the 
House. The Senate bill contained no similar appropriation.
      Amendment No. 89: Provides $33,191,000 for the MARC 
Commuter Rail Improvement project instead of $27,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $50,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Amendment No. 90: Provides $1,500,000 for the Metro-Dade 
Transit east-west corridor, Florida project instead of 
$5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained 
no similar appropriation.
      Amendment No. 91: Provides $1,000,000 for the Miami-North 
27th Avenue project as proposed by the House. The Senate bill 
contained no similar appropriation.
      Amendment No. 92: Provides $3,039,000 for the Memphis, 
Tennessee Regional Rail plan instead of $2,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $6,400,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 93: Provides $4,240,000 for the Morgantown,

Indiana commuter rail project as proposed by the House. The 
Senate bill contained no similar appropriation.
      Amendment No. 98: Provides $2,000,000 for the Oklahoma 
City, MAPS corridor transit system instead of $10,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
appropriation.

      Amendment No. 100: Provides $10,000,000 for the 
Pittsburgh Airport busway project instead of $15,100,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
appropriation.
      Amendment No. 101: Provides $6,000,000 for the Portland 
South/North light rail transit project as proposed by the 
Senate. The House bill contained no similar appropriation.
      Amendment No. 102: Provides $138,000,000 for the 
Portland-Westside/Hillsboro Extension project as proposed by 
the Senate, instead of $90,000,000 as proposed by the House.
      Amendment No. 103: Provides $2,000,000 for the Research 
Triangle Park, North Carolina regional transit plan instead of 
$5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained 
no similar appropriation.
      Amendment No. 104: Provides $6,000,000 for the Sacramento

$7,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 105: Provides $35,000,000 for the Salt Lake 
City-South LRT project instead of $20,000,000 as proposed by 
the House and $58,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 106: Retains with modification House 
language stricken by the Senate relating to high-occupancy 
vehicle lane and corridor design costs. The conferees agree 
that $10,000,000 of the funds appropriated for this project may 
be available for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane and corridor 
design costs. The conferees direct FTA to review the HOV and 
corridor design costs with respect to this project and report 
back to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on 
future funding estimates of these activities prior to the 
hearings on the fiscal year 1998 budget.
      Amendment No. 107: Provides $13,500,000 for St. Louis 
Metrolink instead of $30,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
House bill contained no similar provision.
      Amendment No. 108: Provides $32,000,000 for the St. 
Louis-St. Clair Extension project instead of $20,000,000 as 
proposed by the House and $45,000,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Amendment No. 109: Provides $27,500,000 for the San 
Francisco Area-BART airport extension/San Jose Tasman West LRT 
projects instead of $35,000,000 as proposed by the House and 
$20,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Although both the House and Senate's accompanying reports 
noted the significant progress having been made by BART, each 
identified significant outstanding concerns and conditions that 
must be met prior to the issuance of a full funding grant 
agreement, and, in the Senate report, of a letter of no 
prejudice. The conferees note that the California statutory 
amendments required by the House have been enacted. The 
conferees reiterate all other conditions contained in each 
report including the sixty day notice to the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations, but have agreed to remove the 
Senate condition that all litigation be resolved prior to the 
issuance of a full funding grant agreement or a letter of no 
prejudice. The conferees note that the FTA provided an updated 
status to the House and Senate Committees on August 19, 1996; 
however, the conferees agree that this letter does not satisfy 
the requirement--nor resolve all of the concerns identified in 
the conference report accompanying the Department of 
Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 
fiscal year 1996 or the House and Senate reports accompanying 
this Act--that the FTA notify House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations sixty days prior to the issuance of a full 
funding grant agreement or letter of no prejudice that each of 
the Committees' concerns have been resolved. Such notification 
shall include detailed financial analysis to demonstrate 
compliance with 49 U.S.C. 5309(e).
      For example, the conferees understood that the FTA 
expected to approve BART's finance plan by the end of August 
and sign a full funding grant agreement by early October. The 
conferees note that BART's finance plan assumes a $200,000,000 
contribution from the San Francisco International Airport, and 
understand that the airport has now identified revenue bonds as 
its source of funds. However, under the airport's agreement 
with the airlines, it could not formally approve the bonds 
until after September 2, 1996. On July 1, 1996, the airport 
submitted its proposed financial plan to the FAA for approval. 
Upon FAA's review and certification that the airport's proposed 
financial plan is consistent with federal transportation law 
and regulations, and the approval of the airport's commission, 
the airport plans to issue revenue bonds. BART and the airport 
then expect to execute a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on 
project budget, schedule, construction, insurance, maintenance, 
and operating responsibilities. The conferees direct that the 
FTA not execute a full funding grant agreement until (1) the 
FAA reviews and certifies that the airport's financial 
contribution is consistent with federal transportation policy 
and regulations; (2) the MOU is signed; and (3) the House and 
Senate Committees on Appropriations are provided a full sixty 
days to review the project's status and notify the FTA in 
writing that its concerns have been fully resolved. Only after 
receiving such congressional notification shall the FTA enter 
into a full funding grant agreement that limits federal costs 
of the project to not more than $750,000,000, including all 
unanticipated contingencies, interest, and other financing 
costs. If, after sixty days, neither Committee (1) has notified 
the FTA that any of its concerns remain unresolved or (2) has 
informed the FTA that additional information is required in 
order for the Committee to determine whether the concerns are 
resolved, the FTA may execute a full funding grant agreement in 
accordance with the directives contained in this report. The 
conferees agree that a full funding grant agreement shall 
specifically require that BART, the project sponsors and 
financiers accept full financial responsibility for all project 
cost increases and overruns.
      Amendment No. 110: Provides $1,500,000 for the San Diego-
Mid-Coast Corridor project instead of $3,000,000 as proposed by 
the House. The Senate bill contained no similar provision.
      Amendment No. 111: Provides $4,750,000 for the San Juan 
Tren Urbano project instead of $9,500,000 as proposed by the 
House. The Senate bill contained no similar provision.
      Amendment No. 112: Provides $3,000,000 for the Seattle-
Renton-Tacoma light rail project instead of $5,000,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.
      Amendment No. 113: Provides $375,000 for the Staten 
Island-Midtown Ferry service project as proposed by the House. 
The Senate bill contained no similar provision.
      Amendment No. 114: Deletes ``and'' as proposed by the 
Senate and changes the name of the Tampa to Lakeland commuter 
rail project in the House engrossed bill to the Tampa Bay 
Regional Rail project.
      Amendment No. 115: Provides $3,000,000 for the Virginia 
Rail Express Richmond to Washington commuter rail project 
instead of $8,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The House bill 
contained no similar provision.
      Amendment No. 116: Provides $3,750,000 for the Whitehall 
ferry terminal, New York, New York, instead of $2,500,000 as 
proposed by the House and $5,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                       mass transit capital fund

                (liquidation of contract authorization)

                          (highway trust fund)

      Amendment No. 117: Appropriates $2,300,000,000 to 
liquidate contract authority obligations for mass transit 
capital programs as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$2,000,000,000 as proposed by the House.

             washington metropolitan area transit authority

      Amendment No. 118: Appropriates $200,000,000 for 
construction of the Washington, D.C. metrorail system as 
proposed by the House instead of $198,510,000 as proposed by 
the Senate.

             Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation

                       operations and maintenance

                    (harbor maintenance trust fund)

      Amendment No. 119: Appropriates $10,337,000 for 
operations and maintenance of the Saint Lawrence Seaway 
Development Corporation as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$10,037,000 as proposed by the House.
      Performance-based organization report.--In July, 1996, 
the Department of Transportation proposed legislation to 
restructure the Seaway into a performance-based organization 
(PBO). Given the late date of the legislation and the dramatic 
impact of establishing the Seaway Corporation as a PBO, neither 
the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations nor the 
appropriate authorizing committees have had sufficient 
opportunity to review the proposal.
      The conferees direct the General Accounting Office to 
submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, the House Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee, and the Senate Commerce Committee evaluating the 
performance-based organization concept, with a specific 
emphasis on the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. 
This report shall address financing mechanisms, accountability, 
Congressional oversight, management structure, regional 
impacts, and safety concerns, and shall be provided to the 
committees by May 15, 1997.

              Research and Special Programs Administration

                     research and special programs

      Amendment No. 120: Appropriates $26,886,000 for research 
and special programs instead of $23,929,000 as proposed by the 
House and $27,675,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement distributes the research and 
special programs appropriation and 197 full-time equivalent 
staff positions as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    Amount     Positions
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hazardous materials safety.....................   $15,472,000        131
Research and technology........................     3,580,000         13
Emergency transportation.......................       993,000          7
Program support................................     6,841,000         46
------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The conference agreement includes the following 
adjustments to the budget request:

Hazardous materials safety:
    Personnel, compensation and benefits................     +$1,111,000
    Operating expenses..................................        +569,000
    Information systems.................................        +125,000
    Research and analysis...............................        +315,000
    Hazmat training.....................................        +225,000
    Information dissemination...........................        +315,000
Research and technology:
    Operating expenses..................................         -17,000
    Technology development..............................      -3,908,000
    Technology applications.............................        -600,000

      Hazardous materials safety positions.--The conferees 
provide the Administrator with the discretion to transfer up to 
two hazmat safety positions and $200,000 into program support.
      Hazardous materials rulemaking.--The conferees understand 
that the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is 
currently evaluating comments received in relation to a 
proposal intended to achieve uniformity and streamline the 
application and enforcement of federal hazardous materials 
regulations. As currently drafted, the proposed regulations may 
add thousands of dollars annually in increased compliance costs 
to farmers and agribusinesses without improving safety. The 
conferees strongly encourage RSPA to give serious consideration 
to establishing an agriculture exemption consistent with 
similar exemptions already granted by the department.

                            pipeline safety

                         (pipeline safety fund)

      Amendment No. 121: Appropriates $30,988,000 for pipeline 
safety as proposed by the House instead of $31,278,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 122: Provides $28,460,000 from the pipeline 
safety fund as proposed by the House instead of $28,750,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement includes the 
following reductions from the budget request:

Operating expenses......................................       -$383,000
Information systems.....................................        -290,000
Training and information dissemination..................         -67,000
Research and development................................        -500,000
Grants..................................................      -1,800,000
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    ____________________________________________________
      Total reduction...................................      -3,040,000

                      Office of Inspector General

                         salaries and expenses

      Amendment No. 123: Appropriates $37,900,000 for salaries 
and expenses of the office of inspector general instead of 
$39,450,000 as proposed by the House and $39,700,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The conference agreement reflects the 
reduction of $1,900,000 for contract audits, as described in 
amendment numbered 124.
      Amendment No. 124: Provides that none of the funds 
provided for the office of inspector general may be used for 
contract audits, as proposed by the House. The Senate bill 
included $1,900,000 for contract audits. The conferees agree 
with the House's position that such audits should be paid for 
by the operating administrations, and not by the Inspector 
General. This is consistent with recommendations made by OMB in 
its December 3, 1992 Interagency Task Force Report on the 
Federal Contract Audit Process, and would require those 
agencies receiving the direct benefit of the service to pay for 
it. Since the IG will no longer be providing funds for these 
audits, the results from the application of those funds should 
no longer be included in the IG's semi-annual reports to the 
Congress. In addition, the conferees agree that the office of 
inspector general should continue to serve in a coordinating 
role between the operating administrations and the Defense 
Contract Audit Agency, in order to streamline the 
administration of this process.

                      Surface Transportation Board

                         salaries and expenses

      Amendment No. 125: Deletes language proposed by the 
Senate which prohibits appropriated funds from being used to 
increase fees for services in connection with rail maximum rate 
complaints. The House bill contained no similar provision.
      The conferees believe that following the final decision 
by the Surface Transportation Board on its user fee schedule 
for fiscal year 1997, which was issued on August 14, 1996, it 
would be imprudent to impose additional restrictions on what 
type and/or amount of user fees that the Board can collect. 
Following the termination of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission, both the Congress and the administration suggested 
that the Surface Transportation Board reduce its reliance on 
general fund appropriations. As such, earlier this year, the 
Board planned to increase existing fees and adopt new fees 
where none had been previously imposed, to better reflect the 
costs the Board incurs in providing services to the public. 
After announcing its original plans to raise fees, a 
significant number of concerns were outlined by the affected 
parties. After considering these concerns, the Board decided to 
establish fees that will be significantly lower than those 
originally proposed and substantially below the costs to the 
agency of providing these services. Any party that experiences 
hardship from the fee increase may request relief under the 
Board's fee-waiver procedures. While the conferees are 
reluctant to restrict the Board's ability to set fees, the 
Board should be mindful of raising fees to unreasonable levels.

                              Title III--

                           General Provisions

      Amendment No. 126: Includes ``program,'' as proposed by 
the House instead of ``program;'' as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 127: Includes ``program, and'' as proposed 
by the House instead of ``program;'' as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 128: Deletes language proposed by the 
Senate that would have set aside from the federal-aid highways 
obligation limitation $5,000,000 for construction skill 
training; $5,000,000 for congestion pricing pilot program; 
$15,000,000 for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge; $30,000,000 for 
Appalachian Regional Commission highway construction; and 
$15,000,000 for the Symms National Recreational Trails program. 
The House bill contained no similar provisions.
      Amendment No. 129: Includes ``Provided'' as proposed by 
the House instead of ``Provided further'' as proposed by the 
Senate.
      Amendment No. 130: Provides for a one-time increase in 
the administrative takedown of the federal-aid highways program 
in fiscal year 1997 to 4\1/4\ percent instead of 4\3/4\ percent 
as proposed by the Senate. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.
      Amendment No. 131: Restores House language stricken by 
the Senate that prohibits the use of funds to prepare, propose 
or promulgate any regulations that prescribe changes in the 
corporate average fuel economy standards for automobiles.
      Amendment No. 132: Retains language proposed by the 
Senate that would permit the Administrator of the Federal 
Aviation Administration to expend funds for a sixth runway at 
the new Denver International Airport if safety conditions 
warrant the obligation instead of prohibiting funds as proposed 
by the House.
      Amendment No. 133: Deletes both House and Senate language 
on the expenditure of funds for the collection of airline 
statistics by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and 
makes a technical change to the House engrossed bill. The 
conferees note that section 6006(b) of the Intermodal Surface 
Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) specifies that BTS 
compile, analyze and publish ``a comprehensive set of 
transportation statistics'' and that the conference report 
accompanying ISTEA states, ``data management by [BTS] shall not 
be limited to highway transportation, but is extended to 
include rail, highways, ships and air transport.'' Therefore, 
the conferees believe that funds provided by section 6006(b) of 
ISTEA can be used for the purpose of collecting airline 
statistics should the Department elect to do so.
      Amendment No. 134: Restores House language stricken by 
the Senate that prohibits the use of funds for improvements to 
the Miller Highway in New York City, New York.
      Amendment No. 135: Limits the necessary expenses of 
advisory committees to $1,250,000 instead of $850,000 as 
proposed by the House and $1,050,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 136: Restores House language stricken by 
the Senate that prohibits funds other than those appropriated 
to pay for activities of the Surface Transportation Board.
      Amendment No. 137: Includes language proposed by the 
Senate that exempts the National Railroad Passenger Corporation 
(Amtrak) from certain state and local laws relative to the 
northeastcorridor improvement project. The House bill contained 
no similar provision.
