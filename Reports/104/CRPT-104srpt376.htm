    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, to which was 
referred the bill (S. 695) to provide for the establishment of 
the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas, and for 
other purposes, having considered the same, reports favorably 
thereon with an amendment and recommends that the bill, as

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
          (1) of the 400,000 square miles of tallgrass prairie that 
        once covered the North American Continent, less than 1 percent 
        remains, primarily in the Flint Hills of Kansas;
          (2) in 1991, the National Park Service conducted a special 
        resource study of the Spring Hill Ranch, located in the Flint 
        Hills of Kansas;
          (3) the study concludes that the Spring Hill Ranch--
                  (A) is a nationally significant example of the once 
                vast tallgrass ecosystem, and includes buildings listed 
                on the National Register of Historic Places pursuant to 
                section 101 of the National Historic Preservation Act 
                (16 U.S.C. 470a) that represent outstanding examples of 
                Second Empire and other 19th Century architectural 
                styles; and
                  (B) is suitable and feasible as a potential addition 
                to the National Park System; and
          (4) the National Park Trust, which owns the Spring Hill 
        Ranch, has agreed to permit the National Park Service--
                  (A) to purchase a portion of the ranch, as specified 
                in this subtitle; and
                  (B) to manage the ranch in order to--
                          (i) conserve the scenery, natural and 
                        historic objects, and wildlife of the ranch; 
                        and
                          (ii) provide for the enjoyment of the ranch 
                        in such a manner and by such means as will 
                        leave the scenery, natural and historic 
                        objects, and wildlife unimpaired for the 
                        enjoyment of future generations.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
          (1) to preserve, protect, and interpret for the public an

                         purpose of the measure

    The purpose of S. 695 is to establish the Tallgrass Prairie 
National Preserve in the State of Kansas as a Unit of the 
National Park System.

                          background and need

    The Flint Hills area of Kansas is the location of one of 
the few unaltered expanses of the once vast tallgrass prairie. 
Tallgrass prairie once covered nearly 400,000 square miles of 
the North American continent. Less than one percent of this 
tallgrass prairie remains today, primarily in the Flint Hills.
    The Z-Bar (Spring Hill) Ranch is a 10,894 acre cattle 
ranch, located two miles north of Strong City, in Chase County, 
Kansas. The Ranch contains extensive tallgrass prairie, and was 
originally part of two large cattle ranches which were merged 
in the late nineteenth-century. Historically, the typical Flint 
Hills ranch encompassed thousands of acres on which vast herds 
of cattle grazed during the summer. The Z-Bar Ranch is an 
example of one of the few remaining large ranches in the Flint 
Hills tallgrass prairie area.
    Several buildings on the Z-Bar Ranch are listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places, including the Z-Bar Ranch 
house, a three-story, eleven room structure constructed of 
native limestone in 1881. With its mansard roof and dormer 
windows, the Ranch house is a unique example of Second Empire 
style architecture. The Ranch house and its outbuildings, which 
include a barn, springhouse/smokehouse, outhouse, workshop, 
poultry house, equipment shed and garage, form a composite 
group of rural buildings, built from a single material, which 
function as a unit.
    Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 
the Fox Creek Schoolhouse, located on the ranch property, 
approximately one mile from the ranch headquarters complex. The 
Schoolhouse was built in 1882 and operated as a school between 
1884 and 1930. A local organization currently operates the 
Schoolhouse as a museum.
    In March 1991, the National Park Service completed a 
Special Resource Study of the Z-Bar Ranch. The purpose of the 
study was to determine the site's significance, suitability, 
and feasibility as a potential addition to the National Park 
System. The study concluded that the Z-Bar Ranch was suitable 
for inclusion in the National Park System as it depicts 
significant natural history, architectural, and historical 
themes which are not represented elsewhere within the National 
Park Service.
    The Ranch is currently owned by the National Park Trust. 
The National Trust has agreed to permit the National Park 
Service to purchase a portion of the Ranch and manage it in 
order to preserve, protect, and interpret the tallgrass 
prairie, and the historical and cultural resources represented 
on the Ranch.

                          legislative history

    Senators Kassebaum and Dole introduced S. 695 on April 6, 
1995. The Subcommittee for Parks, Historic Preservation, and 
Recreation held a hearing on the bill on April 5, 1996. Senator 
Bond was added as a co-sponsor on May 8, 1996. Similar 
legislation was included as an amendment to H.R. 1296, a bill 
establishing the Presidio Trust. That bill passed the Senate on 
May 1, 1996 and is pending in conference.
    This legislation is similar to S. 2412, introduced in the 
103rd Congress by Senators Kassebaum, Dole and Campbell. S. 
2412 was introduced on August 19, 1994. Senator Campbell was 
added as a cosponsor on September 30, 1994. No further action 
was taken.
    At the business meeting on September 12, 1996, the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources ordered S. 695 
favorably reported, as amended.

                        committee recommendation

    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in open 
business session on September 12, 1996, by a unanimous voice 
vote of a quorum present, recommends that the Senate pass S. 
695, if amended as described herein.

                          committee amendment

    During the consideration of S. 695, the Committee adopted 
an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The amended bill 
makes technical and conforming corrections, and adds language 
stating that Federal resource protection and management 
regulations will apply on the private land within the Preserve, 
with the consent of the landowner. The amended bill also 
contains new language stating that the Secretary of the 
Interior will be required to prepare a financial analysis 
indicating how the Preserve may be fully supported through 
fees, private donations, and other forms of non-Federal 
funding.
    The bill, as amended, includes language to create the 
Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in the Flint Hills of 
Kansas. The Preserve would be created through a private/public 
partnership between the Federal government and a private 
conservation group. The partnership is the culmination of 
decades of discussions between agriculture and conservation 
interests who, until now, had disagreed over issues such as 
Federal ownership and cattle grazing as part of a tallgrass 
prairie preserve in Kansas. The language contained in the 
amended legislation is the result of consensus building and 
compromise between these various groups.

                   cost and budgetary considerations

    The following estimate of the cost of this measure has been 
provided by the Congressional Budget Office:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 20, 1996.
Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed S. 695, the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve Act of 
1996, as reported by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources on September 16, 1996. Assuming appropriation of the 
necessary amounts, CBO estimates that the federal government 
would spend about $8 million to implement this bill over the 
next five years, including $5 million for planning and 
development and $3 million for operating expenses. Additional 
one-time costs of at least $3 million (and possibly much more) 
and ongoing expenses of about $1 million a year be incurred 
after fiscal year 2001. S. 695 could affect receipts (from 
contributed funds) and direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-
go procedures would apply. We expect, however, that the amount 
of any new receipts or resulting direct spending would not be 
significant. In any event, such receipts and direct spending 
would offset each other.

                              bill purpose

    S. 695 would establish the Tallgrass Prairie National 
Preserve on the grounds of the Spring Hill Ranch in Kansas. The 
National Park Service (NPS) would administer the preserve as a 
unit of the National Park System but would only be authorized 
to acquire, by donation, 180 acres of the 10,894-acre site. The 
remaining land would be operated and maintained by the NPS 
through a cooperative agreement with the National Park Trust, 
the current owner of the ranch. S. 695 would direct the NPS to 
prepare a general management plan for the preserve within three 
years of the bill's enactment. The bill would establish a 13-
member advisory committee to assist in developing the plan and 
managing the preserve.
    Section 5 of the bill would authorize the NPS to accept and 
spend nonfederal contributions of funds, personal property, and 
services for the purpose of implementing the legislation.
    Finally, S. 695 would authorize the appropriation of 
whatever sums are necessary to carry out the legislation, 
including funds to develop, interpret, and manage nonfederal 
lands within the preserve.

                        federal budgetary impact

    CBO estimates that the NPS would spend about $0.6 million 
over the next three years to prepare a management plan for the 
preserve and complete other needed studies and reports. Over 
the following several years, the agency would spend at least $7 
million (for basic visitor facilities and interpretive 
programs) and possibly much more (for road construction and 
historic restoration of ranch buildings). We estimate that 
costs to operate and maintain the park would be about $0.2 
million in fiscal year 1997. Annual operating and maintenance 
costs, which would include minor amounts for advisory committee 
expenses and payments to local governments in lieu of taxes on 
the 180 acres of land to be donated to the NPS, would gradually 
rise to about $1 million by 2001.
    Enacting section 5, which would allow the NPS to accept and 
spend contributed funds, would have no net impact on the 
federal budget because any new revenues collected would be 
offset by new direct spending. We expect that any contributions 
and the resulting spending would be minimal.
    The above estimates are based on information provided by 
the NPS and the National Park Trust, and assume appropriation 
of the entire amounts estimated to be necessary.

                           mandates statement

    S. 695 contains no private-sector or intergovernmental 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local or 
tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Deborah Reis.
            Sincerely,
                                 June E. O'Neill, Director.

                      regulatory impact evaluation

    In compliance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee makes the following 
evaluation of the regulatory impact which would be incurred in 
carrying out S. 695. The bill is not a regulatory measure in 
the sense of imposing Government-established standards or 
significant economic responsibilities on private individuals 
and businesses.
    No personal information would be collected in administering 
the program. Therefore, there would be no impact on personal 
privacy.
    Little, if any, additional paperwork would result from the 
enactment of S. 695, as ordered reported.

                        executive communications

    On September 13, 1996, the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources requested legislative reports from the Department of 
the Interior and the Office of Management and Budget setting 
forth Executive agency recommendations on S. 695. These reports 
had not been received at the time the report on S. 695 was 
filed. When these reports become available, the Chairman will 
request that they be printed in the Congressional Record for 
the advice of the Senate.

    Statement of Roger G. Kennedy, Director, National Park Service, 
                       Department of the Interior

    Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear 
before the committee to testify on S. 695, a bill to provide 
for the establishment of the Tallgrass Prairie National 
Preserve in Kansas, and for other purposes.
    We support enactment of this bill if amended according to 
our testimony.
    S. 695 establishes as a National Preserve approximately 
10,894 acres of land known as the ``Spring Hill Ranch'' in the 
Flint Hills area of Kansas. This land is covered by tall grass 
prairie, a uniquely North American ecosystem that once covered 
400,000 square miles of North America. Less than 1 percent of 
this ecosystem remains, mainly in the Flint Hills. Only a small 
portion of the remaining tall grass prairie (approximately 
3,000 acres spread throughout 32 parks) is presently contained 
in units of the National Park System, and none of these offer 
this ecosystem's natural and cultural resources as their 
primary interpretative theme.
    In a 1991 special resource study of the Spring Hill Ranch, 
the National Park Service (NPS) concluded that the ranch, which 
includes several buildings listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places, is a nationally significant example of the 
once vast tall grass ecosystem and would be a suitable and 
feasible addition to the National Park System. In particular, 
the study noted that the ranch's grasslands are ``diverse, have 
been minimally impacted'', and ``possess outstanding scenic 
value''.
    The property that would form the National Preserve is 
presently owned by the National Park Trust, a non-profit 
corporation. Section 6 of the bill would authorize the 
Secretary to acquire not more than 180 acres of this land, 
which would be made up of two separate parcels. The ranch's 
buildings, which include the culturally significant house, 
barn, and Fox Creek School, among others, rest on 160 of the 
180 acres. The remaining 20 acres would be used to build a 
visitor center (if deemed appropriate through our planning 
process) on a site yet to be determined.
    The Preserve land that will not be acquired by the 
Secretary (approximately 10,714 acres) would be owned by the 
National Park Trust, or its successors. The NPS would have the 
authority under section 6 to acquire rights-of-way on roads not 
owned by the State of Kansas. Under section 5, the NPS would 
manage and interpret the significance of this land, pursuant to 
a cooperative agreement with the Trust.
    The NPS supports the general concepts underlying this bill, 
as they will result in the protection of this valuable and 
important natural and cultural resource. This is why we do not 
object to the language in section 6 that limits our ownership 
in the Preserve to no more than 180 acres. We recognize that it 
is unusual for us to manage and protect land that we do not 
own, and we do not anticipate doing this except in unusual 
circumstances. We strongly believe, however, that, in this 
case, this arrangement is justified, since the land that we 
will own, the 180 acres, will provide us with a core of 
property that will enable us to competently manage and protect 
the entire Preserve.
    In addition, we recommend a few technical amendments to the 
bill that would aid us in performing our stewardship function.
    At the end of section 5(b) after ``Preserve'' insert ``on 
private lands with the consent of the landowner''. This would 
allow fair and equitable administration of the regulations that 
apply to units of the National Park System, including those 
dealing with fee collection, cultural and natural resource 
protection, and others. The regulations would apply to the 
entire Preserve, not just the land that is owned by the NPS, 
but also those lands owned by the Trust, but only with the 
consent of the Trust.
    Section 5(c) provides that ``with consent of the 
landowner'' and section 5(c)(2) provides that the Secretary may 
``maintain and operate programs in connection with the 
Preserve.'' This language appears to give veto power over our 
management decisions to a private party when we believe the 
intent of this section is to authorize the NPS to undertaken 
certain activities on private property within the boundaries of 
the Preserve. We recommend in section 5(c)(1) striking ``on 
real property that is not owned by the Federal Government and 
is located within the Preserve'' and, following ``relating to'' 
in section 5(c), inserting ``private property located within'' 
in order to clarify the intent of this section.
    In section 5(d), the phrase ``Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law'' should be replaced with specific references 
to the statutes that should not apply. This would avoid 
inadvertently waiving relevant and necessary provisions of law.
    In section 5(e) strike ``Notwithstanding any other * * * 
charging'' and insert ``The Preserve shall be considered a unit 
of the National Park System for all purposes, including 
authority to charge''. The only authority for the NPS to charge 
entrance fees is contained in the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund Act. This amendment would make it clear that there is only 
one law that applies to the NPS concerning the charging of 
entrance fees.
    In section 5(f)(2), strike ``Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, the Secretary may solicit,'' and insert ``The 
Secretary may''. It is not customary for the Secretary to 
solicit donations and, coupled with a waiver of all law, 
including conflict of interest provisions, this authority would 
unnecessarily raise opportunities for ethical or legal 
problems.
    Section 5(g)(3)(B) calls for the NPS to provide, through 
the General Management Plan, public access to the Preserve 
``that is consistent with the conservation and proper 
management of the * * * resources of * * * surrounding 
communities.'' We recommend striking ``lands of adjoining 
landowners, and surrounding communities'' and inserting ``and 
is coordinated with plans or surrounding communities and 
adjoining landowners''. This section, as written, asks us to 
make determinations about the level of conservation and 
management for the resource of surrounding communities. These 
issues fall beyond the scope of our authority as a Federal 
agency, and are more appropriately subjects for State and local 
governmental bodies. If this bill is enacted, we would 
certainly be willing to work with the governmental units and 
adjacent land owners.
    Section 5(g)(3)(H) requires the Secretary to offer to enter 
into agreements with individuals that hold grazing rights 
within the Preserve. We recommend amending this language by 
striking ``offer'' and inserting ``recognize the private land 
owners' right'' to enter into agreements so as not to interfere 
with the commercial relationship between the owner of the 
property (the National Park Trust) and the holder of the 
grazing rights. This would identify pre-existing grazing on 
private property as an acceptable use within the boundaries of 
the park.
    We recommend deletion of section 7, which would create an 
Advisory Committee to oversee the management of the Preserve. 
An advisory committee is unnecessary because the NPS regularly 
solicits advice and comments from adjacent land owners and 
other affected parties through the general management planning 
process and subsequent consultations. This would particularly 
be the case in this cooperative arrangement. Deleting this 
section would also be consistent with the President's request 
that Congress show restraint in creating new statutory 
committees or extending existing ones beyond their stated time 
frame. In addition, we should note that there are a number of 
problems in provisions in this section, including restrictions 
on appointments, lack of a sunset provision, and exemptions to 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
    With these technical amendments, we strongly support S. 
695. Through a private/public partnership, this bill would 
protect for future generations a portion of an ecosystem that 
is an immensely significant natural and cultural resource and 
not currently represented as a unit of the National Park 
System.
    Appropriation of funds for operation, development, and land 
acquisition would be contingent upon Federal budgetary 
constraints and Administration funding and land acquisition 
priorities.
    Mr. Chairman, this concludes my remarks. I would be happy 
to answer any questions you may have.


                        changes in existing law


    In compliance with paragraph 12 of rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee notes that no 
changes in existing law are made by this bill S. 695, as 
ordered reported.
