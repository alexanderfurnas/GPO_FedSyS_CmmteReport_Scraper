    Mr. McCain, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

                         [To accompany S. 1893]

    The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the 
bill (S. 1893) to provide for the settlement of issues and 
claims related to the trust lands of the Torres-Martinez Desert 
Cahuilla Indians, and for other purposes, having considered the 
same, reports favorably thereon without amendment and 
recommends that the bill do pass.

                                purpose

    The purpose of S. 1893 is to provide for the settlement of 
issues and claims related to the trust lands of the Torres-
Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians of California.

                               background

    The Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians have lived in 
the Coachella Valley area of Southern California for hundreds 
of years. The Tribe currently numbers more than 500 members, 
who live on or in the vicinity of the more than 40 separate 
land parcels that comprise the Torres-Martinez Reservation.
    The Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation was created in 1876 
in Coachella Valley north of the Salton Sink. In 1891, an 
Executive Order expanded the original 640-acre reservation by 
about 12,000 acres. Between 1905 and 1907, flood waters of the 
Colorado River filled the Salton Sink, creating the Salton Sea 
and inundating about 2,000 acres of the 1891 reservation lands. 
In 1909, a Secretarial Order transferred another 12,000 acres 
of land to the Reservation. About 9,000 acres of these lands 
were submerged under the Salton Sea; however, it was expected 
at the time of the transfer that the Salton Sea would recede 
from these lands within 25 years. Contrary to expectations, the 
Salton Sea did not recede, in large part due to natural runoff 
and drainage water flowing into it from the irrigation systems 
of the Imperial, Coachella, and Mexicali Valleys. This 
irrigation drainage was facilitated by various actions by the 
federal government, including construction of the Coachella 
Canal in the 1940's. Currently, 11,800 acres of the Tribe's 
25,000-acre reservation are either under water or are not 
irrigable due to lack of proper drainage.
    In 1982, the United States brought an action in trespass in 
the Federal District Court of Southern California on behalf of 
the Tribe and its affected allottee landowners against the 
Imperial Irrigation District and the Coachella Valley Water 
District. This suit sought damages related to the inundation of 
Indian lands and injunctive relief against further flooding of 
those lands. On August 25, 1992, the court entered a final 
judgment which found the two districts liable for trespass but 
denied the United States' request for injunctive relief and 
ejectment. The Court ordered the two districts to pay the Tribe 
a total of $3,008,602 in past and future damages in lieu of a 
permanent injunction against continued flooding of the 
submerged lands.
    The United States, the two districts and the Tribe appealed 
the District Court's decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals. Subsequently, the Interior and Justice Departments 
entered into negotiations with the Tribe and the two districts 
in an effort to avoid a lengthy and costly appellate process 
and finally to resolve the dispute. Another objective of the 
negotiations was to resolve similar claims brought by the Tribe 
and affected allottees in a separate lawsuit against the United 
States and the two districts. To facilitate settlement 
negotiations, the court stayed action on the appeals as well as 
initial action on the Indians' separate suit.
    On June 18, 1996, after months of difficult negotiations, 
representatives of the United States, the Tribe, the Imperial 
Irrigation District and the Coachella Valley Water District 
signed a Settlement Agreement that resolves their conflicting 
claims and provides for dismissal of litigation. Enactment of 
Federal legislation is necessary to ratify this Agreement and 
to authorize the actions and appropriations necessary for its 
implementation. Accordingly, on June 16, 1996, Representative 
Sonny Bono (R-CA) introduced H.R. 3640 in the House of 
Representatives, and on June 18, 1996, Senators Diane Feinstein 
(D-CA) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced S. 1893 in the 
Senate.

                    summary of settlement provisions

    S. 1893 ratifies the Settlement Agreement and provides for 
its implementation. The bill provides for the establishment of 
trust accounts in the U.S. Treasury for the benefit of the 
Tribe and its affected allottee landowners. It authorizes 
payment of $10,200,000 in federal funds--$4.2 million from the 
Justice Department's Judgment Fund and $6 million in 
appropriated funds, to be paid into the tribal and allottee 
trust accounts. Coachella Valley Water District will pay 
$388,000 and Imperial Irrigation District will pay $3,671,000 
into these accounts, making the settlement payments total 
$14,200,000.
    The Settlement Agreement and S. 1893 provide for the 
Interior Department to take into trust status up to 11,800 
acres of land (an amount equal to the flooded area) purchased 
or otherwise acquired by the Tribe within two separate 
acquisition areas located roughly within the west and east 
boundaries of the Coachella Valley, subject to certain 
conditions. Trust acquisitions within the secondary area are 
limited to 640 acres and must be consolidated into not more 
than two separate parcels. Trust acquisitions in the primary 
area are limited to 11,800 acres minus the number of acres 
acquired in the secondary acquisition area.
    The settlement further provides that land acquired by the 
Tribe in the secondary acquisition area will be taken into 
trust only if the governing body of a city in whose 
incorporated area the land is located, or Riverside County if 
the land is located in an unincorporated area, does not object 
to such trust acquisition. The same restriction will apply to 
land acquired by the Tribe within the boundaries of an 
incorporated city or an unincorporated area located in the 
primary acquisition area. Lands located within either area and 
situated within a one mile radius of the reservation lands of 
any other Indian tribe will not be eligible for conveyance into 
trust absent the consent of the affected Indian tribe.
    The Tribe's right to conduct gaming on lands taken into 
trust pursuant to the settlement is limited and restricted to 
one gaming operation on one physical site. Any gaming on these 
lands must be conducted consistent with the requirements of the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701; 102 Stat. 2467). 
Lands taken into trust for the Tribe shall be considered as if 
they were acquired in 1909 except with respect to water rights. 
Lands acquired by the Tribe will be subject to all valid water 
rights existing at the time of acquisition, and the Tribe will 
obtain all valid water rights appurtenant to acquired lands.
    The settlement also provides that the Tribe and the United 
States will convey to the water districts a permanent flowage 
easement over all Indian trust lands (approximately 11,800 
acres), and all Federal lands (approximately 110,000 acres) 
located within and below the minus 220, contour of the Salton 
Sink.

                          legislative history

    S. 1893 was introduced by Senators Diane Feinstein (D-CA) 
and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) on June 19, 1996. The Committee on 
Indian Affairs held a hearing on the bill on July 18, 1996, at 
which supporting testimony was received from Senator Feinstein, 
Representative Sonny Bono (R-CA), Michael Anderson, Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, Mary Belardo, Chairwoman, Torres-Martinez Tribe, Tom 
Levy, General Manager, Coachella Valley Water District, and 
William R. Condit, President, Board of Directors, Imperial 
Irrigation District. The Committee also received resolutions or 
letters of support for the legislation from the Riverside 
County Board of Supervisors, the City of Coachella, the City of 
Desert Hot Springs, Cathedral City, the Agua Caliente Band of 
Cahuilla Indians, and the Augustine, Cahuilla, Jamul, 
Manzanita, Morongo, Soboba, and Twenty-Nine Palms Bands of 
Mission Indians. Four of these Indian bands currently operate 
gaming facilities in the Coachella Valley. The Committee also 
received letters from the Coachella Valley. The Committee also 
received letters from the City of Palm Desert and the City of 
Indian Wells expressing conditional support for the settlement, 
and letters from the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, which 
also operates a gaming facility in the Coachella Valley, 
opposing the trust land selection provisions of S. 1893.
    In the House of Representatives, Congressman Sonny Bono (R-
CA) inroduced H.R. 3640 on June 16, 1996. The bill was referred 
to the Committee on Resources. On June 19, 1996, the 
Subcommittee on Native American and Insular Affairs held a 
hearing on H.R. 3640. The Full Committee on Resources marked up 
and ordered the bill favorably reported to the House of 
Representatives on August 1, 1996.

            committee recommendation and tabulation of vote

    On July 24, 1996, the Committee on Indian Affairs, in an 
open business session, considered S. 1893 and ordered it 
reported, without amendment, with a recommendation that the 
bill be passed.

                      section-by-section analysis

Section 1. Short title

    This section cites the short title of S. 1893 as the 
``Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians Claims Settlement Act 
of 1996''.

Section 2. Congressional findings and purpose

    This section sets forth Congressional findings and purpose. 
Subsection (a) states findings and declarations that:
    (1) in 1876, 640 acres north of the Salton Sink in the 
Coachella Valley, California, were designated as the Torres-
Martinez Indian Reservation; in 1891, an Executive Order issued 
pursuant to the Mission Relief Act of 1891 added another 12,000 
acres to the reservation;
    (2) between 1905 and 1907, Colorado River flood waters 
filled the Salton Sink, creating the Salton Sea and inundating 
approximately 2,000 acres of the 1891 reservation lands;
    (3) in 1909, a Secretarial Order, issued pursuant to a 1907 
amendment to the Mission Relief Act, added 12,000 acres of 
land, 9,000 of which were then submerged under the Salton Sea, 
to the reservation, with the expectation that the sea would 
recede from the submerged acreage within 25 years;
    (4) a majority of the lands added to the reservation in 
1909 remain inundated due in part to the flowage of natural 
runoff and drainage water from irrigation systems of the 
Imperial, Coachella, and Mexicali Valleys into the Salton Sea;
    (5) in addition to the inundated lands, other tribal and 
individual Indian lands located on the perimeter of the Salton 
Sea are not irrigable due to the lack of proper drainage;
    (6) in 1982, the United States, in its own right and on 
behalf of the Tribe and Allottees, brought an action in 
trespass seeking damages and injunctive relief (the United 
States Suit) against the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) and 
Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD);
    (7) in 1992, a federal court entered judgment in the United 
States Suit requiring CVWD to pay $212,908, and IID to pay 
$2,795,694, in past and future damages to the Tribe in lieu of 
a permanent injunction against continued flooding of submerged 
lands;
    (8) the United States, CVWD and IID and the Tribe filed 
notices of appeal regarding the United States Suit;
    (9) the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stayed 
further action on appeals pending the outcome of settlement 
negotiations;
    (10) in 1991, the Tribe, for itself and for an individual 
Allottee in her own right and as class representative of all 
other affected Indian allottees, brought suit (the Indian Suit) 
against the two water districts;
    (11) the Indian Suit was stayed by the court to facilitate 
settlement negotiations;
    Subsection (b) states the purpose of the bill is to 
facilitate and implement the Settlement Agreement reached by 
the United States, the Tribe, CVWD and IID.

                    cost and budgetary consideration

    The cost and budgetary impact of S. 1893, as evaluated by 
the Congressional Budget Office, is set forth below:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                    Washington, DC, August 9, 1996.
Hon. John McCain,
Chairman, Committee on Indian Affairs,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1893, the Torres-
Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians Claims Settlement Act.
    Enacting S. 1893 would not affect direct spending or 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply 
to the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).
    Enclosure.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: S. 1893.
    2. Bill title: Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians 
Claims Settlement Act.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee 
on Indian Affairs on July 24, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: S. 1893 would ratify a settlement 
agreement entered into by the Department of Justice, the 
Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water 
District, and the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indian Tribe. 
The settlement agreement is designed to provide compensation to 
the tribe for the flooding of reservation lands and relief 
against further inundation of those lands. According to the 
agreement, the tribe would receive monetary compensation from 
the United States and the two water districts. In addition, the 
Interior Department would take into trust up to 11,800 acres of 
land acquired by the tribe, and the tribe would be permitted to 
conduct gaming on lands taken into trust pursuant to the 
agreement.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The bill would 
authorize an appropriation of $6 million to the tribe and its 
member landowners. Assuming enactment by the end of fiscal year 
1996 and appropriation of the funds for fiscal year 1997, CBO 
estimates that the tribe would spend out the money over the 
next three years.

                                    [By fiscal years, in millions of dollars]                                   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002

                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION                                       
                                                                                                                
Authorization level.......................................        6  .......  .......  .......  .......  .......
Estimated outlays.........................................        3        2        1  .......  .......  .......
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The costs of this bill fall within budget function 450.
    The tribe also would receive a payment of $4.2 million from 
the Claims and Judgments Fund. This payment would not represent 
a new obligation of the U.S. government, but would simply 
satisfy a commitment already made. That commitment stems from 
court action begun in 1982 and ultimately resolved by the 
settlement agreement negotiated by the parties to two separate 
suits, both of which have been suspended pending the outcome of 
such negotiations. The agreement entered into by the Department 
of Justice, the water districts, and the tribe calls for 
payment by the U.S. government of $4.2 million to the tribe. 
(The agreement also calls for payments by the two water 
districts to the tribe). Because the settlement agreement 
commits the U.S. government to the $4.2 million payment, 
enacting S. 1893 would not cause any increase in direct 
spending from the Claims and Judgments Fund.
    6. Basis of estimate: Funds that the tribe would receive 
may be spent on attorney fees, per capita payments, land 
acquisition, and other activities as stipulated by the 
settlement agreement. CBO expects that some of the funds would 
be spent quickly, while other activities such as the purchase 
of land would take longer. As a result, we estimate that about 
one-half of the $6 million would be spent in the year that 
funds are appropriated, with the remainder spread over the 
subsequent two years.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.
    8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: S. 1983 contains no intergovernmental mandates as 
defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 
104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal 
governments. Any costs resulting from the settlement agreement 
covered by this bill would incurred voluntarily by state, 
local, and tribal governments as parties to the agreement.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would 
impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: None.
    11. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Rachel 
Robertson. Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: 
Marjorie Miller. Impact on the Private Sector: Amy Downs.
    12. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant 
Director for Budget Analysis.

                      regulatory impact statement

    Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the 
Senate requires each report accompanying a bill to evaluate the 
regulatory and paperwork impact that would be incurred in 
carrying out the bill. The Committee believes that S. 1893 will 
have no regulatory or paperwork impact.

                        executive communications

    The statement presented by the Department of the Interior 
at the July 18, 1996 hearing is set forth below:

  Testimony of Michael Anderson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Indian 
                  Affairs, Department of the Interior

    Mr. Chairman, I am here today on behalf of the 
Administration to testify in favor of S. 1893, which, if 
enacted, will ratify the June 18, 1996 settlement agreement 
resolving claims and issues related to lands held in trust by 
the United States for the benefit of the Torres-Martinez 
Indians. Before I begin, I would like to first thank you and 
the Committee for so promptly holding this hearing after the 
introduction of S. 1893. The resolution of this long-standing 
dispute between the tribe and two water districts in Southern 
California is long overdue and the Committee is to be commended 
for its efforts to implement the underlying agreement as is 
Senator Feinstein for her efforts in introducing S. 1893.
    H.R. 3640, the House companion bill to S. 1893 introduced 
last month by Congressman Bono, is expected to be favorably 
voted out of the House Committee on Natural Resources within 
the next few days. Given the spirit of bipartisanship 
demonstrated by the House committee and reflected in the 
sponsorship of the two bills, we are confident that S. 1893 
will receive the same broad support given to H.R. 3640. Indeed, 
everyone involved in the effort to reach a settlement of this 
matter has gone to great lengths to secure this support of 
those parties who stand to be affected by implementation of the 
agreement. For its part, the Department of the Interior engaged 
in widespread discussions with federal, tribal and local 
governmental authorities on the impact of the settlement. 
Letters of support for the settlement have been received by 
each of the neighboring tribes to the Torres-Martinez 
reservation, with the exception of the Cabazon Tribe which was 
inadvertently omitted from the list of tribes contacted about 
the settlement. Since the hearing on this bill before the House 
Native American Affairs subcommittee, the Department has 
explained the settlement to officials of the Cabazon Tribe.
    The Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation, located in the 
vicinity of the Salton Sink in the Coachella Valley, 
California, was first established by executive order in 1876 
and enlarged under executive orders in 1891 and 1909. The 
origins of the dispute may be traced back to the years 1905 to 
1907 when flood waters of the Colorado River filled the Salton 
Sink, inundating a portion of the Torres-Martinez Reservation 
and creating what is today known as the Salton Sea. At the 
time, it was expected that the water level of the Salton Sea 
would recede through the process of evaporation within a period 
of twenty five years and that previously flooded lands would 
dry out. However, due to natural runoff and agricultural 
drainage water from the Imperial, Coachella Valley and Mexicali 
irrigation systems that flow into the Salton Sea, approximately 
11,800 acres of tribal and allotted lands were, and have 
remained, inundated from as early as 1924.
    In 1982, the United States brought an action in trespass 
against the Imperial Irrigation District and Coachella Valley 
Water District on behalf of the Torres-Marrtinez Tribe. On 
August 25, 1992, the court entered a final judgment which found 
the irrigation districts liable for trespass but denied the 
United States' request for injunctive relief and ejectment. 
Subsequent to the judgment, the Department and the Department 
of Justice engaged in negotiations with the tribe and 
irrigation districts in an effort to correct what the agencies 
believe is an inequitable judicial result and to avoid a 
lengthy and costly appeal. A second objective of the settlement 
negotiations was the resolution of claims brought by the tribe 
in a separate lawsuit against the United States and the 
districts, as well as potential claims against the United 
States.
    After several years of difficult and contentious 
negotiations among the parties and countless discussions with 
entities that stand to be affected by resolution of this 
historical wrong, the parties have reached a settlement which 
the Department believes is a significant step toward fulfilling 
the Torres-Martinez Tribe's quest for self sufficiency.
    In its present form, S. 1893 accurately reflects the 
essential provisions of the settlement agreement negotiated and 
executed by the parties. In addition to approving, ratifying, 
and confirming the settlement agreement in its entirety, the 
bill specifically provides for the following essential terms of 
the agreement:

          Monetary contribution of approximately $14 million 
        from the U.S. and irrigation districts to the tribe. Of 
        the $10.2 million to be paid by the U.S., the bill 
        authorizes a payment of $4.2 million from the Judgment 
        Fund and $6 million from appropriated monies.
          Subject to certain conditions specified in the bill 
        and Agreement, the Department would take into trust up 
        to 11,800 acres of land (any amount equal to the 
        flooded area) purchased or otherwise acquired by the 
        Tribe within two separate acquisition areas. The 
        primary area of acquisition extends from the Riveside--
        Imperial County line north to just north of the thermal 
        airport. The secondary acquisition area extends from 
        the northern boundary of the primary area to just south 
        of Cathedral City. Both areas lie roughly within the 
        west and east boundaries of the Coachella Valley. Trust 
        acquisitions within the secondary area is limited to 
        640 acres and must be consolidated into no more than 
        two separate parcels. Trust acquisitions in the primary 
        area would be limited to 11,800 acres minus the number 
        of acres acquired in trust in the secondary acquisition 
        area.
          Land purchased or otherwise acquired by the Tribe in 
        the secondary acquisition area would be taken into 
        trust only if the local governing body or Riverside 
        County did not object to such trust acquisition. The 
        same restriction for taking land into trust would apply 
        to land acquired by the Tribe within the boundaries of 
        an incorporated city located in the primary acquisition 
        area. In this regard, it is noted that both the 
        Agreement and the bill are intended to provide the 
        Tribe and local authorities the opportunity and 
        flexibility required to reach agreements to address 
        particular concerns related to taking land into trust. 
        For instance, nothing in the bill prohibits the Tribe 
        and a particular city from negotiating an agreement 
        providing for the rights and obligations of each with 
        regard to certain issues that may arise after the land 
        is in trust. Such an agreement, properly entered into, 
        would be an enforceable contract in a court of 
        competent jurisdiction.
          Lands located within either area and situated within 
        a one mile radius of the reservation lands of any other 
        Indian tribe would be eligible for conveyance into 
        trust only with the consent of the affected Indian 
        tribe.
          The irrigation districts would be granted an easement 
        in perpetuity as to all lands within the -220, contour 
        of the Salton Sink. The Agreement would not affect the 
        ability of the United States to initiate actions to 
        enforce applicable water rights or environmental laws.
          The Tribe's right to conduct gaming on lands taken 
        into trust pursuant to the Agreement is limited and 
        restricted to one gaming operation on one physical 
        site.

    Any and all rights which the Tribe now enjoys under 
existing law are not affected by the bill or the provisions of 
the Agreement.
    This concludes my statement. I will be happy to answer any 
questions the Committee may have.

                        CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW

    S. 1893, as reported, makes no changes in existing law.

    The text of the Agreement of Compromise and Settlement 
Concerning Claims to Lands of the United States Within and on 
the Perimeter of the Salton Sea Drainage Reservoir Held in 
Trust for the Torres-Martinez Indians, dated June 18, 1996, is 
set forth below:

 Agreement of Compromise and Settlement Concerning Claims to Lands of 
    the United States Within and on the Perimeter of the Salton Sea 
    Drainage Reservoir Held in Trust for the Torres-Martinez Indians

    This Agreement of Compromise and Settlement (hereinafter 
``Agreement'') is made this 18th day of June, 1996 between the 
United States of America, in its own right and as Trustee on 
behalf of the Torres-Martinez Band of Mission Indians and 
affected Indian allotment owners (hereinafter ``United 
States''), acting through the Secretary of the Interior 
(hereinafter ``Secretary''); the Torres-Martinez Desert 
Cahuilla Indians (hereinafter ``Tribe''); the Imperial 
Irrigation District (hereinafter ``IID''); the Coachella Valley 
Water District (hereinafter ``CVWD''); and Mary Resvaloso, in 
her own right and as class representative of all other affected 
Indian allotment owners; sometimes referred to collectively as 
the ``Parties.''

                                recitals

    WHEREAS, the Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation 
(hereinafter ``Reservation''), located in the Coachella Valley, 
California, at the northern end of the Salton Basin, was 
established by Executive Order on May 15, 1876, reserving a 
single section (640 acres) of land for the use and benefit of 
the Tribe; and
    WHEREAS, the Reservation was expanded by an Executive Order 
issued on December 19, 1891, pursuant to the Mission Indian 
Relief Act of 1891, adding to the Reservation about 12,000 
acres of lands situated between the mountain foothills and the 
Salton Sink which at its lowest point measures at approximately 
275 feet below sea level; and
    WHEREAS, from 1905-1907, the flood waters of the Colorado 
River filled the Salton Sink, creating the Salton Sea and 
inundating a portion of the 1891 reservation lands; and
    WHEREAS, in 1909 an additional 12,000 acres of land, 9,000 
of which were then submerged under the Salton Sea, were added 
to the Reservation under an Executive Order issued pursuant to 
a 1907 amendment of the Mission Indian Relief Act; and
    WHEREAS, due to receding water levels in the Salton Sea 
through the process of evaporation at the time of the second 
enlargement of the Reservation in 1909, there were some 
expectations that the Salton Sea would recede within a period 
of 25 years; and
    WHEREAS, the United States, the Tribe and the affected 
Indian allotment owners contend that agricultural drainage 
waters from the Imperial, Mexicali and Coachella Valleys 
irrigation systems flow into the Salton Sea, and that these 
waters commingle with natural runoff and precipitation causing 
both inundation of Reservation and allottee-owned lands under 
the Salton Sea (approximately 11,800 acres) and damages to 
Reservation and allottee-owned lands on or near the perimeter 
of the Salton Sea (approximately 4,700 acres) due to saturation 
(hereinafter ``perimeter lands''); and
    WHEREAS, in 1982, the U.S. brought an action in trespass 
entitled United States of America, in its own right and on 
behalf of Torres-Martinez Band of Mission Indians and the 
Allottees therein v. The Imperial Irrigation District and 
Coachella Valley Water District, Case No. 82-1790 K (M) 
(hereinafter ``U.S. Suit'') on behalf of the Torres-Martinez 
Indian Tribe and affected Indian allottees against IID and CVWD 
for past damages related to the inundation of Reservation and 
allottee-owned lands and injunctive relief to prevent future 
discharge of water on such lands; and
    Whereas, on August 20, 1992, the Federal District Court, 
Southern District of California entered a judgment in the U.S. 
Suit requiring CVWD to pay $70,238.41 in past damages and 
$142,670 in future damages for a total of $212,908.41 and IID, 
$940,984,33 in past damages and $1,854,710 in future damages, 
for a total of $2,795,694.33, resulting in a combined total of 
$3,008,608.74; and
    Whereas, the United States, IID and CVWD have filed notices 
of appeal with United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit from the district court's judgment in the U.S. Suit 
(No's. 93-55389, 93-55398 and 93-55402) and the Tribe has filed 
a notice of appeal from the district court's denial of its 
motion to intervene as a matter of right (No. 92-55129);
    Whereas, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has 
stayed further action on the appeals pending the outcome of 
settlement negotiations; and
    Whereas, in 1991, the Tribe brought its own lawsuit, 
Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, et al., v. Imperial 
Irrigation District, et al., Case No. 91-1670 J (LSP) 
(hereinafter ``Indian Suit'') in the United States District 
Court, Southern District of California against the two 
districts, and amended the complaint to include as an 
additional plaintiff, Mary Resvaloso, in her own right and as 
class representative of all other affected Indian allotment 
owners; and
    Whereas, the Indian Suit has been stayed by the District 
Court to facilitate settlement negotiations.
    Whereas, The United States, the Tribe, IID, CVWD and Mary 
Resvaloso on behalf of all affected Indian allotment owners, 
believe it is in their best interests to enter into this 
Agreement as a compromise and final settlement of all issues 
and claims in both the U.S. Suit and the Indian Suit;
    Now Therefore, in consideration of the following terms, 
conditions, and promises, the Parties agree as follows:

IV. Mutual release and satisfaction of all claims

    (a) The Parties mutually understand and agree that the 
benefits to be received under the Agreement and the Settlement 
Legislation shall constitute full and complete satisfaction of 
all claims by each Party against any other Party alleged in

form appropriate and necessary to accomplish the dismissal of 
the suits, within 30 days following either the date this 
Agreement is enacted into law by the Settlement Legislation, or 
the date this Agreement is approved by the District Court in 
accordance with Section XI, whichever of the two dates is 
later.

    (e) For this purposes of this Agreement, the term 
``permanent flowage easement'' shall mean the perpetual right 
by the water districts to use the prescribed lands within and 
below the -220, contour as a drainage reservoir to receive and 
store water from their respective water and drainage systems 
including flood water, return flows from irrigation, tail 
water, leach water, operational spills, and any other water 
which overflows and floods said lands originating from lands

        water in place of ground water for irrigation purposes. 
        Provided CVWD provides canal water, as set forth 
        herein, the Tribe shall not pump or allow others,

        discretion;
          (3) CVWD shall serve canal water to the Tribes

X. Settlement legislation

    All parties agree to support the introduction and enactment 
of legislation to implement this Agreement which is 
substantially the same in text and form as that proposed 
legislation attached hereto as Exhibit ``E''. This Agreement 
shall be effective only if the Settlement Legislation does not 
alter the essential terms of the Agreement.

XI. Settlement litigation

    (a) The Parties all mutually intend that this Agreement 
shall fully, fairly and finally resolve all claims pertaining 
to all Indian trust lands covered by this Agreement, including 
not only tribal lands owned by the Tribe but also allotted 
lands owned by a large number of individual Indian trust 
beneficiaries or their assigns. Some of the affected allottees 
are represented in the U.S. Suit by their federal trustee, the 
United States. All affected allottees are represented in the 
Indian Suit by Mary Resvaloso, an individual allottee and class 
representative. The party representatives of the absent 
allottees are satisfied that the Agreement fully and fairly 
compensates all affected landowners, whether tribal or 
individual, and that it is necessary and proper to make this 
agreement finally conclusive and binding upon all such 
landowners. Consequently, the Parties to the Agreement 
stipulate that:
          (1) within 5 days of signing the Agreement or as soon 
        thereafter as is possible, they shall file a joint 
        motion in the United States Court of Appeals for the 
        Ninth Circuit for a limited remand of the U.S. Suit for 
        purposes of class certification and approval of 
        settlement;
          (2) within 5 days of an order by the court of appeals 
        granting a limited remand, the Parties shall file a 
        motion or joint motions in the United States District 
        Court for the Southern District of California, seeking 
        the following actions from the court:
                  (A) Consolidation of the U.S. Suit and the 
                Indian Suit for purposes of class certification 
                for settlement purpose only, approval of 
                settlement and notice of same.
                  (B) Approval by the court of a form of notice 
                to be given to allottee class members pursuant 
                to the notice requirements of Federal Rule of 
                Civil Procedure 23(c) (``Rule 23(c)'') and Rule 
                23(e), concerning future actions to be taken in 
                the two consolidated lawsuits, including the 
                certification of a class for settlement 
                purposes only under Rule 23(b)(3) and approval 
                of the Agreement under Rule 23(e).
                  (C) Issuance of an order requiring all 
                interested parties and putative class members 
                to appear at a time certain and show cause why 
                the court should not certify for settlement 
                purposes only a defined class of affected 
                allottee landowners under Rule 23(b)(3) and 
                approve the Agreement under Rule 23(e).
                  (D) Conduct of a hearing by the court with 
                respect to the matters set forth in preceding 
                subparagraph (C), to be held no sooner than 
                sixty (60) days after notice to the parties of 
                the date set by the court for such hearings.
                  (E) Entry by the court of orders certifying 
                for settlement purposes only a defined allottee 
                class under Rule 23(b)(3) and approving the 
                Agreement under Rule 23(e).
    (b) Within five days of receiving notice of the hearing 
referred to in subparagraph (a)(2)(D) above, the United States 
shall provide notice to putative class members in the form 
approved by the court pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2)(B) above, 
which notice the United States presently expects will require 
publication and individual mailings to the last known addresses 
of all owners of affected allotments (or of fractional 
interests therein), as revealed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
(BIA) realty records regarding such allottee ownership. At the 
hearing, the United States shall be prepared to describe to the 
court the manner in which it attempted to notify all affected 
allotment owners.
    (c) If a significant number of the putative class whose 
interests in the perimeter lands elect to be excluded from the 
class, the Parties retain the right to repudiate the Agreement. 
For purposes of this paragraph, ``a significant number'' is 
equal to those allottees or their heirs whose interests in 
these lands aggregates to a total of 470 acres, or more, which 
is 10 percent or more of the total perimeter lands.
    (d) If within one hundred twenty (120) days following the 
date on which the court issues an order approving the form of 
notice filed by the Parties with the motion set forth in 
paragraph (a)(2) above, the court shall fail to certify a class 
of affected allottees for settlement purposes only under Rule 
23(b)(3) or should fail to approve the Agreement under Rule 
23(e) as being fair and reasonable, each party reserves the 
right to timely withdraw from the Agreement after the 
expiration of such four-month period, by giving written notice 
to the other parties of such withdrawal; provided, that if no 
notice of withdrawal is given by any party within five months 
of the filing of said motion or motions, the Parties shall be 
deemed to have waived their right of withdrawal under this 
paragraph.
