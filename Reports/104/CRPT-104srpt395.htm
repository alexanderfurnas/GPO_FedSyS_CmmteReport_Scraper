  Mr. Murkowski, from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, 
                        submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 3198]

    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, to which was 
referred the Act (H.R. 3198) to reauthorize and amend the 
National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992, and for other purposes, 
having considered the same, reports favorably thereon without 
amendment and recommends that the Act do pass.

                         Purpose of the Measure

    The purpose of H.R. 3198 is to reauthorize appropriations 
for the National Geological Mapping Act of 1992 which will 
expire at the end of the fiscal year 1996.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

    The National Geologic Mapping Act (NGMA) of 1992 (Public 
Law 102-285; 43 United States Code 31a-h) was the legislative 
response to concerns of the National Academy of Sciences as to 
the inadequacy of basic geologic mapping efforts in the 
country. The NGMA established a cooperative program involving 
the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the geologic surveys of the 
50 States and academia to pursue an expanded geologic mapping 
effort of bedrock and surficial terranes.
    Detailed geologic mapping provides basic information for 
solving a broad range of societal problems. These include the 
delineation and protection of sources of safe drinking water, 
environmental system understanding, and foundations of 
ecosystems management; identification and mitigation of natural 
hazards, such as earthquake-prone areas, volcanic eruptions, 
landslides and other ground failures, and many other land-use 
planning requirements; and assessment of coal, petroleum and 
natural gas, construction materials, metals, and other natural 
resources.
    Only about one-fifth of the Nation is mapped at a scale 
adequate to meet these needs. Reauthorization of the NGMA will 
allow Federal, State and academic interests to continue to 
address these needs cooperatively. The critical areas have been 
identified at the State level by State-map advisory committees. 
These critical areas include Federal, State, and local 
priorities.
    Since its establishment in 1879, the USGS has been charged 
with ``classification of the public lands and examination of 
the geological structure, mineral resources and products of the 
national domain.'' While generally receiving good marks for its 
geologic mapping efforts for over a century, the National 
Academy of Sciences in a 1988 report recognized that the USGS 
alone lacked the manpower to overcome this deficiency. 
Traditionally, colleges and universities as well as the various 
State geologic surveys have contributed to the mix of geologic 
maps produced, albeit not always in a coordinated manner. The 
NGMA provides a cooperative frame-work to attempt to meet the 
Nation's geologic map data needs efficiently.
    Funding for the program is incorporated in the budget of 
the U.S. Geological Survey. State geological surveys and 
university participants receive funding from the program 
through a competitive proposal process that requires 50:50 
matching funds from the applicant, ensuring the value of each 
proposal is weighed against its cost in Federal and State 
appropriated funds. Since fiscal year 1993, approximately $7.5 
million of Federal appropriated funds have been matched by 
State monies in the cooperative, peer-reviewed program for 
geologic map products produced by the 50 State geological 
surveys, about 15 percent of the total Federal appropriation 
over the same interval for geologic mapping program efforts in 
total.
    While the Committee recognizes the critical role mapping 
plays in the assessment of the nation's geologic resources, 
environment, and hazards, there is also a recognition that the 
Federal funding necessary to support the work is diminishing. 
In response to this growing financial deficit, the Committee 
urges the U.S. Geological Survey to actively seek 
opportunities, where appropriate, to increase the role of the 
private sector in this important national program.

                          Legislative History

    On March 29, 1996, Congressman Ken Calvert introduced H.R. 
3198 in the House of Representatives. On April 23, 1996 the 
House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources held a 
hearing on the legislation. On July 11, 1996 the bill was 
favorably reported by the House Committee on Resources and on 
July 30, 1996 the bill passed the House by voice vote. The bill 
was referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources.

            Committee Recommendation and Tabulation of Votes

    The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in 
open business session on September 12, 1996, by voice vote of a 
quorum present, recommends that the Senate pass H.R. 3198.

                      Section-by-Section Analysis

                         section 1. short title

    The bill may be cited as the ``National Geologic Mapping 
Reauthorization Act of 1996.''

                          section 2. findings

    This section of the bill provides Congressional findings 
about the national need for geologic mapping performed in a 
comprehensive and cooperative manner.

                section 3. reauthorization and amendment

    Section 3 reauthorizes and amends the expiring NGMA. The 
Federal/State/academia cooperative elements of the original Act 
are retained with minor amendments in definitions. The bill 
also establishes an advisory committee to the USGS Director on 
planning and implementation of the geologic mapping program, 
corrects references to the Committee on Resources in an annual 
report to the Committee, and authorizes appropriations for 
funding the cooperative geologic mapping program of the USGS 
and allocates funds between the Federal, State and education 
components of the program for the next four fiscal years.

                   Cost and Budgetary Considerations

    The following estimate of costs of this measure has been 
provided by the Congressional Budget Office:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 18, 1996.
Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, 
        Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3198, the National 
Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act of 1996.
    Enacting H.R. 3198 would not affect direct spending or 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply 
to the legislation.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: H.R. 3198.
    2. Bill title: National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization 
Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources on September 16, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: H.R. 3198 would reauthorize and amend the 
National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992, which established a 
cooperative program for geologic mapping between the United 
States Geological Survey (USGS), the state geologic surveys, 
and academia. The legislation would authorize appropriations 
for fiscal years 1997 through 2000 for the geologic mapping 
program and would change the allocation of funds between the 
federal, state, and educational components. Other provisions 
would make minor definitional changes in the 1992 act, change 
the size and membership of the advisory committee to the USGS 
Director on planning and implementation of the geologic mapping 
program, and codify an existing requirement that federal 
funding of geologic mapping education be matched on a one-to-
one basis by nonfederal sources.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming 
appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO estimates that 
enacting H.R. 3198 would result in additional discretionary 
spending of $108 million over the 1997-2001 period. The costs 
of the legislation are shown in the following table.

                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]

\1\ The 1996 level is the amount appropriated for that year.                                                    

    The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 
300.
    6. Basis of estimate: For the purposes of this estimate, 
CBO assumes that all amounts authorized in H.R. 3198 would be 
appropriated by the start of each fiscal year and that outlays 
would follow the historical spending patterns for the national 
geologic mapping program.
    CBO estimates that other provisions in the legislation 
would have no significant budgetary impact. For example, H.R. 
3198 would change the allocation of program funds so that 
increasing amounts are directed toward the state geological 
surveys. Based on information from USGS, however, CBO estimates 
that this change would not affect the rate at which funds are 
spent.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.
    8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: H.R. 3198 contains no intergovernmental mandates 
as defined in Public Law 104-4 and would impose no costs on 
state, local, or tribal governments. This legislation would 
authorize appropriations for the national cooperative geologic 
mapping program, including about $22 million over the next four 
years for grants to states and about $2 million over that 
period for an education component, consisting of grants to 
colleges and universities. The state grant component would 
increase slightly over this period as a proportion of the total 
program. H.R. 3198 also would codify the existing one-to-one 
matching requirement for the education component.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This legislation 
contains no private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: Only July 1, 1996, CBO provided 
an estimate for H.R. 3198, as ordered reported by the House 
Committee on Resources on June 19, 1996. The two versions of 
H.R. 3198 and their estimated costs are the same.
    11. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate--Gary 
Brown; State and Local Government Impact--Marjorie Miller; 
Private-Sector Impact--Patrice Gordon.
    12. Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine (for Paul N. 
Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis).

                      Regulatory Impact Evaluation

    In compliance with paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee makes the following 
evaluation of the regulatory impact which would be incurred in 
carrying out H.R. 3198. The bill is not a regulatory measure in 
the sense of imposing Government established standards or 
significant economic responsibilities on private individuals 
and businesses.
    No personal information would be collected in the 
administering of the program. Therefore, there would be no 
impact on personal privacy.
    Little, if any, additional paperwork would result from 
enactment of H.R. 3198, or ordered reported.

                        Executive Communications

    On September 24, 1996, the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources requested a legislative report from the Department of 
the Interior setting forth executive views on H.R. 3198. This 
report had not been received at the time the report on H.R. 
3198 was filed. When the report becomes available, the Chairman 
will request that it be printed in the Congressional Record for 
the advice of the Senate. The following testimony from the 
administration was provided to the House during that bodies 
hearing:

 Statement of Dr. P. Patrick Leahy, U.S. Geological Survey, Department 
                            of the Interior

    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here today to express the 
Administration's support for H.R. 3198, a bill to reauthorize 
the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992. I appreciate the 
opportunity to review the progress made under the Act since 
1992 and to outline the goals that we are setting through the 
reauthorization legislation.
    The Earth provides the foundation of our society--we live 
upon it and we utilize its products. A thorough knowledge of 
the Earth's resources and dangers is crucial for informed 
decisions in making public policy. Geologic maps are the best 
tools to collect and convey this information. The National 
Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, authorized by the 
National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992, produces geologic maps 
needed by public and private organizations, maps essential to 
our continued economic health and vitality.
    Geologic maps are the keystone of the U.S. Geological 
Survey's mission. They address each of the four principal 
themes of the Survey's mission: information, hazards, 
resources, and the environment. The geologic maps prepared by 
Survey scientists over the past century have been the primary 
means of communicating geologic information and data. In the 
past 100 years, society's needs have risen dramatically and 
have focused the attention of the earth science community on 
processes at and near the Earth's surface. We continue to seek 
and refine information that is essential for the protection of 
human health and safety and for continued economic growth, 
outcomes that can be traced ultimately to high-quality geologic 
maps. Old geologic maps must be revised and updated, and new 
ones prepared. Tight fiscal constraints require that the 
broadest range of stakeholders determine what information is 
needed so that our effort are well targeted. These constraints 
require that all those who prepare geologic maps, within the 
U.S. Geological Survey to State geological surveys and the 
academic community, work cooperatively to maximize each other's 
strengths and to avoid duplication. It is often said that 
cooperative effort of a group can exceed the sum of the 
individual efforts--today, I will outline how activities under 
the National Geologic Mapping Act are applying such a 
cooperative and synergistic approach among the Federal 
Government, the states, and the academic community.
    To the extent possible, humans must be safe from natural 
hazards. Although natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic 
eruptions, landslides and floods cannot be stopped, recognizing 
and planning for these dangers can significantly reduce the 
chances for a major disaster. Geologic maps are the principal 
means for discovering and recording areas that will be affected 
by natural hazards and for communicating the dangers of hazards 
such as earthquake producing faults, landslides, collapse 
structures, expanding soils, volcanic eruptions, and both 
natural and manmade pollution. Identifying the location of 
hazardous areas on maps allows land managers, industry, and the 
public to predict potential losses, develop strategies to 
minimize these losses.
    Human health depends largely on environmental quality. 
Effective environmental policy requires an understanding of the 
complex interrelationships among components of the biosphere, 
including the Earth itself. Geologic maps provide the 
foundation needed to achieve balanced and scientifically 
credible environmental protection. They provide information on 
the location of rock types that produce radon, release toxic 
heavy metals, or interact with water to produce acid drainage. 
They provide the framework to predict flow paths for 
contaminated ground water plumes, to identify safe locations 
for waste sites and other facilities that will minimize the 
chances for pollution of soil and water. They also help to 
delineate specific soil or rock types necessary for certain 
plant communities.
    Economic growth is driven largely by access to the Earth's 
resources. Water, energy, and building materials are required 
to sustain our vital economic engine. Geologic maps provide the 
keys for the location of safe drinking water, energy resources 
such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas; construction 
materials such as sand, gravel limestone, and building stone; 
soil and rock types that enhance agricultural productivity; and 
metals and other mineral resources as diverse as gold, 
fertilizer, and kitty litter (zeolite and vermiculite). Policy 
makers must know the nature and extent of resources in order to 
plan how to manage the land in an economically sustainable way. 
Industry and local governments need geologic maps to help 
estimate the available resources for water supplies, building, 
energy production, and extraction of raw materials.


             national cooperative geologic mapping program


    The national Cooperative Geologic Mapping (NCGM) Program 
ensures that our Nation will continue to have the geologic maps 
it needs to protect the health of our citizens and promote 
economic growth. Through involvement with private industry, 
public policy makers, and the public, the Program seeks to 
ensure that mapping efforts are focused on priority areas. The 
Program also uses stakeholder input to determine what formats 
are most useful as we move into the information age; new 
geologic maps are being produced in digital formats that can be 
put on the Internet.
    The NCGM Program has been designed so that the Nation will 
have the quantitative geologic map data needed to address 
tomorrow's problems. To this end, the following goals are being 
pursued:
          Continue to enhance the outreach to stakeholders thus 
        ensuring that the maps address societal priorities and 
        are produced in forms easily accessible and usable.
          Expand cooperative agreements with the State geologic 
        surveys, academic communities, other Federal agencies, 
        and the private sector to enhance the output of map 
        information and data.
          Develop metadata for the National Geologic Map 
        database and make the data available through the 
        Internet. Enhance the ability to produce digital as 
        well as analog (paper) map products.
    The NCGM Program brings together Earth scientists from the 
U.S. Geological Survey, State geological surveys, and academia 
through a process of partnering. The program will ensure a 
balance of funding between State geological surveys and 
academia. The goals of the academic funding are to ensure that 
we train the scientists who will provide the geologic maps of 
the future.
    The National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992, Public Law 102-
285 authorized the establishment of a National Cooperative 
Geologic Mapping Program with the U.S. Geological Survey as the 
lead Federal agency responsible for coordinating and managing 
the geologic mapping program. The act also state that the 
program is to be implemented through four components: FEDMAP 
and SUPPORTMAP which constitute the Federal component of the 
geologic mapping program, STATEMAP, which supports the States' 
efforts in producing geologic maps, and EDMAP, which ensures 
the training of students in the production of geologic maps. 
The 1992 Act also called for the establishment of a National 
Advisory Committee, the development of a National Geologic Map 
Database, and the development of methods to increase public 
awareness of the role and application of geologic map 
information to the resolution of national issues. Several 
changes in the geologic mapping program have occurred since the 
passage of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 that I am 
pleased to enter into the record:
    1. Program name.--The National Geologic Mapping Program is 
now named the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, a 
small change in the name, but a significant change in 
recognition of the strong partnering aspect of the program with 
the State geological surveys through the Association of 
American State Geologists (AASG), with academia, and with the 
National Park Service and other Federal agencies.
    2. STATEMAP.--In FY 1995 only about 6 percent of total 
program funding was available for matching by State geological 
surveys, whereas in FY 1996 and beyond a minimum of 20 percent 
of appropriated funds will be apportioned to the STATEMAP 
component, thereby significantly increasing the amount of high-
priority geologic mapping required by individual States and the 
Nation. In. FY 1996 cooperative agreements are being made with 
42 States to help support 60 geologic mapping projects. These 
projects were recommended for funding by a peer review panel 
consisting primarily of State Geologist (Exhibit 1).
    3. EDMAP.--This important component of the geologic mapping 
program is being implemented for the first time in FY 1996. Two 
percent of the total program funding is available for matching 
by universities. The funding is to help support graduate 
students to conduct geologic mapping in areas of priority to 
State or Federal agencies. These studies not only help increase 
the geologic mapping of high priority areas but also help train 
the next generation of geologic mappers. In FY 1996 cooperative 
agreements are being made with 37 universities to support 40 
geologic mapping projects recommended for funding by a peer 
review panel consisting primarily of university professors who 
are experts in geologic mapping (Exhibit 1).
    4. FEDMAP/SUPPORTMAP.--The USGS continues to be active in 
executing geologic mapping (FEDMAP) and supporting studies 
(SUPPORTMAP) of paleontology, stratigraphy, geochronology, 
isotope geology, geophysics, and geochemistry. Over the past 
few years the geologic mapping program has moved from large 
numbers of essentially one-person projects to more integrated 
regional synthesis activities in which clients and cooperators 
are involved in all phases of the planning, implementation, and 
execution of project work. For this reason, much of our 
geologic mapping has moved from rural and wilderness areas to 
the ``urban corridor'' and ``urban fringe'' areas, where 
competing land use decisions benefit from improved geologic 
information. Three examples of the twelve regional synthesis 
projects are the Southern California Areal Mapping Project 
(SCAMP), the Middle Rio Grande Basin Project, and the Florida 
Cooperative Geologic Mapping Project.
Southern California Areal Mapping Project (SCAMP)
    This geologic mapping project is centered on the Los 
Angeles urban area and covers most of southwestern California 
(Exhibit 3). This is a joint effort with the California 
Division of Mines and Geology. Clients include the U.S. Air 
Force (March Air Force Base and Edwards Air Force Base), the 
U.S. Navy (Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air/Ground Combat 
Center and the Chocolate Mountains Gunnery Range), the U.S. 
Forest Service (San Bernadino National Forest), U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers (Seven Oaks Dam), National Park Service (Joshua 
Tree National Park), San Bernadino Valley Municipal Water 
Agency (Yucaipa and San Bernadino Basins), Mojave Water Agency 
(Lucerne and Morango Basins and Mojave River), Metropolitan 
Water District, and the Southern California Earthquake Center.
    The components of the project address a variety of urban 
geology issues for which geologic mapping provides essential 
primary data. These are: (1) mapping the geometry of ground 
water basins and flow regimes to assist several California 
water districts in dealing with water resource and recharge 
problems and to help the Air Force monitor contaminant plumes 
in ground water, (2) mapping limestone and aggregate building 
resources to assist the National Forest Service manage its 
land, (3) providing geologic map data to assist the Corps of 
Engineers in siting a dam between two strands of the San 
Andreas fault and (4) helping the Metropolitan Water District 
define the structural setting of the ``Domenigoni'' reservoir, 
now under construction, which when completed will be the 
largest water retention structure in Southern California.
Middle Rio Grande Basin Project
    One of the new cooperative urban-focus projects organized 
within NCGMP in FY 1996 provides a geologic framework and 
geologic map database for investigation of the Middle Rio 
Grande Basin, a region that includes extensive Federal lands as 
well as the principal urban centers of New Mexico. This project 
addresses the critical issue of diminishing ground water supply 
in the rapidly developing Santa Fe-Albuquerque-Socorro urban 
corridor of New Mexico. Previous joint studies by the New 
Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources and USGS have 
shown that the extent of the primary aquifer in the region is 
more limited in size and distribution than previously believed, 
and unless new water resources and identified, urban 
development will be limited (Exhibit 4). NCGMP has joined with 
other USGS Divisions, with area universities, New Mexico Bureau 
of Mines and Mineral Resources, and other federal agencies in a 
5-year effort to better define the hydrology and geology of the 
Middle Rio Grande Basin. As illustrated in Exhibit 4, NCGMP is 
taking the lead in compiling the overall geologic map database 
for the region at 1:100,000-scale and in developing airborne 
geophysical data sets for identifying buried aquifers and 
geologic structures that control ground water flow.
Florida Cooperative Geologic Mapping Project
    This is a cooperative effort with the Florida Geological 
Survey (FGS) to provide surficial and shallow subsurface 
geological mapping in the State of Florida (Exhibit 5). The 
activities of the FGS include primary responsibility for 
surficial geologic mapping, stratigraphic test drilling, and 
analysis and curation of drill core samples. NCGMP provides 
high resolution biostratigraphy and interpretation of the 
ancient environments where sediments were deposited. This joint 
work has established the geologic framework for hydrologic flow 
modeling by the South and Southwest Florida Water Management 
Districts and USGS and has resulted in a re-evaluation the 
stratigraphic setting and flow patterns within the principal 
Floridan aquifers. This cooperative work with the state has 
extended the stratigraphic range (thickness) and defined 
depositional settings where economic deposits of phosphate 
occur in Florida.
    NCGMP has also formed a partnership with the Florida 
Geological Survey, South and Southwest Florida Water Management 
Districts, Dade County, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Everglades National 
Park, and several area universities to investigate the quality 
and quantity of water delivered to both the southeast (Biscayne 
Bay) and south (Florida Bay) coasts of Florida (Exhibit 5). 
Both of these shallow bays are showing increasing signs of 
distress such as algal blooms, seagrass die-offs; fishery 
declines, increases in pollution, and changes in nearshore 
vegetation patterns. It is important to know how many of the 
observed changes are direct consequences of human activity and 
how many are related to natural variations in the ecosystems. 
This project is testing theories about human influence by 
examining the geologic record for the past 300 years and 
examining the ability of the natural systems to recover from 
disturbances. Initial results suggest that there are both man-
induced changes, such as changes in plant distribution related 
to canal-building, as well as natural cycles in seagrass 
abundance and fishery productivity.
    5. External advisory committee.--The U.S. Geological Survey 
sponsored two national workshops, one in December of 1994 and a 
second in February of 1995, to begin the process of soliciting 
advice on the planning and implementation of the geologic 
mapping program. Workshop participants were producers and users 
of geologic map information including representatives from 
Federal and State agencies, academic institutions, and the 
private sector. Just recently, a 16-member National Cooperative 
Geologic Mapping Program Advisory Committee has been chartered 
and appointed. It is scheduled to hold its first meeting April 
25-26, 1996, in Washington, DC.
    6. National geologic map database.--A draft of this 
database design has recently been released for comment via the 
Internet by creating a site on the World Wide Web (WWW). The 
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for this site is ``http://
wwwflag.wr.usgs.gov/ngmdb''. This web site is also linked to 
the recently created web site for the National Cooperative 
Geologic Mapping Program whose URL is ``http://
ncgmp.usgs.gov''. A critical element in database construction 
is the development, acceptance, and adherence to a certain 
level of standardization. The USGS is currently working with 
both producers and users of geologic map information to develop 
draft format, symbols, and technical attribute standards so 
that geologic map database information can be accessed, 
exchanged, and compared efficiently and accurately as required 
by Executive Order 12906 (59 Fed. Reg. 17,671; 1994), which 
established the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).
    7. USGS circular 1111.--``Societal Value of Geologic 
Maps'', published in 1993, is an economic analysis by the 
geologic mapping program that describes geologic maps, a 
rigorous benefit-cost model for valuing geologic map 
information, and the economic issues associated with 
determining whether or not a geologic map is a public good 
(Exhibit 6). Nearly ten thousand copies have been requested 
since publication. This publication and similar studies are 
increasing public awareness of the utility (value in use) of 
geologic map information to issues of land use management.
    8. Federal partnerships.--The geologic mapping program is 
developing a series of cooperative relationships with various 
Federal partners in addition to our State and academic 
cooperators. The most mature of these is with the National Park 
Service (NPS). In 1995, the USGS and NPS signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding that outlined areas of interaction between the 
two agencies. The geologic mapping program responded by working 
with NPS during 1995 as part of their ``Science in the Parks'' 
initiative to direct a portion of the program's geologic 
mapping and supporting activities toward priorities established 
by NPS. The NPS used a national project call and priority 
system to rank over 100 proposals for geologic work in FY 1996. 
The geologic mapping program has begun work in FY 1996 with 10 
of the 30 top-priority parks. The geologic mapping program is 
currently in the process of fostering similar partnerships with 
other Federal agencies including Bureau of Land Management, 
U.S. Forest Service, Environmental Protection Agency, and 
Department of Energy.
    Mr. Chairman, in concluding my remarks, I would like to 
state for the record that the National Geologic Mapping Act of 
1992 has been instrumental in helping focus more attention on 
the Nation's need for a systematic, high-quality geologic map 
database to serve as the primary underpinnings for virtually 
all applied and basic earth science investigations. The 
Administration supports reauthorization and urges bipartisan 
support for this legislation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the 
opportunity to express the views of the U.S. Geological Survey 
on the benefits of the current National Geologic Mapping Act 
and the value of reauthorizing this program. I would be happy 
to respond to any questions you may have.
