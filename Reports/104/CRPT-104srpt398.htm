                    History and Current Jurisdiction

                                history

    Although the Federal Constitution does not even mention 
committees, the committee system was established by the First 
Congress. Our first lawmakers recognized the need for workable 
units to find facts and make policy recommendations, based on 
indepth study and expertise.
    The present committee organization was created in 1977 by 
the ``Committee System Reorganization Amendments of 1977'' (S. 
Res. 4, 95th Cong.). The purpose of S. Res. 4 was to streamline 
the Senate's procedural organization by reorganizing the 
committee jurisdictions as reasonably as possible and within 
the hands of fewer committees.

                          current jurisdiction

    Under Senate Rule XXV(g) the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources extends to--
          all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, 
        memorials, and other matters relating to the following 
        subjects:
                  1. Coal production, distribution, and 
                utilization.
                  2. Energy policy.
                  3. Energy regulation and conservation.
                  4. Energy related aspects of deepwater ports.
                  5. Energy research and development.
                  6. Extraction of minerals from oceans and 
                Outer Continental Shelf lands.
                  7. Hydroelectric power, irrigation, and 
                reclamation.
                  8. Mining education and research.
                  9. Mining, mineral lands, mining claims, and 
                conservation.
                  10. National parks, recreation areas, 
                wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, 
                historical sites, military parks and 
                battlefields, and on the public domain, 
                preservation of pre-historic ruins and objects 
                of interests.
                  11. Naval petroleum reserves in Alaska.
                  12. Nonmilitary development of nuclear 
                energy.
                  13. Oil and gas production and distribution.
                  14. Public lands and forests, including 
                farming and grazing thereon, and mineral 
                extraction therefrom.
                  15. Solar energy systems.
                  16. Territorial possessions of the United 
                States, including trusteeships.
    In the 103d Congress, the Committee had five subcommittees: 
the Subcommittee on Energy and Regulation and Conservation; the 
Subcommittee on Energy Research and Development; the 
Subcommittee on Mineral Resources Development and Production; 
the Subcommittee on Public Lands, National Parks and Forests

responsibilities for the public lands administered by the 
Bureau of Land Management; National Forest System; National 
Park System; National Wilderness Preservation System; Wild and 
Scenic Rivers System; National Trails System; establishment of 
wildlife refuges on public lands; Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act; Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation 
Act; reserved water rights; military land withdrawals; national 
recreation areas; national monuments; historic sites; military 
parks and battlefields; Land and Water Conservation Fund; 
historic preservation; renewable resources; outdoor recreation

water resources; groundwater resources and management; small 
power producers; hydroelectric power; low head hydro.
    In addition, numerous important matters were considered 
directly by the full Committee without initial reference to a 
subcommittee. In addition to Executive nominations, such 
matters include issues that (1) require extremely expeditious 
handling, or (2) substantially overlap two or more subcommittee 
jurisdictions, or (3) are of exceptional national significance 
in which all Members wish to participate fully.

members wish to participate fully.

                                OVERVIEW

Nominations
    During the 103d Congress, 40 nominations were submitted by 
President Clinton and referred to the Committee. Of these, 39 
were reported favorably by the Committee and were confirmed by 
the Senate. One nomination was discharged from the Committee.
Presidential messages
    Four Presidential messages were transmitted to the 
Committee during the 103d Congress.
Executive communications
    The Committee received a total of 291 Executive 
Communications transmitting legislative recommendations and 
relating to the Committee's oversight responsibilities.
Reports and publications
    During the 103d Congress, the full Committee filed 112 
Senate Reports on measures reported by the Committee.
    The Committee also published 111 hearing records. Nineteen 
of those dealt with Presidential appointees, and the remaining 
publications provided background material pertinent to the 
Committee's legislative activities and oversight 
responsibilities.
    In addition, the Committee published two Committee prints. 
They dealt with the Rules, Membership and Jurisdiction of the

of 1992.

                          Oversight Activities

                                 BUDGET

    During the 103d Congress, the full Committee considered the 
President's proposed budgets for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 for 
the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, the 
Forest Service, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
    During the second session of the 103d Congress, the full 
Committee held four days of hearings on the President's budget 
for fiscal year 1995. On February 23, 1994, the Committee heard 
testimony on the proposed budget for the Department of Energy;

    Following its review of the President's budget proposals, 
the Committee submitted its Views and Estimates report to the 
Senate Budget Committee. In general, the Committee concurred in 
the President's overall budget totals for the agencies under 
the Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee noted its 
disagreement, however, with some of the Administration's 
proposals for fundamental changes in priorities among 
Department of Energy programs, and expressed its concern over 
the Administration's request for funds for ambitious, long-term 
scientific projects that neither Congress nor the 
Administration has committed to see through to completion.

                                 BUDGET

    The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 
1994 (H. Con. Res. 64) contained budget reconciliation 
instructions directing the Committee to report changes in laws 
within the Committee's jurisdiction to reduce the deficit $118 
million in fiscal year 1994 and $737 million for the five-year 
period of fiscal years 1994 through 1998.
    In compliance with these reconciliation instructions, the 
Committee reported to the Senate Budget Committee legislation 
to collect additional recreational and commercial fees for the 
use of national parks and public lands; to impose new hardrock 
mining claim maintenance fees; to lower financial assistance 
payments to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; 
and to reduce outlays for the costs of administering the 
mineral receipts program. The Congressional Budget Office 
estimated that these measures would reduce outlays by $119 
million in fiscal year 1994 and by $749 million for the five-
year period of fiscal years 1994 through 1998.
    The Committee's recommendations were passed by the Senate 
but later modified in conference. As enacted, the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66) reduced 
federal outlays by an estimated $660 million over the five-year 
period of fiscal years 1994 through 1998 by increasing 
recreational and commercial user fees, increasing hardrock 
mining fees, and deducting part of the cost of mineral royalty 
collection program from the royalties otherwise paid to the 
states.
    The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 
1995 (H. Con. Res. 218) did not contain reconciliation 
instructions for the Committee and no budget reconciliation 
legislation was reported by the Committee during the second 
session of the 103d Congress.
Department of Energy national laboratories
    The full Committee held three days of hearings on S. 473, 
the Department of Energy National Competitiveness Technology 
Partnership Act of 1994 on March 18, 23, and 24, 1993 (S. Hrg. 
103-70). The full Committee reported S. 473 on June 24, 1993 
(S. Rept. 103-69). The Senate passed S. 473 on November 20, 
1993. S. 473 was referred jointly to the House Committees on 
Armed Services; Energy and Commerce; and Science Space and 
Technology. The House Energy and Commerce Committee reported S. 
473 on July 19, 1994 (H. Rept. 103-611).
    The Senate added provisions of S. 473 to S. 1298, the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, on 
September 9, 1993, but they were subsequently dropped in 
conference. The Senate also added the text of S. 473 to S. 
2251, which passed the Senate on September 30, 1994 but was not 
enacted.
Petroleum Marketing Practice Act
    On February 25, 1993, the full Committee held a hearing on

Rept. 103-62). The Senate passed S. 646 on June 29, 1993. S. 
646 was referred jointly to the House Committees on Foreign 
Affairs; Energy and Commerce; and Science, Space and 
Technology. The House passed H.R. 4908, the Hydrogen, Fusion, 
and High Energy and Nuclear Physics Research Act of 1994 on 
August 19, 1994. This version of the fusion legislation was 
sufficiently incompatible with the Senate bill that no further 
action was taken in the 103d Congress.
Ward Valley land transfer
    On July 19, 1994, the full Committee held a hearing on S. 
2151, the Ward Valley Land Transfer Act, a bill to require the 
Secretary of the Interior to transfer 1,000 acres of public 
land in San Bernardino County, California to the State of 
California for purposes of the Southwestern Low-Level 
Radioactive Waste Compact's low-level waste repository. The 
Committee took no further action on the bill during the 103d 
Congress.
Emergency Energy Policy
    The full Committee held a hearing on S. 2032, the Emergency 
Petroleum Supply Act, and a draft Administration proposal to 
amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) on May 24, 
1994 (S. Hrg. 103-674). S. 2251, to reauthorize and amend the 
EPCA to manage the strategic petroleum reserve more effectively 
and for other purposes, introduced by request for the 
Administration, was reported by the Committee with an amendment 
in the nature of a substitute on Aug. 12, 1994 (S. Rept. 103-
334). The Senate passed S. 2251 as a Committee amendment in the 
nature of a substitute. Differences between the House passed 
bill, H.R. 4752, and S. 2251 were irreconcilable.
    S. 2466, a simple extension of the program authorizations 
under EPCA, was introduced on Sept. 27, 1994 and discharged 
from the Committee and passed by the Senate without amendment 
on Sept. 30, 1994. S. 2466 passed the House on October 7, 1994. 
The bill was signed into law on October 22, 1994 (P.L. 103-
406).

    During the 103d Congress, 6 Senate bills and 2 House bills 
were referred to the Subcommittee. Those measures upon which 
major action was taken are discussed below.

Mining law reform

    During the 103d Congress, the Subcommittee spent much time 
and effort considering legislation to reform the Mining Law of 
1872. On March 16, 1993, the Subcommittee conducted a hearing 
on S. 257, legislation introduced by Senator Bumpers and others 
that would comprehensively reform existing law governing the 
mining of minerals such as gold, silver and copper on Federal 
lands. The Subcommittee also conducted hearings on a mining law 
reform proposal introduced by Senator Craig and others on May 
4, 1993 (S. 775). The Committee subsequently reported this 
measure and it later passed the Senate without amendment.
    The House also had several mining reform proposals under 
consideration, most notably, H.R. 332 introduced by Congressman 
Rahall and others. The House passed this measure on November 
18, 1993. Subsequent to that action, the House substituted the 
text of the House approved measure for the text of S. 775 and 
sent it back to the Senate.
    Several formal and informal meetings of the conferees and 
staff were held throughout the summer of 1994 in an effort to 
resolve the differences between the two versions. No final 
agreement could be reached and the 103d Congress adjourned 
without enacting a mining law reform bill.

Stock Raising Homestead Act

    On March 17, 1993, the Committee favorably reported S. 336, 
a bill to amend the Stock Raising Homestead Act to resolve 
certain problems regarding subsurface estates, introduced by 
Senator Bingaman. The Stock Raising Homestead Act governs 
mining on lands where the surface has been patented into 
private ownership for stock raising purposes and the Federal 
Government owns the mineral estate. On March 30, 1993, the 
House passed its version of the bill, H.R. 239. The Senate 
passed the House bill two days later and the President signed 
it into law on April 16 (P.L. 103-23).

Naval Oil Shale Reserves--Oil and gas leasing

    On October 14, 1993, the Subcommittee conducted a hearing 
on S. 1170 introduced by Senator Campbell. This bill would 
authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue oil and gas 
leases in two Naval Oil Shale Reserves in Colorado in a effort 
to prevent drainage of public oil and gas resources resulting 
from the drilling of numerous wells on private lands adjacent 
to the Reserve areas. The Committee favorably reported this 
measure on July 11, 1994, but no further action was taken.

Geothermal development outside of Yellowstone National Park

    On March 16, 1994, the Subcommittee held a joint hearing 
with the Subcommittee on Public Lands, National Parks and 
Forests to consider H.R. 1137, legislation introduced by 
Congressman Williams of Montana, to amend the Geothermal Steam 
Act of 1970 to prohibit leasing and development on lands 
outside Yellowstone National Park. This legislation was 
subsequently reported from the Committee to the Senate, with 
amendments, but was not considered further by the full Senate.

Guam excess lands

    On February 3, 1994, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
H.R. 2144, a bill to provide for the transfer of excess land to 
the Government of Guam. This legislation would transfer, 
without cost, approximately 3,200 acres of excess Federal land 
to the Government of Guam for public benefit use. Under 
existing law, most of these lands would have to be sold to the 
highest bidder and would likely not be available for the 
enjoyment and use of the people of Guam.
    This legislation was reported favorably from the Committee 
on June 24, 1994, without amendment, but no further action was 
taken by the Senate.

                       MEASURES ENACTED INTO LAW

legislation introduced by Senator Johnston and others (S. 991)

Illinois, Tennessee and Kentucky, which taken together comprise 
the poorest region of the United States. These proposals were 
drawn from the recommendations in a 1990 report prepared by the
