                                                   January 2, 1997.
Hon. Robin H. Carle,
Clerk of the House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Robin: Pursuant to Clause 1(d) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, I hereby submit to the House a 
report on the activities of the Committee on House Oversight 
for the 104th Congress, including the Oversight Plan for the 
104th Congress.
    With best wishes,
            Sincerely,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
    Attachment.


                     Establishment of the Committee

    The Committee was created on January 4, 1995, and is 
successor to the Committee on House Administration, which was 
created on January 2, 1947 as part of the Legislative 
Reorganization Act of 1946. This Act combined the Committee on 
Accounts, Enrolled Bills, Disposition of Executive Papers, 
Printing, Election, Election of the President, Vice President, 
and Representatives in Congress, and Memorials. Between January 
2, 1947 and January 4, 1995, the jurisdiction of the Committee 
was amended to include the House Restaurant System, parking 
facilities, House Beauty Shop, campaign contributions to 
candidates for the House, resolutions authorizing committees to 
employ additional professional and clerical personnel, and the 
Committee shared jurisdiction with the Post Office and Civil 
Service Committee on matters relating to compensation, 
retirement and other benefits of Members, officers and 
employees of Congress.
    Upon adoption of the Rules of the House of Representatives 
for the 104th Congress, the Committee responsibility for 
authorizing payment of expenses was expanded to include all 
staff salaries for any committee, commission, or other entity 
(except the Committee on Appropriations) for a Congress. The 
Committee's jurisdiction was also broadened, as a result of the 
elimination of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, to 
include the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards. 
Responsibility for erection of monuments to the memory of 
individuals was transferred to the Committee on Resources. In 
the 104th Congress, there were no subcommittees.

   Mr. Thomas, from the Committee on House Oversight, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

REPORT ON THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOUSE OVERSIGHT DURING THE 
                             104TH CONGRESS

                  Summary of 104th Congress Activities

    The Committee on House Oversight conducted its work in the 
104th Congress according to a philosophy and mandate wholly 
different from that of its predecessor committee, the Committee 
on House Administration. As the monthly listing of activities 
and committee actions show, the Committee's role was one of 
oversight, not administrative management, of House operations. 
Responsibility for setting and overseeing policy remained with 
the Committee, but the Officers of the House were charged with 
the implementation of those policies. Further, the Committee 
achieved its goals of transforming this to an ``Open House,'' 
improving the extent and timeliness of information about those 
areas in the Committee's jurisdiction to the public, and of 
reducing costs while maintaining necessary services for all 
House offices.

                  Member Allowances and House Accounts

    Under its jurisdictional responsibility for accounts of the 
House, including Member allowances, the Committee instituted a 
``no exceptions'' policy, ensuring that the regulations, as 
written, were enforced and that all members of the House were 
treated equitably. In order to provide further support for 
Member offices, the Committee spent six months reviewing and 
then rewriting the ``Congressional Handbook.'' The resultant 
``Members Congressional Handbook'' adopted unanimously by the 
Committee in August, 1995, consists of concise, clear 
regulations to which no exceptions are issued, and which 
provide Members of the House with the flexibility, authority 
and responsibility to determine how best they can serve their 
constituents without enduring the ``Committee knows best'' 
patriarchy that previously existed. The Committee also 
instituted a policy in which no verbal modifications or 
interpretations of regulations were permitted; any changes or 
clarification were documented in written memoranda to the House 
Finance Office, with copies provided to the Minority.
    In 1995, the Committee also unanimously approved 
consolidation of the three previous allowances (Clerk Hire, 
Official Expense and Official Mail) into one ``Members 
Representational Allowance'' providing Member offices with 
greater flexibility in managing their office budgets. The limit 
of the Official Mail Allowance, which was reduced by one-third 
in 1995, was retained but Members were allowed, under the new 
MRA structure, to spend funds not utilized for mail on other 
official expenses.
    The Committee served as an invaluable resource to Member 
offices, who routinely seek information and advice to ensure 
appropriate use of their official funds. During the 104th 
Congress, the Committee received and responded to an average of 
300 phone calls per week, or over 8,000 calls during the two 
year period, from staff and Members.
    In implementing the first public law of the 104th Congress, 
the Congressional Accountability Act which applies employment 
laws to the Congress, the Committee played a primary role. It 
reviewed proposed regulations proposed by the Office of 
Compliance, and resolutions adopting regulations were approved 
by the House. The Committee provided advice and counsel to all 
House offices on the impact of the Act, including holding 
numerous seminars to provide detailed explanations.
    The Committee implemented the first ever biennial committee 
funding process, saving over $60 million in taxpayer dollars 
through reduced committee funding levels and mandating \1/3\ 
fewer House committee staff, abolishing over 600 positions. By 
consolidating disparate committee funding sources into one 
account, the Committee instituted full public disclosure of the 
costs of committee operations for the first time.

                    house administrative operations

    The Committee began the 104th Congress with a new structure 
for administrative operations. The Office of the Doorkeeper was 
eliminated, and its primary functions transferred to the 
Sergeant at Arms.
    A new office, the Chief Administrative Officer, was created 
to manage operations previously held by the Director of Non-
legislative and Financial Services. The Clerk of the House 
maintained the historic role of support for legislative and 
floor activities, and has in the 104th Congress begun the 
difficult but important task of migrating House documents from 
printed to electronic form.
    During the historic transition period between the 103rd and 
104th Congress, a ``Transition Team'' drafted a plan and 
structure which served as the blueprint for the many reforms 
the Committee successfully implemented during the 104th. Among 
these reforms were the privatization of House operations, 
including the House Beauty Shop, Barber Shop, Postal windows, 
Postal operations and shoe shine service. A standardized 
process for fair and open procurement and bidding was 
instituted, ensuring that the most competitive offer would win 
the House' business. Overall, reforms implemented by the 
Committee have resulted in over $140,000,000 in savings. What 
was commonly known as the Folding Room was closed in August of 
1995, and the House now uses private mailing houses, at 
standard market rates, for its mailing services. A private 
contractor operates a House-owned parking lot, adjacent to the 
Capitol grounds, which is open to the public, and revenues from 
that parking lot go directly to the Treasury for deficit 
reduction. The Committee also directed the Architect of the 
Capitol to halt daily delivery of ice-filled buckets to House 
offices, a practice that wasted $500,000 annually.
    In the transformation from the ``administration'' to the 
``oversight'' committee, the Committee delegated authority to 
the House Officers. Because duplication ended and efficiencies 
were gained, the Committee reduced its own staff by over 40% 
from 103rd Congress levels and over 600 positions were 
eliminated in administrative operations. For example, the 
predecessor committee reviewed, on average, over 18,000 
vouchers per month, which were then reviewed a second time by 
the House Finance office. The Committee on House Oversight 
delegated voucher review authority to the Chief Administrative 
Officer, resulting in greater efficiency and effectiveness for 
all House offices.
    In addition to accomplishing reform of internal operations, 
the Committee implemented the commitment to a more ``open'' 
House. In 1995, the first-ever independent financial and 
operational audit of the House was conducted under the 
authority of the House Inspector General. This practice, of a 
transparent and open financial statement issued by the people's 
House continued in the second session and is planned for each 
subsequent year. The Committee ordered more disclosure of 
information, including making all mass-mailings available to 
the public for photocopying and making the amount of each 
members' Allowance publicly available.
    After adopting these reforms, the Committee conducted an 
exhaustive survey of public laws applicable to the Committee, 
House Officers and administrative functions of the House. The 
result was the Administrative Reform Technical Corrections Act 
(PL 104-186) which clarified, changed or repealed over 250 
ambiguous or unnecessary statutes.

                technology and electronic communications

    Greater emphasis on utilization of new technologies was a 
hallmark of the Committee's work in the 104th. A Computer 
Information and Services Working Group was formed from the 
Committee membership and enormous time and resources were 
dedicated to assessing options and deciding on a standard 
platform and messaging system upon which the House can build 
21st Century systems. This effort was in addition to work with 
the Library of Congress and the U.S. Senate to implement the 
THOMAS system, providing legislative information to the public, 
on-line and in a timely fashion, and to work towards a common 
solution across all legislative branch entities for the 
transfer and publication of information in electronic form.
    The Committee adopted regulations governing the committee 
and member use of informational pages on the World Wide Web, to 
provide guidance to Member offices and to provide incentives 
for the House to use this new tool for communication with the 
public.
    The Committee also approved the Clerk's plan to implement a 
Document Management System, to install the infrastructure and 
technology necessary for committees and other House offices to 
make legislative and other information, previously only 
available in printed form, available electronically.

                         legislative activities

    The Committee exercised active oversight of other entities 
within its jurisdiction, the Library of Congress, the 
Smithsonian Institution and the Government Printing Office. 
Hearings were held, legislation reported and issues examined 
which lay the groundwork to ensure prudent use of taxpayer 
funds in these operations in the future.
    A new standard for the dismissal of contested elections was 
established by the Committee, requiring that credible 
allegations of fraud or irregularities likely to change the 
outcome of an election should prevent dismissal of a contested 
election. This standard provides greater fairness to 
challengers, more rights to the minority party and preserves 
the original intent of the Federal Contested Election Act--to 
promote and ensure honest elections.
    The operations of the Federal Election Commission were 
examined, and authorized, with specific directions to increase 
funding of computerization which is necessary to accomplish the 
goals of greater and more timely disclosure to the public of 
campaign contributions and expenses. The Committee passed and 
the President signed a measure which requires the Federal 
Elections Committee to permit electronic filing of campaign 
reports beginning in 1997.
    A series of hearings were held to examine the myriad and 
complex issues of financing federal campaigns, resulting in 
campaign finance reform legislation which was considered by the 
House and robustly debated throughout the country.
    As an appendix to this report, a sample of formal 
announcements and Dear Colleague letters sent to House members, 
announcing the Committee's progress and changes during the 
104th Congress, are attached.

                 Oversight Plan for the 104th Congress

    Pursuant to House Rule X, clause 2(d)(1), the Committee on

      Very Important Notice Regarding 1995 Expense Reimbursements

          Distribute to AAs and Office Managers as necessary!

    Dear Colleague: One of the primary charges of the Committee 
on House Oversight is the overhaul of the sometimes confusing 
and contradictory regulations in The Congressional Handbook. A 
new, clearer system will be unveiled early in 1995 which will 
reduce voucher processing time and will provide Members with 
greater authority to manage their offices. There will also be 
timely public disclosure under the new system, which will 
affect all House entities, including Leadership, Committees, 
Member Offices and House Officers.
    A review and overhaul of the current system is needed 
because past Committee on House Administration practice has 
been bureaucratic and slow. We heard Members' complaints that 
their ability to make decisions was limited by arbitrary 
regulations. Members are personally responsible for the 
expenditure of funds from their allowances, and Republicans 
believe that, with this responsibility, should also come 
authority. The authority should not rest in Committee staff or 
solely with the Chairman.
    The Committee will continue to provide advice and guidance 
during and after the transition to the new system and, as 
needed, under a streamlined clearer set of regulations. The 
Committee has established the ``Office of Member Services'' 
specifically to be your resource in managing your offices. Call 
the Committee at our new offices in 1309 Longworth HOB, (phone 
x5-8281) for counsel or help with any expense reimbursement 
issue.
    Our goal is a streamlined process in which the Finance 
Office audits and processes reimbursement requests, and the 
Committee provides advice and guidance. The process of paying 
your bills will become easier and more efficient.
    Equipment procurement, including the ``equipment approved 
list,'' is another area which the Committee is reviewing. We 
plan to implement a new procurement process, which will reduce 
costs and allow greater flexibility, before the end of March. 
Until then, the current system, as outlined in The 
Congressional Handbook, will not change.
    The information on the reverse of this page is critical for 
managing this transition.
    Again, please contact the ``Office of Member Services'' at 
the Committee on House Oversight, 1309 Longworth, x5-8281, with 
any questions or for more information.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman-designate, 
                                               Committee on House 
                                               Oversight.
                                   Jim Nussle,
                                           Chairman, Transition Team.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, January 20, 1995.

                       Accrued Leave Information

    Dear Colleague: On Tuesday, January 17th the House passed 
H. Res. 35 to allow Members to pay accrued annual leave, in one 
lump sum payment, to eligible employees whose employment ends 
between December 31, 1994 and June 30, 1995.
    The following are important procedural notes for Members on 
how to apply H. Res. 35 to your offices.
          The accrued leave resolution does not apply to 
        personal staff terminated during the 103d Congress, nor 
        does it apply to those personal office staff who lost 
        their positions because a Member was not re-elected in 
        November or retired at the end of the 103d Congress.
          Members are the ``employing authority'' for all staff 
        in their offices and, as such, determine accrued leave 
        policy, salaries and employment terms for these 
        employees.
          The resolution will allow a Member to pay accrued 
        annual leave for up to 30 days, according to his/her 
        office policy, to an employee who is terminated (during 
        the dates indicated above), in one lump sum payment.
          Members may pay this sum by sending a letter, 
        indicating the employee's name, social security number, 
        number of days (no more than 30) and applicable rate of 
        pay directed to the Finance Office (263 Cannon HOB). 
        This information must be provided to the Finance Office 
        at the same time the payroll authorization form, 
        terminating the employee, is submitted. The Committee 
        on House Oversight does not review this paperwork!
          As with salaries for Clerk Hire staff, payments for 
        accrued annual leave will be debited from a Member's 
        1995 Clerk Hire Allowance.
          Any employee rehired within the Legislative Branch 
        within 30 days of termination must repay any accrued 
        annual leave payment to the Finance Office.
    The process and paperwork for committee staff is different. 
Staff Directors have been informed in a separate communication 
on the procedures for committee staff.
    If you have any questions, please contact your payroll 
counselor at the Finance Office or Dan Crowley at Committee 
Majority staff (x5-8281) or Committee Minority staff (x5-2016)
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, February 3, 1995.

                      Congressional Accountability

Members, the Resident Commissioner, Delegates, Committee Chairmen, and 
    House Officers,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: On January 23, 1995, the President signed 
the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-
1). The Act establishes an Office of Compliance which will 
issue specific regulations, and which will carry out a program 
to educate congressional offices.
    Congress fails under the laws made applicable by the 
Congressional Accountability Act according to the schedule 
shown below. In the interim, there is no change in the manner 
in which the workplace laws which currently apply to the House 
(Americans with Disabilities Act, Civil Rights Act, Fair Labor 
Standards Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, and the non-
discrimination provisions in House Rule XLIII Sec. 9 and House 
Rule LI) are enforced and the existing House Office of Fair 
Employment Practices will continue to resolve employee 
grievances.
    As of January 23, 1996, House Offices will be accountable 
under the following laws:
          Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.
          Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Equal 
        Employment Opportunities).
          The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (other 
        than public service and accommodations provisions).
          The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 
        (Over 40 years old).
          The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
          The Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988.
          Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act 
        (Notice of mass layoffs).
          The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Affirmative action 
        for handicapped).
          Veterans' Reemployment Rights (Chapter 43 of title 38 
        U.S.C.).
          As of October 1, 1996, House Offices will be 
        accountable under the following law:
          Federal Labor-Management Relations (Chapter 71 of 
        title 5 U.S.C.).
    As of January 1, 1997, House Offices will be accountable 
under the following laws:
          The public service and accommodations provisions of 
        the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
          The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.
    Contact Dan Crowley of the Committee staff at x58281, or 
Minority Committee staff at x52061, for additional information.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, February 9, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: On February 3, 1995, the Federal Election 
Commission (FEC) transmitted the regulations that restrict the 
personal use of campaign funds, with their explanation and 
justification to the House of Representatives and the Senate.
    Following a 30 legislative day waiting period, the FEC will 
announce a date on which the regulations will actually go into 
effect. That effective date may well be only a few days after 
the conclusion of the 30 legislative day waiting period.
    The new regulations are based on Section 439a of the 
Federal Election Campaign Act which limits the use of a 
candidate's contributions in excess of amounts necessary for 
the candidate's expenditures.
    The language of the FEC's final regulations, and the 
``Explanation and Justification,'' that provide more detail, 
are available from the FEC or the Committee on House Oversight. 
If you have any questions, contact the FEC directly or call 
Roman Buhler or Chris Wright at the Committee on House 
Oversight at 225-8281.
            Best regards,
                                               Bill Thomas,
                            Chairman, Committee on House Oversight.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, February 10, 1995.

             Congressional Member Organization Regulations

    Dear Colleague: At our regular monthly meeting last 
Wednesday, February 8, the Committee on House Oversight adopted 
the attached regulations for the operation of Congressional 
Member Organizations (CMOs). We know that many members have 
responded to the elimination of LSOs by organizing informal 
Member organizations to pursue common legislative goals, and 
these CMO regulations are intended to help Members in that 
effort and to provide clear guidance as to what is and is not 
permissible.
    Please note that these regulations replace any previous 
draft or version you may have reviewed. The Committee worked on 
a bipartisan basis throughout January to address Members' 
concerns, and we are proud of the end result, which is 
attached.
    A few key points:
          CMOs must register with the Committee on House 
        Oversight by March 1, 1995. The specifics of ``what'' a 
        CMO is, and the information we ask you to provide is in 
        the regulations.
          In accordance with the current regulations in the 
        Congressional Handbook, Members may share official 
        resources, including staff and equipment, according to 
        the specifics in the regulations.
          A Member may communicate information about a CMO 
        under his or her frank, or through Inside Mail, 
        according to the specifics in the regulations.
    We suggest that you take a few moments and read through 
these regulations carefully. If you have further questions, 
contact the majority office (x58281) or the minority office 
(x52016).
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.

 committee on house oversight--congressional member organization (cmo) 
                              regulations

Authority

    The Committee on House Oversight (``Committee'') has 
jurisdiction over the utilization of Members' official 
allowances and official resources. In accordance with that 
jurisdiction, the Committee issues the following regulations 
for CMOs. Members are advised to contact the Committee on House 
Oversight, the Franking Commission and the Office of Advice and 
Education of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct for 
information and guidance.

Definition

    Members of Congress who wish to join together, in order to 
share official resources in pursuit of common legislative and 
research objectives, must register with the Committee on House 
Oversight as a Congressional Member Organization (CMO).
    A CMO is an informal organization of Members who share 
official resources to jointly carry out activities. CMOs have 
no separate corporate or legal identity apart from the Members 
who comprise it.
    Members may not utilize their official resources to support 
the activities of a CMO as an independent, stand-alone, or 
separate entity. A CMO is not an employing authority, and no 
staff may be appointed by, or in the name of, a CMO. A CMO may 
not be assigned separate office space.

A. Registration with the Committee on House Oversight

    1. CMO activities must be conducted in accordance with 
House Ethics rules as set forth in the House Ethics Manual 
issued April 1992. The Ethics manual section (pages 310-311) 
regarding Legislative Service Organizations (``LSOs'') is 
specifically not applicable to CMOs.
    2. CMOs must register with the Committee, and upon 
registration, provide the following information which will be 
made available to the public during office hours at the 
Committee office in 1309 Longworth HOB, and will be available 
for dissemination on the Internet:
          a. Name of the CMO;
          b. A statement of the purpose of the CMO;
          c. The officers and titles of the CMO, name(s) of 
        designated staff who will work on CMO issues.
    In the 104th Congress, existing CMOs must provide this 
information by March 1, 1995. Newly formed CMOs must also 
provide the above information to the Committee as soon as 
practicable after organization.
    3. CMOs shall provide updated information to the Committee 
regarding a change in officers, or designated staff, or a 
significant change in its purpose, or of its dissolution.

B. Membership of a CMO

    1. Only Members, Delegates and the Resident Commissioner of 
Congress may be members of a CMO.

C. Funding and provision of resources

    1. In accordance with House Rule 45, neither a CMO nor its 
individual members or designated staff may accept funds or 
resources from outside organizations or individuals to support 
the operations of the CMO. Members may (but staff may not) 
utilize personal funds to support the activities of a CMO.
    2. No pooling of resources, except as stated below, or 
contributions from Members official expenses allowances may be 
used to support a CMO as an independent, stand-alone or 
separate entity.
    3. No CMO may establish or utilize separate office space 
nor identify itself as an independent operation or office 
dedicated solely to the functions and operations of the CMO.
    4. A member of a CMO, in support of the objectives of that 
CMO, may utilize Clerk Hire staff and other resources under the 
control of the Member to assist the CMO in carrying out its 
legislative goals and objectives.
    Accordingly, two or more Members may aggregate clerk hire 
resources to fund one or more staff positions to perform 
research and other duties in support of the CMO. Shared 
employees must work out of the office of an employing Member, 
but are not required to work in each employing Member's office. 
A CMO is not an employing authority and no staff may be hired, 
appointed or employed by, or in the name of, a CMO.
    5. Members may utilize House meeting rooms, as available, 
for meetings and gatherings in the name of a CMO, provided that 
any such meeting is conducted within the guidelines of House 
Rule 45 and all other applicable provisions of the House 
Ethics.

D. Communications and mailings

    1. CMOs are not entitled to the use of the frank, nor may a 
Member lend his/her frank to a CMO. A Member may communicate, 
under his/her frank, information about a CMOs activities or 
solicit members for a CMO. A Member may also use ``Inside 
Mail'' for such communications.
    Any references to a CMO in a Member's correspondence must 
relate to a Member's official and representational duties and, 
when such correspondence is issued through the U.S. Postal 
Service, must comply with franking statutes and regulations. A 
CMO may not use official funds to print or pay for a separate 
masthead or letterhead for the CMO. While a Member may use 
personal funds to print or purchase stationery for the CMO, 
personal funds must also be used to mail such stationery.
    3. As part of his/her official correspondence under his/her 
frank and utilizing official equipment (such as computer or 
fax), a Member may distribute frankable announcements, reports, 
analysis, or research on issues directly related to a CMO 
statement of purpose as indicated in its registration with the 
Committee. These materials may indicate that they were prepared 
by, or on behalf of, a CMO. However, the materials may not 
contain a separate address identified as that of the CMO.
    5. A Member may refer to his/her membership in a CMO on 
his/her official stationery letterhead.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, February 13, 1995.

                  Subscription and Publication Policy

    Dear Colleague: On Wednesday, February 8, 1995, the 
Committee on House Oversight adopted the policy shown on the 
reverse of this page regarding reimbursement for payments of 
publications and subscriptions from Member's Official Expenses 
Allowance.
    During the Committee's discussion, the majority and 
minority agreed to work on a bipartisan basis to define and 
clarify the policy, and we will honor that commitment. However, 
the policy will remain as approved on February 8 until any 
changes are agreed to by the Committee. Members will, of 
course, receive notification of any such changes. The Finance 
Office will not approve payment of vouchers without review of 
the information specified in the policy.
    This policy is not intended to interfere with the ability 
of Members to receive needed information in order to carry out 
legislative duties, and to suggest such an intent is a 
misstatement of fact. Rather, the Majority members of the 
Committee believe strongly in the fundamental principle that 
over $600,000 of taxpayer funds should not be used for the 
start-up costs of any organization, whether profit or not-for-
profit. And taxpayer funds should certainly not be used to pay 
to turn on the printing presses for the first run of any 
publication.
    If you have additional questions, please contact the 
Committee Staff Director, Stacy Carlson at x58281, or minority 
staff at x52061.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.

committee on house oversight: policy for subscriptions and publications

Fundamental principles and background information

    (1) Section 222, H. Res. 6 adopting the Rules of the House 
for the 104th Congress, agreed to by the House on January 4, 
1995 provided:

          The establishment or continuation of any legislative 
        service organization (as defined and authorized in the 
        103d Congress) shall be prohibited in the 104th 
        Congress. The Committee on House Oversight shall take 
        such steps as are necessary to ensure an orderly 
        termination and accounting for funds of any legislative 
        service organization in existence on January 3, 1995.

    The House spoke very clearly on January 4 that the form and 
structure of LSOs is unacceptable. Therefore, the Committee 
will look very carefully at requests for payment from Members' 
allowances to ensure that taxpayer funds are not used to 
support, indirectly, a structure or organization which the 
House has clearly stated it does not support directly.
    (2) The Congressional Handbook prohibits the use of 
Member's official allowances to ``defray any personal, 
political or campaign expenses.'' The long-standing practice by 
the Committee on House Administration was to interpret this 
prohibition as excluding as allowable expenses for any 
publication, subscription, directory or other materials which 
were political in nature, including materials which have a 
political party name in its title. For example: ``Republican 
Faxwire'' and ``Illinois Politics'' subscriptions were denied 
in 1993.
    (3) Taxpayer funds should not be used to subsidize the 
``start up'' or organizational costs of any entity described as 
``private,'' whether it is a for-profit or non-profit entity. 
Taxpayer funds may be used to purchase publications or research 
material which have a market demand, based on some objective 
criteria other than just to Members of Congress, i.e. funds 
should only be paid to an entity which is a viable, ongoing, 
self-sustaining organization absent the payment of funds from 
Member's official allowances.

Specific policy

    Therefore, based on these principles, prior to approval of 
payment for a subscription or publication in excess of $500 per 
year, from an organization which has not been in existence, in 
its current form, for at least one year, the Finance Office 
must examine written documents demonstrating that:
          1. The publication is not political in nature, or;
          2. The organization and/or corporation publishing the 
        information provides financial information which shows 
        that its start-up operations are not primarily funded 
        by taxpayer funds provided through payment of Member 
        vouchers, and that it is self-sustaining prior to any 
        payment of these vouchers, and;
          3. The publication has a refund policy which would 
        refund to the Member's expenses allowances, on a pro-
        rata basis, funds paid for issues/information not 
        received in the event the publication ceases operations 
        prior to the end of the subscription period.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, February 15, 1995.

                   Another Contract Promise Fulfilled

    Dear Republican Colleague: Once again we have delivered on 
a major component of the House Republican Contract with 
America.
    The House Inspector General has selected the accounting 
firm Price Waterhouse to conduct the comprehensive audit of 
House finances and operations that Republicans promised on the 
opening day of the 104th Congress.
    An independent, private-sector auditor was specifically 
chosen to avoid partisanship in this endeavor. The Ranking 
Minority Member of the House Oversight Committee has been 
simultaneously informed every step of the way.
    As the only contractor to bid on all twelve sections of the 
audit, and the least expensive on each, Price Waterhouse was 
the clear choice.
    The twelve components of our contract with Price Waterhouse 
include a financial audit; a survey of the services performed 
for the House by the Architect of the Capitol; and performance 
evaluations of the following operations: finance, sales, 
inventory systems, accounts payable systems, contract 
administration, computer security, financial management, short- 
and long-term planning, the ADABAS database system, and House 
Information Systems. A fact sheet with further details is 
attached.
    The audit will be completed and the results released in 
June, with an estimated cost of no more than $3.7 million.
    In the meantime, please be patient as we wait for the 
auditors to do their work. We'll keep you posted on their 
progress.
            Sincerely,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.

                    house audit contract fact sheet

    This represents one more promise kept from the Republican 
Contract with America.
    On the first day of the historic 104th session, we set this 
process in motion.
    Today's announcement demonstrates that we are committed to 
moving forward.

The Chronology

    January 11.--the Oversight Committee approved use of GAO's 
task order contract.
    January 24.--task orders were given to the five firms on 
GAO's contract
    February 7.--proposes were due from those firms
    February 10.--the Inspector General informed Oversight 
Committee of his selection of Price Waterhouse
    June 2.--reports are due to the Inspector General from 
Price Waterhouse
    June 30.--release of audits to the public. Other audits may 
follow.
    The decision to bring in an independent, outside auditor, 
and to have the firm chosen by the Inspector General, was 
specifically made to avoid any taint of partisanship in this 
endeavor. Mr. Lainhart was appointed by Speaker Foley, Rep. 
Gephardt and Rep. Michel in the 103rd Congress and continues to 
serve in a nonpartisan role. Ranking Minority Member Vic Fazio 
has been informed every step of the way.
    Price Waterhouse was chosen for three major reasons:
          (1) They were the only firm to bid on all 12 
        components of the overall audit
          (2) The proposals on all 12 components were equal to 
        or better than their competitors
          (3) They were the most economical on all 12 
        components

The twelve components of the overall audit are:

    (1) A financial audit of cash flows and reconciliation to 
budget reports
    (2) A survey of the services performed for the House by the 
Architect of the Capitol
            Performance evaluations of the following operations:
    (3) finance
    (4) sales
    (5) inventory systems
    (6) accounts payable systems
    (7) contract administration
    (8) computer security
    (9) financial management
    (10) short- and long-term planning
    (11) the ADABAS system in the Finance Office
    (12) House Information Systems
    The overall audit is projected to cost $3.7 million, or 
$3.2 million with a 15% contingency.
    These audits are about more than just pure funds 
accountability. They will focus on identifying ways to 
eliminate waste, inefficiencies, fraud, abuse and 
mismanagement, and highlight areas for contracting out, 
privatizing, streamlining, downsizing and elimination.
    Price Waterhouse is a nationally-respected accounting firm 
with outstanding professional qualifications.
    They have performed more Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Act 
financial and performance audits in federal agencies than any 
other firm.

                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                    Washington, DC, March 14, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: Last Wednesday, in a bipartisan manner, the 
Committee on House Oversight ordered reported H. Res. 107, the 
committee funding resolution for the 104th Congress. This 
Wednesday, the House will consider H. Res. 107, and we urge 
your support for the resolution.
    The resolution incorporates ``sunshine'' budgeting for 
committees--unlike the prior system, all committee salaries and 
expenses are now subject to an open, public process of hearings 
and votes in committee and in the House. The committee funding 
resolution also includes substantial savings, for the 104th 
Congress, committee funding will be cut more than 30% from the 
103rd Congress total--a savings of $67 million.
    In addition, the committee report states the goal of 
allocating at least one-third of committee resources to the 
minority as soon as practicable and notes the substantial 
progress made towards that goal by Chairmen in the 104th 
Congress.
    We urge your support for H. Res. 107, the committee funding 
resolution.
            Sincerely,
                                   Bill Thomas,

                        Franking Advisory Alert

    Dear Colleague: According to the Legislative Branch 
Appropriations Act of 1991, Members of the House of 
Representatives must submit a sample of all mass mailings to 
the Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards prior to 
printing and mailing.
    A mass mailing is defined as any mailing of substantially 
identical content totaling more than 500 pieces, regardless of 
form of address. This term does not apply to mailings in 
response to a direct inquiry, mailings of news releases to 
media, and communications with federal, state or local 
government officials.
    The following are the procedures for receiving an advisory 
opinion:
          A draft copy of the material is submitted to 
        Commission for preliminary review.
          Commission staff will verbally advise the Member's 
        office on the frankability of the draft copy proposed 
        mailing. Note: All revisions must be resubmitted for 
        approval.
          Member office provides three original copies of the 
        mailing to the Commission. A written advisory opinion 
        is issued upon receipt of these three original copies.
    A copy of the advisory opinion must be attached to all 
printing vouchers for reimbursement; i.e. the Finance Office 
will reject any voucher for printing cost of a mass mailing 
that does not include a written advisory opinion.
    The Franking Commission can only issue advisory opinions 
prior to printing or mailing!
    If you have any questions, please contact the Commission 
Majority Staff at x5-9337 (fax 6-0047), or Minority Staff at 
x5-2061 (fax 5-7664).
            Best regards,

Re Fee for use of the Attending Physician.
Members, the Resident Commissioner and Delegates,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight has 
established a fee for use of the Attending Physician during 
1995. Of course, Members may choose not to use the services 
provided by the Attending Physician. However, any Member using 
the Attending Physician's Office at any time in 1995 must send 
a personal check made payable to the U.S. Treasurer in the 
amount of $252.08 to the House Finance Office (263 Cannon). You 
should keep a copy of your canceled check as evidence of 
payment.
    If you or your staff have any questions about the fee for 
use of the Attending Physician please contact Dan Crowley of 
the Republican Staff at 225-8281 or Charles Howell of the 
Democratic staff at 225-2061.

needed step toward our commitment to reducing unnecessary costs 
by reorganizing our offsite storage facilities.
    If you would like to request any of the items, please 
contact Craven Rand at x45241 by May 12, 1995. Any publications 
remaining after the May 12 deadline will be unavailable for 
further distribution.

    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight will 
continue the traditional bicameral Congressional Intern 
Program. Attached is a list of summer housing opportunities

                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                       Washington, DC, May 9, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: While conducting a fiscal and operational 
audit of the House for the Office of Inspector General, Price 
Waterhouse LLP recently identified certain computer security 
and control weaknesses related to Member computer systems. The 
weaknesses identified could expose information on Member 
computer systems to unauthorized access, disclosure, 
modification or destruction.
    The Inspector General immediately notified the 
Administrative Assistants in all Member office whose computer 
systems potentially could be impacted by the weaknesses 
identified, and met with staff of the Chief Administrative 
Officer (CAO) to ensure prompt corrective action. On May 3, the 
Inspector General completed this phase of the House audit by 
issuing a report to the Chief Administrative Officer. Copies of 
the report were simultaneously transmitted to the Speaker, 
Majority Leader, Minority Leader and all Members of the 
Committee on House Oversight. Other related security areas are 
still under review by Price Waterhouse LLP and the results of 
these reviews will be reported separately, as soon as the work 
is completed.
    Recommendations in the May 3 Inspector General's report 
address the issues of:
          Security over access to systems
          log-on password control procedures, and
          security over critical data and files
    The initial corrective steps identified by Price Waterhouse 
LLP are being expeditiously implemented by CAO staff in order 
to protect Member systems. CAO staff immediately notified the 
computer system vendor and committed the necessary HIS staff to 
ensure that the vendor takes the appropriate corrective action.
            Best wishes,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Democratic Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,

                                      Washington, DC, May 10, 1995.

                  Computer and Office Equipment Reform

    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight today 
approved an overhaul of the House's procurement system for 
computer and other equipment, and will eliminate the ``approved 
list'' and its cumbersome restrictions on official purchasing 
by no later than September 1.
    The new procurement policy focuses on performance and 
reduced costs, setting minimum technical standards but 
otherwise granting members the flexibility to buy the least 
expensive equipment and maintenance contracts that meet their 
specific needs.
    Under this policy, the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) 
of the House will develop minimum technical standards for 
computer-related equipment, and maintain a list of preferred 
vendors. The CAO's office will also negotiate bulk rates for 
savings on common equipment such as printers and copiers, and 
develop an official process for tracking and resolving vendor 
complaints.
    In addition to improving flexibility, the new system will 
reduce costs for new equipment purchases and improve 
maintenance service by increasing competition among vendors. It 
will also apply the same rules--without exception--to every 
Member, committee, leadership and administrative office in the 
House.
    We will hold briefings for office and systems managers 
before the new rules take effect. In the meantime, an attached 
fact sheet outlines some of the major changes. Please call Rich 
Pournelle on the majority staff at x58281, or Perry Pockros on 
the minority staff at x52061, if you have any further 
questions.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.

The procedures for approval will be subject to review by the 
Committee on House Oversight.
            What offices are allowed to buy
    Offices may choose a systems integrator to provide service 
and support to computer systems. Subject to consultation with 
an HIS consultant, offices are free to purchase any equipment, 
from any vendor, that meets technical standards. HIS will not 
support computer equipment for offices without a systems 
integrator.
            Exceptions
    No exception process is necessary. Offices are free to buy 
any software, service, and equipment they choose.
            Hardware

    CMS software may be purchased separately.
            Off-the-shelf software
    Offices may purchase their choice of off-the-shelf software 
from any vendor.

    Offices are free to purchase additional computer training 
from private firms.
            Technical standards
    The office of the CAO has developed technical standards for 
hardware and software.
            Non-computer equipment
    The CAO will negotiate bulk rates for items purchased in 
volume such as fax machines and copiers. Offices will be free 
to purchase any equipment, maintenance, and support from any 
vendors.
            Vendor complaints
    The CAO will develop an official process for tracking and 
resolving vendor complaints.
    *Current contracts will remain in force until offices 
choose to negotiate new service rates.
    **The guidelines will be effective no later than September 
1, 1995.

             Attention Office Managers and Systems Managers

    Dear Colleague: On May 10, 1995 the Committee on House 
Oversight approved new guidelines for the procurement of office 
equipment and computers for Members' offices. These guidelines 
replace the former ``approved list,'' and will take effect 
September 1, 1995.
    At 1:30 p.m. on Friday June 9, in room 121 Cannon, the 
Committee and the House Systems Administrators Association will 
sponsor an informational session to explain the new guidelines, 
help your office plan for future purchases, and answer any 
questions.
    We hope your staff will be able to attend this important 
session.

    Dear Colleague: As you recall, in the early hours following 
the November election, a Transition Team was formed to review 
and establish a framework for reorganizing the functions of the 
House of Representatives--the first such review in forty years. 
At our meeting today, the Committee on House Oversight approved 
the final implementation of the work begun in November by the 
Transition Team. The new organization and new operations, which 
will phase in over the coming months, will streamline 
operations, reduce costs by $7 million and increase 
accountability.
    We are also expecting the results of the first-ever 
comprehensive financial and operational audit of the House in 
mid-July. We believe that that audit will support the 
Committee's actions, and provide valuable information to help 
us further cut costs and increase efficiency. The changes will 
be phased in over the coming summer months, and we will keep 
you fully informed so that you can be prepared for them. Below 
is a brief description of the actions authorized today.

                          employee retraining

    The reorganization of the House means that many employees 
will be competing for new jobs within the new structure, or may 
be displaced. We authorized the expenditure of such fund as may 
be needed to assist employees in retraining and outplacement 
services, in order to help them with the transition to new 
positions either in the House or in other organizations. We 
also extended the authorization to provide lump-sum payments of 
earned accrued leave to administrative employees.

                              folding room

    The mail folding and inserting operations of The 
Publications and Distribution Service, commonly known as the 
Folding Room, will be closed as of August 31, 1995. Materials 
may still be delivered to the Folding Room until August 11, 
1995 for processing. An assistance desk for printing and 
related services in the Office of Printing Services will be 
organized, which will assist in working with outside printers, 
either in Washington or your district, and will continue to 
provide computerized mailing label services.

                           in-house printers

    The current contracts with the two in-house printers will 
be terminated not later than December 31, 1995. Offices will 
continue to be authorized to use private printers, either in 
Washington or their district, to meet printing needs. The 
assistance desk in the Office of Printing Services will be 
available to assist with procuring and negotiating printing 
jobs.

                           postal operations

    The Committee authorized the Chief Administrative Officer 
to issue a request for proposals for the operation of the 
internal mail pick-up, sorting and delivery operations. The 
Committee also authorized the United States Postal Service to 
operate the postal windows at the five current locations in the 
House complex; USPS will operate the windows under their ``Post 
Office 2000'' concept which has proven successful in 
neighborhoods around the country.

                            RECORDING STUDIO

    The Recording Studio operations will be streamlined to 
reduce costs by $1.2 million. Future charges for these services 
will reflect the full cost to taxpayers. In order to achieve 
cost savings and improve efficiency, the Recording Studio will 
only operate when the House is in session. In addition, video 
and audio services will no longer be available for Members' use 
60 days prior to a contested primary or general election, and a 
more detailed reporting of the use of the facilities will be 
incorporated into the Clerk's Report as public record. Members' 
photo and identification services will be transferred to the 
Sergeant at Arms.

                           PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO

    The Photography Studio will also be streamlined for 
significant savings. Future charges for photography services 
will reflect the full cost of providing these services.

                OFFICE 2000/HOUSE INFORMATION RESOURCES

    The Committee approved an initiative, known as ``Office 
2000,'' to develop standardized office electronic 
communications, adopt a standardized groupware platform, and 
provide advanced database and communications management. This 
plan includes providing a work station to each Member office 
and enhancing electronic data communication between Members' 
district and Washington offices.
    In conjunction with the Speaker's vision to move the House 
into the forefront of the technology revolution, the Committee 
also approved a reorganization and renaming of ``House 
Information Systems'' to ``House Information Resources,'' or 
``HIR.'' The new organization combines the former Office of 
Telecommunications with the former HIS, combining data and 
voice communications under one shop. Additionally, more 
resources will be focused on Member services, through the 
creation of a Client Services Group, with a ratio of one 
technical support representative for every 10 Member offices. 
Under the old organization, one support representative had the 
responsibility for seventy Members.

                          FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

    The Committee authorized the Chief Administrative Officer 
to begin a pilot project which will lead to providing each 
Member, Committee and Leadership office with a true ``budget to 
actual'' monthly financial report, to enable better financial 
planning and expenditure tracking within each office.

                     VIDEOTELECONFERENCING FACILITY

    The Committee authorized the Chief Administrative Officer 
to create a permanent, convenient videoteleconferencing 
facility. This centrally-located facility will allow more 
effective communication with your constituents.

               REORGANIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS

    The Committee approved a reorganization plan for the Chief 
Administrative Officer, which will reduce House administrative 
employees by 34%. This reduction will be accomplished without 
any degradation in service, and will in fact improve our 
ability to meet Member needs by lifting encumbering layers of 
bureaucracy.
    The above issues represent the most significant changes in 
House operations in over forty years, and will mean real 
changes to your office operations. These actions are a part of 
our continuing effort to provide better service at a lower 
cost. Before the week's end, we will distribute to all offices 
a list of the reforms and transition that this Committee has 
implemented since January. The list is impressive--you will see 
that we have been busy!
    Watch for further information on dates of final 
implementation and new procedures in the days ahead. In the 
meantime, please call me or Committee staff at x-58281 with any 
questions.
            Best regards,
                                              Bill Thomas, Chairman
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                     Washington, DC, June 26, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: While conducting the financial and 
operational audit of the House for the Office of Inspector 
General (OIG), Price Waterhouse LLP recently identified certain 
Internet security and control weaknesses related to Member 
computer systems. This is in addition to the issues noted in 
the OIG's previous report concerning Member computer systems 
security weaknesses that we discussed with you in our May 9, 
1995 Dear Colleague letter.
    The Inspector General immediately notified the 
Administrative Assistants in all offices whose computer systems 
were impacted by the weaknesses identified and met with staff 
of the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) to ensure prompt 
corrective action with respect to these weaknesses. On June 22, 
1995, the OIG completed this phase of the House audit.
    The weaknesses identified could expose information on House 
computer systems, including Member, Committee and House Officer 
systems, to unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or 
destruction. Recommendations addressed the issues of:
          Security over access to House systems;
          House ``firewall'' (hardware and software designed to 
        control the flow of information between systems) 
        security implementation strategies; and
          Data security policies and procedures over House 
        systems.
    The initial corrective action steps identified by Price 
Waterhouse LLP are being expeditiously implemented by CAO staff 
in order to protect Member systems. No action is required on 
the part of your staff. Other related computer security areas 
are still under review by Price Waterhouse LLP and the results 
of these reviews will be reported, as soon as Price 
Waterhouse's work is completed.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                                     Washington, DC, July 18, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: Attached please find a copy of the first-
ever comprehensive independent outside audit of the House's 
finances and operations, which was delivered on time and on-
budget to the Committee on House Oversight today.
    This document is public, and can be accessed on the 
Internet at http://thomas.loc.gov. Limited hard copies are also 
available.
    This audit was conducted on a strictly bipartisan basis 
under the immediate supervision of House Inspector General John 
Lainhart. Please contact the Committee on House Oversight 
majority office at x5-8281, or the minority office at x5-2061, 
or Mr. Lainhart at x6-1250, if you have questions or would like 
further information.

                     Folding and Printing Seminars

    Dear Colleague: As previously announced, the last day to 
submit materials to the Folding Room for processing is August 
11, 1995. The Folding Room will close as of August 31, 1995. 
Three identical seminars will be presented by representatives 
of the Printing & Graphics Communications Association and the 
Government Printing Office to assist offices in the transition 
to utilizing outside vendors. Committee on House Oversight 
staff will also be available during the seminars. The seminars 
will be held in room 1310 Longworth on the following dates:
          Monday, July 31 at 11:00 a.m.
          Monday, August 7 at 2:00 p.m.
          Monday, August 14 at 2:00 p.m.
    The purpose of the seminars is to provide offices with a 
description of services available by local companies as well as 
to answer any questions you may have concerning the new 
procedures.
    If you have any questions, please contact committee staff 
(majority at x5-8281, minority at 5-2061).
            Sincerely,

   Attention Office Managers and Systems Managers--Office Equipment 
                               Guidelines

    Dear Colleague: Tomorrow, Friday July 28 in 2168 Rayburn 
HOB from 2 pm to 4 pm, the Committee on House Oversight will 
sponsor a review and comment session on guidelines for the 
acquisition of office equipment.
    The session will cover the new equipment guidelines adopted 
by the Committee on May 10, 1995. Staff from the office of the 
CAO will review and ask for comment on draft guidelines 
covering minimum technical standards for computer equipment, a 
list of supported software, and the technical support 
requirements for computer vendors.
    We hope staff will be able to attend and provide their 
feedback on these proposed standards. If you have any questions 
please contact the Committee on House Oversight Majority staff 
at x58281, or Minority staff at x52061.
            Sincerely yours,

  Important Information Regarding New Member Allowance Structure--New 
                         Congressional Handbook

    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight has 
approved three significant reforms to help you better manage 
your offices and serve your constituents. Outlined below are 
these changes which should provide your office and more 
flexibility, autonomy and, at long last, a clear, consistent 
set of regulations. These changes represent the culmination of 
many years of Republican experience as the Minority, working 
under a system which we knew cried out for improvement. The 
changes were also recommended by auditors in the independent 
House audit released on July 18, 1995. I am pleased the 
Democratic Minority fully cooperated in these changes.
    Throughout the August recess, Committee staff will hold 
seminars and be available to answer any questions about these 
changes. Of course, the new Handbook will be distributed at 
seminars and fully explained.
    Effective September 1, the current three Member allowances 
(Clerk Hire, Official Expenses and Official Mail) will be 
combined into one, official allowance: The Members' 
Representational Allowance (MRA). The 1995 MRA will be the sum 
of the three allowances, and will retain the current limitation 
on funds available for franked mail (your 1995 Official Mail 
Allowance amount + the current transfer authority of $25,000.) 
Other than a maximum amount that can be spent on official mail, 
offices may prioritize expenditures from the MRA for official 
expenses and salaries according to their district needs within 
the Committee's regulations. You will receive an official 
notice of your 1995 MRA amount prior to September 1.
    As of September 1, the newly revised Members' Congressional 
Handbook for the 104th Congress will take effect. The Handbook 
incorporates the above changes to the allowance structure and 
will replace the current U.S. House of Representatives 
Congressional Handbook. The new Handbook is a fundamental 
revision of the regulations that govern your official funds and 
replaces the inconsistent and archaic regulations with clearly 
written regulations that provide you with flexibility in 
managing your office. To maximize the new opportunities, 
Members and key staff should read the new Handbook and become 
fully acquainted with the decisions now available to Member 
offices.
    Effective September 27, the Finance Office will provide 
timely reimbursement to Members and staff for travel expenses 
charged to the American Express travel card; in turn, you will 
be responsible for paying American Express directly for charges 
to the card. Travel voucher procedures will change to require a 
new ``trip envelope'' which will help summarize your trip 
expenses and speed the reimbursement process. The use of the 
travel card continues to be limited to official purposes only.
    Please watch for upcoming notices announcing the time and 
dates of the August seminars. In the meantime, call the 
Committee's Office of Members Services at x58281 with any 
questions.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                    Washington, DC, August 8, 1995.

                     Important: Handbook Briefings

    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight will hold 
briefings over the next several weeks to educate your offices 
on the changes to the Members' Congressional Handbook.
    The briefings will be held on the following dates:
          Tuesday, August 15, 1995, 10:00 AM, 345 CHOB
          Tuesday, August 22, 1995, 10:00 AM, 1310 LHOB
          Tuesday, August 29, 1995, 10:00 AM, 345 CHOB
          Tuesday, September 5, 1995, 10:00 AM, 345 CHOB
    The Members' Congressional Handbook and summaries of 
important changes will be available for distribution at these 
meetings. Handbooks will not be distributed other than at these 
meetings, to ensure all offices have full information on the 
changes. Each office will receive, and must sign for, three 
copies.
    If you have any questions regarding the Handbook and/or the 
application of the regulations and related procedures, please 
contact the Office of Members Services at x58281.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                   Washington, DC, August 10, 1995.

                    Information on Mailing Services

    Dear Colleague: In the past few months the Committee on 
House Oversight has approved a number of far-reaching House 
reforms that are changing the way Members' offices manage their 
daily business. Among these changes are the closing of the 
folding room and the termination of contracts with the in-house 
printers.
    These changes mean that members' offices will begin using 
private-sector vendors to meet all printing, folding and 
mailing needs, and in the short term we all have to learn new 
ways of doing business.
    Attached please find some material that explains the 
options available under the new system and offers suggestions 
on who to call for help. We hope you find it useful. Please 
call the Committee at x5-8281 if we can answer questions or 
provide any further information.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                   Washington, DC, August 14, 1995.

          Operator Selected for House Beauty and Barber Shops

    Dear Colleague: On May 23, 1995 the Committee on House 
Oversight directed the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) to 
prepare Requests for Proposals (RFP) to contract for the 
privatization of the House Beauty and Barber Shops.
    As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on House 
Oversight, we are pleased to announce the completion of the 
selection process. The selection of the new private operator, 
Gino Morena Enterprises, was made by an impartial task force of 
the CAO. The selection followed an extensive advertising and 
distribution of the Beauty and Barber Shop RFP.
    We wanted to share a few highlights of the new contract:
          The contract period begins on October 1, 1995. The 
        selected operator will continue to do business at both 
        the Rayburn and Cannon facilities from 8:00 a.m. until 
        6:00 p.m. each Monday-Friday.
          The operator will offer employment contracts to the 
        current House employees.
          The operator will test new Saturday hours for the 
        initial 90-days of the contract.
          The operator will pay the House 12 percent of gross 
        sales, and 10 percent of all retail (hair care product) 
        sales. The RFP required a minimum payment of only 4 
        percent.
          The operator has other government contracts including 
        shops and salons at Ft. Meads, Andrews AFB, Bolling 
        AFB, Ft. Meter, Henderson Hall, Ft. Belvoir, Quantico 
        MCB, and the Pentagon.
          The contract is for an initial two year period, and 
        does not include shoe shine services, which are the 
        subject of an additional RFP.
    When we learned in the early days of the 104th Congress of 
the extent of the losses being sustained in keeping the Beauty 
and Barber Shops under the operation of the House, we knew that 
we had to act to remedy the problem. We believe that the CAO's 
independent analysis of the bids offered for beauty and barber 
services is an important step, and we hope that this new 
contract will be a success for both the House and the operator.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                Washington, DC, September 12, 1995.

        District Office Equipment and Furnishings Policy Change

    Dear Freshman Colleague: Effective immediately, the 
Committee on House Oversight has instituted a new policy 
regarding equipment and furnishings in Freshman Members' 
district offices.
    Shortly after your election last November, you were sent an 
inventory of equipment and furnishings in your predecessor's 
district office(s). The items which you selected to keep were 
assigned to your inventory for one year or the remainder of the 
commitment period, whichever was longer.
    Under the new policy, any equipment or furnishings in your 
district office inherited from your predecessor may be removed 
once the purchase obligation of the item has been met. The one 
year minimum requirement has been removed. If there are items 
which you wish to have removed from your district office 
inventory, contact your OSM counselor at 225-3994 to determine 
whether the purchase obligations have been met.
    If you have any questions on this policy, please contact 
the Committee on House Oversight majority staff at 225-8281 or 
minority staff at 225-2061.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
             Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards,
                                Washington, DC, September 21, 1995.

              Franking Guidelines for Historical Calendars

    Dear Colleague: Realizing that many Members' offices are 
beginning to prepare their U.S. Capitol Historical calendars 
and House of Representatives wall calendars for mailing later 
this year, the Commission would like to advise you of the 
following regulations and provisions of law. Pursuant to 
section 3210(a)(3)(G) of Title 39, United States Code, the wall 
calendars and the U.S. Capitol Historical calendars that are 
purchased with Federal funds are frankable. The following will 
be helpful when preparing the calendars.
    1. The calendars must be submitted to the Commission for 
approval if you are mailing 500 or more or if you are seeking 
reimbursement for printing a message, including your name, on 
the calendars. Please submit any intended message before 
printing it on the calendar. It is not necessary to submit the 
entire calendar; you may simply copy the front cover and submit 
that with the intended message.
    2. Holiday greetings are prohibited on any mass mailing, 
pursuant to section 3210(a)(5)(B)(iii) of title 39, U.S.C. One 
recommendation for a calendar message is ``Best Wishes,''
    We hope this information has been helpful. If you have any 
questions, please call the Commission majority staff at x59337 
or minority staff at x52061.
            Sincerely,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                Washington, DC, September 26, 1995.

          Important: New Handbook Regulations Regarding Flags

    Dear Colleague: Consistent with our philosophy of providing 
increased flexibility in managing your office, U.S. flags flown 
over the Capitol for official presentation are reimbursable 
from the Members' Representational Allowance.
    Effective immediately, this policy replaces the existing 
language found in the 1995 Members' Congressional Handbook 
(page 23), which states ``U.S. flags flown over the Capitol, 
when presented by the Member or Clerk-Hire employees in 
connection with an official event, are reimbursable from the 
MRA.'' All other language regarding flags remains applicable.
    This policy is intended to allow your office to continue to 
donate flags to constituents in the same manner as authorized 
prior to September 1, 1995.
    Contact the Committee on House Oversight, Office of Member 
Services at x58281 with any questions.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                Washington, DC, September 26, 1995.

     Important: New Handbook Policy Regarding Travel Reimbursement

    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight adopted 
the ``Travel Reimbursement Policy'' on August 3, 1995 in 
accordance with the Price Waterhouse audit recommendation that 
all reimbursement for official travel be made directly to 
travelers. However, the Committee is modifying this policy in 
order to address the concerns raised by offices at the recent 
Finance Office American Express Card briefings. There will also 
be an informational briefing on this policy by Committee staff 
on October 2, 1995 at 10 AM in 345 Cannon.
    The travel voucher envelope will not be mandatory. As of 
September 27, 1995, offices may choose to use either a standard 
voucher or the new travel voucher envelope when seeking 
reimbursement for travel-related expenses. The trip envelope 
will be an additional tool to aid your office operations, but 
will not mandate its use.
    There will be no change to the current process for seeking 
mileage reimbursement. We know there was confusion on this 
issue; however, this policy has not changed. See p. 51 of the 
Members' Congressional Handbook for mileage reimbursement 
rates.
    The following information outlines the Committee's new 
``Travel Reimbursement Policy,'' effective September 27, 1995. 
The attached policy replaces the existing ``American Express 
Card Policy'' found on pp. 53-54 of the current Members' 
Congressional Handbook. Please retain this policy for future 
reference.
    Please contact the Committee Majority staff at x58281 on 
Minority staff at x52061 with any questions.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                Washington, DC, September 29, 1995.

                New Fee for Flags Flown Over the Capitol

    Dear Colleague: In accordance with the instructions of the 
FY 1996 Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, the Architect 
of the Capitol will charge, effective October 1, 1995, a fee to 
recover the operating costs of the Flag Office. The Architect 
distributed a September 21, 1995 memo informing your office 
that the fee will be $3.30 per flag, and that each office would 
be responsible for paying a monthly invoice for the fees.
    However, this system would be impractical. Instead, the 
Committee has instructed the Office Supply Service to 
incorporate the $3.30 flag fee at the point of sale. When you 
are purchasing a flag to be flown over the Capitol, whether it 
is for your office or for a constituent, you must inform OSS, 
who will debit the charge from your MRA and provide you with a 
receipt to verify that the fee has been paid. OSS will then, on 
a monthly basis, remit all fees collected to the U.S. Treasury 
to offset the costs of the Flag Office. The Senate is 
instituting a similar procedure. Your office will not be sent a 
monthly invoice from the Architect for this fee, as was stated 
in the September 21, 1995 memo.
    This $3.30 fee is reimbursable from your Members' 
Representational Allowance for flags provided to constituents, 
consistent with the Members' Congressional Handbook regulations 
(copy of recent Dear Colleague on Handbook regulations on the 
reverse). Constituents may also reimburse this $3.30 fee, just 
as the cost of wrapping and shipping may be reimbursed.
    Please contact the Office Supply Service at x53994 for 
procedural information.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                   Washington, DC, October 3, 1995.

                      Congressional Accountability

Members, the Resident Commissioner,
  Delegates, and House Officers,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: Most of the provisions of the Congressional 
Accountability Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-1) will take effect 
on January 23, 1996. The Committee on House Oversight is 
responsible for oversight of the Office of Compliance, which 
will carry out a program of education for all House employing 
authorities on the laws to be made applicable to them. The 
Office of Compliance is also responsible for drafting 
substantive regulations to implement the application of these 
laws. These regulations will be referred to the Committee for 
approval prior to consideration by the full House.
    As part of the regulation drafting process, the Office of 
Compliance will issue notices of proposed rulemaking, which 
will be printed in the Congressional Record. These notices 
provide an opportunity to comment on specific regulations, or 
to offer general guidance to the Office during the drafting 
process. The first of such notices were printed in the 
Congressional Record on September 28, 1995 (S14542) and 
September 29, 1995 (H9736).
    Among the regulations to be drafted are those relating to 
the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Fair Labor Standards 
Act. These regulations will directly affect every House 
employing office on such issues as overtime and eligibility for 
parental leave. Therefore, we urge you to provide comment on 
the application of these laws to the House by writing to the 
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance, Room 
LA-200, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. 
Please contact Dan Crowley, Committee Counsel, at x5828, or 
Charles Howell, Minority Counsel, at x52061, if you have any 
questions.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, October 10, 1995.

                        Approved List Extension

    Dear Colleague: On September 27, 1995, the Committee on 
House Oversight notified the Chief Administrative Officer that 
the approved list would be extended through November 30, 1995. 
This step was taken to allow the Committee to complete a 
bipartisan review of the remaining issues regarding the 
implementation of the equipment procurement guidelines.
    Accordingly, your office may continue to purchase equipment 
and maintenance either from the Approved List or according to 
the procedures outlined in the User's Guide to Purchasing 
Equipment, Software and Related Services. Offices are 
encouraged to purchase equipment which meets the draft minimum 
technical standards, a list of which may be obtained by 
contacting Office Systems Management at 225-3994.
    If you have any questions regarding the extension of the 
Approved List, please contact Committee staff at 225-8281 
(majority) or 225-2061 (minority).
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, October 12, 1995.

                 Information Regarding the New Flag Fee

    Dear Colleague: As you know, the Committee on House 
Oversight has instructed the Office Supply Service to 
incorporate the $3.30 fee for flags designated to be flown over 
the Capitol at the point of sale. A transition period has been 
designated to provide Member offices with sufficient time to 
inform constituents of the new prices and to process previously 
received flag requests.
    Prior to November 15, 1995, Member offices have the option 
to either absorb the $3.30 fee or pass it on to the 
constituent.
    After November 15, 1995, Member offices will be required to 
charge constituents for the $3.30 fee. The Members' 
Representational Allowance may only be used to pay for the 
$3.30 fee when the flag is purchased as a gift for the 
constituent's personal use or display, in accordance with page 
32 in the Members' Congressional Handbook.
    Please contact the Office Supply Service at x53321 for 
procedural information.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, October 17, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: As unanimously agreed to by the Committee 
on House Oversight, an important transition in services to 
Members of the House is taking place this month. The Postal 
Service is taking over the operation of the five House retail 
post offices and, in the process, is modernizing their entire 
physical design and retailing concept. In particular, the main 
House post office in B202 Longworth will become a ``state-of-
the-art'' facility, containing a postal store with open 
merchandising, as well as other advanced retailing features. 
The other post offices, located at 2106 Rayburn, 202 Cannon, H-
101 the Capitol and H2-119 Ford, are also being renovated under 
new retailing standards. Every one of our post offices will be 
staffed, equipped and designed to make purchases of stamps and 
mailing of letters and packages quicker and more convenient for 
you and your staff.
    This Thursday, October 19, at 9:30 a.m., Congressman John 
McHugh, Chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight 
Subcommittee on the Postal Service and the Postmaster General 
Marvin Runyon will join in cutting the ribbon on the flagship 
of the new House post offices, at B202 Longworth. We invite you 
and your staff to attend this grand opening, or to drop by any 
time to experience a brand-new retailing concept that is being 
implemented in post offices throughout the country.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, October 27, 1995.

    New Prices and Policies: House Photography and Recording Studios

    Dear Colleague: In June, the Committee on House Oversight 
directed the Chief Administrative Officer to reduce costs in 
the Photography Studio by $325,000 and in the Recording Studio 
by $1.2 million, and to present plans to the Committee which 
would make these operations self-supporting. The Committee 
chose to downsize, rather than outsource these operations, 
because of the need for convenient and flexible service to 
assist you in your official and representational duties.
    Accordingly, the Committee yesterday approved new prices 
and policies for the House Photography and Recording Studio. A 
copy of this information is attached. Please note the following 
highlights:
          Costs for prints and processing of film are 
        comparable to market prices.
          The Recording Studio will be closed on Mondays and 
        when the House is not in session, but will work to 
        accommodate requests or to locate alternate facilities 
        during those times.
          A 60-day pre-election (both primary and general) ban 
        is in effect for the use of the Recording Studio. 
        Accordingly, both Members and Recording Studio 
        personnel should be aware of and must follow this 60 
        day cut-off.
          Both facilities are for the use of sitting Members of 
        Congress only, and are exclusively for the discharge of 
        official and representational duties.
    Please contact the Committee (Majority, x58281; Minority, 
x52061) with any questions or comments.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                                  Washington, DC, November 6, 1995.

                      Mileage Reimbursement Rates

    Dear Colleague: Please be advised that the Government 
Service Administration (GSA) has changed the maximum allowable 
reimbursement rates for airplane and motorcycle mileage. 
Accordingly, effective immediately, Members and Clerk Hire 
staff, traveling in support of the conduct of official 
business, may be reimbursed up to a maximum of 88.5 cents per 
mile when traveling via a privately owned airplane and a 
maximum of 24.5 cents per mile when traveling via motorcycle.
    As always, Members may set their own mileage reimbursement 
rate at any amount not in excess of the authorized maximum. If 
you have any questions, please contact the Committee on House 
Oversight (Majority staff at 225-8281 or Minority staff at 225-
2061).
            Best regards,

           Attention: Important Information on Redistricting

    Dear Colleague: In the past few weeks the Committee on 
House Oversight and the Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct have received several queries regarding redistricting 
activities. Therefore, we are writing to remind you of the 
rules in this important area.
    Since redistricting is deemed to be an inherently political 
activity, neither the Members' Representational Allowance, nor 
any other official resource, including staff time, may be used 
for redistricting purposes. As with any political activity, 
House employees may work on redistricting matters on their own 
time, as long as they do not do so in the congressional office 
or otherwise use any congressional resources.
    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to 
contact the Committee on House Oversight at x58281 or the 
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct at x57103.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman, House Oversight.

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, November 13, 1995.

                         Lapse in House Funding

Members, the Resident Commissioner, Delegates,
  Committee Chairmen, and House Officers,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: In the event that there is a lapse in 
appropriations relating to the Legislative Branch of the 
Federal Government, it will be necessary to shut down non-
essential House operations effective on November 14, 1995. 
However, the Committee on House Oversight has determined that 
any disruption in legislative activities of the House would 
result in an inability to exercise the powers specified in 
Article I of the Constitution of the United States.
    Therefore, in accordance with the authority vested in the 
Committee on House Oversight under House Rule X, clause 1(h), 
the Committee directs that upon a lapse in appropriations for 
the Legislative Branch, each House employing authority shall 
designate as essential personnel only those employees whose 
primary job responsibilities are directly related to 
legislative activities. All other House personnel shall be 
placed in a furlough status by the appropriate employing 
authority until appropriations are made available. Each 
employing authority who furloughs employees shall submit to the 
Finance Office an ``Authorization for Furlough of Employees'' 
form by November 15, 1995. These forms are available in the 
Finance Office (sample on back).
    Please contact Committee staff at x58281 (Majority) or 
x52061 (Minority) if we can be of any further assistance.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                                                 November 15, 1995.
                 Update on Continuation of House Audit
    Dear Colleague and Staff: On the same day the House Audit 
(``Audit'') was released, July 18, 1995, the House unanimously 
approved H. Res. 192 directing the House Inspector General John 
Lainhart (``IG'') to continue efforts to finalize the results 
of the audit. The unanimous passage of H. Res. 192 reflected 
the view of Republican and Democratic Leaderships that a 
deliberate process was necessary in order to clarify unresolved 
issues. The Inspector General acts under the oversight of this 
Committee, and we have ensured his complete independence in his 
effort to clarify unresolved issues raised by the Audit.
    The initial Audit findings were reached based on standard 
audit procedures, which do not generally include exhaustive 
reviews of individual transactions. The continued effort as 
required by H. Res. 192 has included a detailed review of 
transactions. At this time, the IG informs us that the 
transactions under examination are for the most part the result 
of inadequate internal controls and procedures in House 
administrative offices during the Audit period (10/1/93 through 
12/31/94). The Report of Independent Accountants issued by 
Price Waterhouse on the House Financial Statements included the 
following:
          ``. . . in the absence of an effective internal 
        control structure, there can be no assurance that all 
        House transactions were properly recorded, accumulated 
        and reported in accordance with the rules, policies, 
        and procedures established by the House . . . the 
        shortcomings in the House's information systems and the 
        weaknesses in its internal control structure were so 
        severe that they affected the availability and 
        reliability of data and information supporting the 
        financial statements . . .''
    In order to finalize the requirements of H. Res. 192, the 
IG will be contacting Member offices and staff, by letter, to 
request that you check your office records and confirm whether 
those records are at odds with House records. If a comparison 
of records results in a disputed amount, the Inspector General 
will work with you to resolve the discrepancy. If an error in 
payment is identified, then reimbursement to the U.S. Treasury 
should settle the transaction.
    The Inspector General is required by H. Res. 192 to report 
his findings by November 30, 1995. Your prompt attention to any 
communication from his office will be appreciated so that he 
can meet this deadline. All detailed information, including the 
names of Members and staff who will be contacted remains solely 
in the possession of the Inspector General. Please contact 
either of us or Majority (x58281) or Minority (x52061) staff, 
if you have any questions.
            Sincerely,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, November 15, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: Attached is a further definition of the 
meaning of ``essential'' and ``non-essential'' employees for 
the House of Representatives, including an opinion from the 
Congressional Research Service about the fundamental role of 
the House under Article I of the U.S. Constitution.
    I hope this information helps you in your decision process 
at this time, and further clarifies the Dear Colleague dated 
November 13, 1995 regarding possible furloughs of House 
employees.
    If you have any questions, please contact Dan Crowley or 
Stacy Carlson at the Committee's majority office, x5-8281.
    Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
    Attachment.
                                ------                                

                    Congressional Research Service,
                                   The Library of Congress,
                                 Washington, DC, November 15, 1995.
To: Honorable William Thomas, Chairman, Committee on House 
        Oversight.
From: American Law Division.
Subject: Impact of Lapse in Funding on House Operations.
    This memorandum is submitted in response to the committee's 
request, as discussed with Dan Crowley of the Committee staff, 
for a brief analysis of the Committee's memorandum (``Lapse in 
House Funding'') of November 13, 1995, directed to Members and 
House Officers.
    During gaps in funding, the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1341 et seq.) prohibits the employment of federal 
personnel (except in emergencies), unless otherwise authorized 
by law. However, this prohibition has been construed by both 
the Attorney General and the Comptroller General to allow the 
President and the Congress to continue to perform their 
constitutional functions notwithstanding lapses in funding. 
With respect to Members of Congress, it should be noted that 
their salaries are permanently appropriated. This permanent 
appropriation also provides funds for ``administrative 
expenses'' related thereto.
    With regard to the House, the scope of its constitutional 
responsibilities is outlined in article I. Although other 
powers are vested in the House by the Constitution, its 
foremost function, pursuant to art. I, sec. 1, is to legislate. 
It would appear that, during a funding lapse, the House could 
continue to perform all tasks incident to the legislative 
process, including, inter alia, the gathering of information 
from appropriate sources, including district office staff, 
needed to make legislative judgments.
    The Committee's November 13, 1995, memorandum, 
appropriately directs each Member and House officer to 
determine those persons on his or her staff who are essential 
personnel ``whose primary job responsibilities are directly 
related to legislative activities.'' Members of the House and 
House officers are employing authorities (see 2 U.S.C. 
Sec. Sec. 92, 291 et seq.; House Rule LI, cl. 16) and can 
therefore determine those persons on their staffs who are 
required for the continued performance of the legislative 
functions of the House, and all tasks incident thereto, during 
a funding lapse.
                                         Jay R. Shampansky,
                       Legislative Attorney, American Law Division.

             Questions and Answers: Lapse in House Funding

    1. Who decides who will remain at work, and what is the 
definition of ``essential'' versus ``non-essential'' employee?
    Each Member and Committee Office is an ``employing 
authority'' under House Rules. Employing Authorities make the 
determination of who within their employ is an essential 
employee. The determination, and retention, of essential 
employees is necessary to avoid any disruption in the ability 
of the House to exercise the powers specified in Article I of 
the Constitution. Accordingly, the Committee on House Oversight 
has determined that those employees whose primary job 
responsibilities are directly related to legislative activities 
are considered ``essential.''
    2. What is a definition of ``legislative activities?''
    Legislative activities include all functions and operations 
of Member offices that are ``an integral part of the 
deliberative and communicative processes by which Members 
participate in committee and House proceedings with respect to 
the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed 
legislation or with respect to other matters which the 
Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House,'' 
U.S. Supreme Court (421 U.S. at 504). Legislative activities 
also include those that are necessary to ensure that the public 
and constituents are adequately served and informed of 
legislation already passed and legislation pending before the 
House. See also the CRS Opinion dated November 15, 1995.
    For Committees, legislative activities are those determined 
by the Chairman as necessary to fulfill the jurisdiction of a 
Committee under House rules.
    For administrative offices of the House, ``Responsibilities 
directly related to legislative activities'' as those necessary 
to ensure that the institution can function and carry on 
legislative business. Functions such as ensuring that votes can 
be cast and tallied, on-going budgets are kept, security and 
health of visitors and personnel are ensured and resources are 
available to communicate with constituents and other Members.
    3. Why must any employees be kept at all?
    It has been determined that any disruption in the 
activities of the House would result in an inability to 
exercise the powers specified in Article I of the Constitution.
    4. Will the official expenses necessary to operate our 
office be paid?
    During the time period that the House' appropriations has 
lapsed, no new bills will be paid, and current vendors will be 
told that payments (such as rent and power bills) will be 
forthcoming shortly. Members may continue to incur obligations 
in the performance of their official and representational 
duties (such as travel and mailing costs), which the House will 
honor, and pay, upon passage of a new funding resolution. 
Expenses incurred prior to midnight, November 13 will be paid 
in the usual fashion.
    5. What House and Legislative Branch offices will 
definitely be closed?
    Offices which are not determined to be related to 
legislative activities. These include the House Gift Shop, the 
Capitol Guide Service, the Botanic Garden and the Flag Office. 
The functions within other offices, such as furniture 
refinishing and office systems management, that are not 
directly related to legislative activities, will also be 
closed.
    6. How many employees will be furloughed?
    There are approximately 10,000 staff of the House of 
representatives about 80 percent work for Members' Washington 
and District offices and for Committees. Each Member and 
Committee Chair determines who is essential. For the remaining 
approximately 2,000 people employed in House administrative 
offices, several offices will be closed completely, some will 
be operating at reduced levels while other offices will rotate 
among furloughed and non-furloughed employees.
    Despite these reductions, House legislative operations will 
continue as normally as possible in accordance with our 
Constitutional responsibilities.
    7. What about other services, like the cafeterias and the 
Day Care Center?
    The House restaurants and cafeterias are operated by 
private contractors, are unaffected by the Federal budget and 
will be open for business, as will all other services provided 
by outside entities. The Day Care Center and the Page Program 
are funded primarily through tuition payments, and will operate 
as usual.
    8. How and when will employees be paid?
    Never before has the Legislative Branch been put in this 
exact situation. The Speaker of the House and the Majority 
Leader stated late last week that Legislative Branch employees 
will be treated as other federal employees have been 
historically treated.
    Offices should complete the paperwork, such as furlough 
forms or payroll authorization forms according to the normal 
deadlines set by the Finance Office. As soon as a funding 
agreement is reached, we will work to ensure payment of amounts 
due, including salaries, as quickly as possible.
    9. Is a furloughed employee still an employee of the House?
    Page 12 of the Members Congressional Handbook outlines the 
criteria and conditions of an employee under furlough status. 
In summary, furloughed employees continue to occupy a payroll 
slot and accrue sick leave and retirement benefits, but are not 
in active pay status and must pay the government's portion of 
health benefits.
    10. If I furlough an employee, can he/she still come into 
work?
    If you have decided that an employee is non-essential, he/
she should not come in and perform official duties or volunteer 
services.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, November 17, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: We are writing to announce several changes 
in services provided by the Congressional Research Service.
    First, we are pleased to announce that a CRS Home Page is 
now available to any Member or committee office connected to 
the secured Capitol Hill Internet network (CAPNET). The Home 
Page allows you to obtain CRS information and products 24 hours 
a day, and to be linked to a vast number of useful public 
policy Internet resources.
    CRS will be hosting a full day of continuous demonstrations 
of their new Home Page.
          Date: December 6, 1995.
          Time: 10:00 am to 3:00 pm.
          Place: National Digital Library, James Madison 
        Building, First Floor Atrium.
    CRS will be sending you and your staff formal invitations 
to the December 6th activities. Meanwhile if you would like to 
learn more about the CRS Home Page, please call Robert Newlen 
at 7-4313.
    Developing technological tools such as the Home Page is one 
way that CRS has managed the demand for its services in a way 
that preserves its breadth of coverage and its range and 
quality of services, even as budget constraints have 
necessitated reductions in three other CRS services:
          The CRS Reference Center in the Ford House Office 
        Building will close as of November 27, 1995. CRS will 
        preserve the level of its reference services available 
        in its other sites--(Longworth and Rayburn House Office 
        Buildings, the Senate Russell Building as well as the 
        facilities in the Jefferson and Madison Buildings).
          Hours of service in the Reading Rooms and Reference 
        Centers will be slightly modified as of November 27, 
        1995. Specifically, Reference Centers will close \1/2\ 
        hour early at 5:30 pm; the Madison La Follette Reading 
        Room will close at 8:00 pm instead of 9:30 pm Monday 
        through Thursday, at 6 pm rather than 9:30 pm on 
        Fridays, and on Sundays.
          As of the beginning of the Second Session, briefings 
        conducted by CRS personnel for non-Members and non-
        congressional staff will be eliminated, unless in 
        undertaking these briefings the professional capacity 
        of CRS staff in serving the Congress is enhanced. Since 
        some of you have used these briefings to educate your 
        constituents on how the Congress works, we encourage 
        you to take advantage of a CRS-developed video 
        presentation on this topic. CRS also will continue to 
        offer your staff training on the Congress and its 
        operations. For more information on these programs, 
        please call Robert Newlen at 7-4313.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, November 20, 1995.

              Important Payroll Status for House Employees

    Dear Colleague: Last night, November 19, President Clinton 
signed the FY 1996 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill into 
law. Based upon this action, Legislative Branch funding has 
been enacted. Therefore, the need to furlough employees not 
deemed essential to legislative activities has ended. The 
following information should be useful at this time:
          Today, Office of Finance payroll counselors will be 
        calling offices who submitted furlough forms to verify 
        dates and the completion of those forms.
          Based on legislative language which will be included 
        in the Continuing Resolution to be considered by the 
        House tonight, which will require compensation of all 
        federal employees furloughed as a result of a lapse in 
        appropriations, the Committee has directed the Finance 
        office to restore active pay status for all employees 
        as of today, November 20.
          Therefore, absent written instructions otherwise 
        (i.e. payroll authorization form reducing pay for 
        furlough period or termination/reinstatement due to 
        furlough), furloughed employees will receive standard 
        compensation for the month of November.
          However, if Members wish to have the public record 
        indicate that furloughs were issued, manual adjustments 
        will be needed and pay for the furlough dates may not 
        be made until approximately December 8th. Please verify 
        this with your payroll counselor.
          If an employee was not appointed to furlough status, 
        no action is needed. Pay for November will be received 
        as usual on the last day of the month.
          Official expenses incurred during the period of 
        lapsed appropriations will be honored and paid, in 
        accordance with Federal law, House Rules and 
        regulations of the Committee.
    Please call the Committee, majority at x58281 or minority 
at x52061 if you have any questions.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                                 Washington, DC, November 20, 1995.

                    Expiration of the Approved List

    Dear Colleague: This letter is to remind you that effective 
November 30, 1995, the use of the Approved List as a source for 
purchasing office and computer equipment ends. Accordingly, if 
your office wishes to purchase equipment from the Approved 
List, requisition forms must be submitted to Office Systems 
Management by close of business on November 30, 1995.
    After November 30, 1995, all purchases will be made 
according to the procedures outlined in the Users' Guide to 
Purchasing Equipment, Software and Related Services.
    If you have any questions, please contact Committee staff 
at 225-8281 (majority) or 225-2061 (minority).

              Important: Mass Mailing Pre-Election Cutoff

    Dear Colleague: The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act 
of 1996 includes language which prohibits Members of Congress 
from using official funds to send unsolicited mass mailings 
postmarked within 90 days before an election in which the 
Member is a candidate.
    This is a change from current law which prohibits mass 
mailings 60 days prior to an election. Attached is a list of 
cut-off dates for congressional primaries in each state (both 
alphabetically and chronologically); we will also place a 
detailed explanation of these provisions in the Congressional 
Record.
    Members whose name appears on any election ballot whether 
primary, general, special, or runoff, are prohibited from 
sending mass mailings (500 pieces or more of substantially 
identical content) during the 90 day period preceding both the 
primary (special or runoff) and the general election. Members 
seeking advisory opinions, which are required for mass 
mailings, must certify that, to the best of their knowledge, 
the frankability of the proposed mailing is not adversely 
affected by applicable State election laws. A sample election 
verification form appears on the reverse.
    Violation of the pre-election mass mailing prohibition is a 
serious offense, and Members are urged to call the Franking 
Commission x59337 (majority), x52061 (minority) with any 
questions. Members and staff must be fully aware of all 
requirements and guidelines on the use of the frank. Do not 
rely on vendors to monitor or comply with deadlines.
            Sincerely,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, November 29, 1995.
Members, Resident Commissioner, and Delegates,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: Currently, House Information Resources 
provides several services to interconnect Member's Washington 
and district offices. These services are charged to Members' 
Allowances per month, per connection, based on the speed of the 
service selected.
    Beginning January 1, 1996 each Member will be provided, 
upon request, one standard Washington to district office data 
network connection at no charge to your Members 
Representational Allowance (MRA). By requiring HIR to contract 
for this service we hope to improve your office productivity at 
a significantly lower cost. In order to qualify for this 
program, the equipment in your office must meet specified 
technical requirements.
    If you already have one or more standard network 
connection(s) HIR will automatically discontinue billing your 
MRA for one network connection as of January 1, 1996. The 
annual charge to the MRA will decrease by an average of $6,000 
for those Members currently using a data network connection. 
Note: A standard connection is a Private Line or Frame Relay 
service up to 56 kbps in speed.
    In order to best meet the needs of all Members, we have 
asked HIR to prioritize incoming requests to make sure that 
those of you without a permanent district network connection 
are served first. After that, other Members who wish to either 
connect an additional District Office or order a speed upgrade 
for an existing connection will be served.
    Due to the complexity of these services, the minimum time 
to complete an order will be seven weeks. Depending on demand, 
it is possible that some orders could take up to four months to 
fill.
    You should be aware that office applications perform 
differently with the various data network services that are 
offered, and your office should work closely with your 
applications provider or systems integrator to assure 
acceptable performance.
    For more information about technical requirements and 
ordering procedures, office system administrators should 
contact their HIR Technical Support Representative at x56002.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, November 30, 1995.

               Program Report on Followup to House Audit

    Dear Colleague, Committee Chair, Delegates and Resident 
Commissioner: The Inspector General, John Lainhart, today 
presented detailed testimony to the Committee on House 
Oversight concerning the process and methodology of the 
continuing audit efforts as required by H. Res. 192 (A summary 
of his testimony is attached). H. Res. 192 was passed 
unanimously by the House on July 18, 1995 and directed the 
Inspector General to follow up on findings released in the 
first-ever comprehensive House Audit presented that same day.
    In a letter dated November 29, 1995, Mr. Lainhart requested 
a maximum 30-day extension to report the final results of his 
follow-up audit to the House, stating ``we cannot reach a final 
conclusion until all responses to our confirmation letters are 
received and analyzed. These letters sent out in the last few 
weeks requested responses by no later than November 29, 
however, to date, a significant number of the responses have 
not been received and a number of issues still have not been 
resolved.''
    The Inspector General indicated that most of the 
outstanding issues are due to the findings outlined in the 
House Audit of poor record-keeping and document management by 
the House during the Audit period of October 1, 1993 through 
December 31, 1994. While the Inspector General has completed 
his review of House records, outside vendors, former staff and 
Members as well as current Members and staff may have records 
at odds with the House's--a likely possibility given what the 
independent auditors concluded in their July, 1995 report:
    ``. . . there can be no assurance that all House 
transactions were properly recorded, accumulated and reported 
in accordance with the Rules, policies and procedures 
established by the House . . . the shortcomings in the House's 
information systems and the weaknesses in its internal control 
structure were so severe that they affected the availability 
and reliability of data and information supporting the 
financial statements . . .''
    Therefore, in the interest of presenting a complete and 
conclusive audit to both the House and the public, the 
Committee agreed with the Inspector General's request of a 
maximum 30 day extension. Please contact majority (x58281) or 
minority (x52061) committee staff for any additional 
information.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Member.
                                ------

         New Source for Government and Legislative Information

Members, Resident Commissioner, Delegates,
Committee Chairmen, and Ranking Minority Members,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: As part of the Information Systems Plan for 
the House, we are working to provide a wide variety of 
resources for you and your staff which will be available 
electronically over the Capitol Network (CAPNET) and the 
Internet. Starting December 1, 1995 your office will be able to 
use Government Printing Office (GPO) resources through its GPO-
Access program at no cost to your office.
    The Government Printing Office (GPO) already provides 
access in both electronic and published formats to a wide 
variety of information to U.S. Government Depository Libraries. 
Since GPO already is mandated by Congress to provide this 
information to these libraries, the incremental cost to provide 
access to this same information is zero.
    The data sources include The Federal Register, The 
Congressional Record, Public Laws, every published version of 
Bills, and most GAO Reports. This information is available in 
several formats, including plain text for older computers and 
an exciting format, ``Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format 
(PDF)'' which allows your offices to print exact copies of 
Bills, Laws, or the Congressional Record for your constituents. 
This can even be done directly from your district offices.
    The House Systems Administrators Association (HSAA) is 
pleased to host an introductory presentation on Monday, 
December 4, 1995 at 1:30 pm. The meeting will take place in 
Annex 1, room 116.
    For more information about technical requirements, 
training, and ordering procedures, office system administrators 
should contact their HIR Technical Support Representative at 
x56002. For more information about GPO-Access please contact 
the GPO Help Desk at 512-1530.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,

                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, December 8, 1995.

                     Change in Subscription Policy

    Dear Members, Delegates, Resident Commissioner and 
Committee Chairs: The Committee on House Oversight has directed 
the Finance Office to process vouchers for subscriptions 
received from Member and Committee offices through close of 
business January 2, 1996, using 1995 funds, including those for 
services in 1996. Additionally, Members are now authorized to 
purchase subscriptions that exceed the end of their term, so 
long as the subscription is for no more than 12 months.
    Accordingly, your office may send vouchers for 
subscriptions to the Finance Office for processing. All 
subscriptions received on or after January 3, 1996, will be 
charged to the allowance available on the beginning date of the 
subscription.
    If you have any questions regarding the subscription 
policy, please contact Committee staff at 225-8281 (majority) 
or 225-2061 (minority).
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, December 13, 1995.
    Dear Colleague: At our meeting today, the Committee on 
House Oversight approved the following actions which will 
affect your office operations:
    1996 Members Representational Allowance: The allowance 
amount will be increased by $11,400 in 1996, reflecting the 2% 
federal pay comparability action already approved by the 
President for federal employees. The formula for calculating 
the Allowance (official mail formula, expenses formula) is not 
changed; however, this year, as every year, your allowance 
amount may change due to an increase or decrease in the number 
of postal delivery sites in your district. The exact amount of 
the 1996 Allowance for your district will be sent to you 
shortly.
    Disclosure of 1996 Allowances: In accordance with our 
commitment to an open house, the Committee voted that the 
amount of the 1996 Members Representational Allowances (the 
authorized amount) will be published in the quarterly report of 
the House, and available to the public upon request. 
Expenditures will continue to be published in the quarterly 
report; this action will make your authorized amount available 
as well.
    Contracting out of House Postal Operations: The Committee 
approved a contract between the House and Pitney Bowes 
Management Services for the operation of the House postal 
services beginning February 13, 1996. The contract is expected 
to save over $2 million in taxpayer funds in its first year, 
and up to $9.8 million over the life of the contract. Current 
House postal operations employees will be interviewed by Pitney 
Bowes, which expects to retain a majority of the current 
employees and will offer a more generous benefits package than 
the employees receive from the federal government. Employees 
will remain on the House payroll for sixty days and will 
receive full outplacement and training services from the Chief 
Administrative Officer.
    Implementation of Congressional Accountability Act: We 
approved two resolutions which, when agreed to by the House, 
will adopt the final regulations implementing the Congressional 
Accountability Act, provisionally, to take effect when the Act 
takes effect on January 23, 1996. The Office of Compliance is 
expected to issue its final regulations the week of January 8, 
when the House will be in recess, and this action was necessary 
in order to ensure that offices have clear direction for 
implementation of the many aspects of the Act on January 23. 
The resolutions passed by the Committee today must be approved 
by the full House prior to adjournment.
    Please call either majority (x58281) or minority (x52061) 
staff with any questions or for further information.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                                           Ranking Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,

                                 Washington, DC, December 19, 1995.

                  Attention: Holiday Expenses Reminder

    Dear Colleague: As stated in this week's Committee on House 
Oversight End-of-Year Budgeting seminars, the Members' 
Representational Allowance (MRA) may not be used to pay for 
holiday expenses. Holiday expenses include, but are not limited 
to, the printing and production of holiday announcements, 
decorations, and any costs associated with holiday parties or 
other social events.
    The Franking Commission also has several restrictions 
regarding the use of colors, illustrations, and holiday 
announcements in any correspondence. Please contact the 
Franking Commission at x59337 prior to sending any 
correspondence.
    If you have any questions regarding an expenditure from the 
MRA, please contact the Committee on House Oversight Majority 
staff at x58281 or Minority staff at x52061 prior to incurring 
the expense.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                 Washington, DC, December 19, 1995.

         Information Concerning Computer and Software Purchases

    Dear Colleague, Resident Commissioner, Delegate, and 
Committee Chairman: The Committee on House Oversight is working 
with House Information Resources (HIR) and other organizations 
on Capitol Hill to implement a more modern information 
processing infrastructure.
    As part of that effort, each Member and Committee office 
will receive one pentium-class IBM-Compatible desktop computer 
during 1996. The cost will not come from the Member's 
Representational Allowance or Committee budgets. Each computer 
will come with an initial three year hardware warranty, but 
offices will be responsible for any software support charges 
from your Systems Integrator.
    We are providing this equipment directly to offices for two 
reasons:
    First, the CyberCongress initiative includes the 
implementation of paperless administrative functions to 
increase staff efficiency, increase the speed of administrative 
transactions, and reduce overall central administrative costs. 
These functions will include payroll administration, travel 
vouchers, and ordering office supplies. By having a common 
hardware platform in each office, HIR can provide the easiest-
to-use software at the lowest cost for the House.
    The paperless administration systems will be rolled out to 
users in several phases during 1996. The first phase will be 
provided for user acceptance testing during the second quarter 
of 1996.
    Second, many new information resources for legislative 
research and other functions are being made available through 
the Internet. It is important that each office have the 
capability to access these valuable resources through World 
Wide Web Browsers.
    As you consider your end of the year purchases, we want you 
to know that a limited number of systems may be requested for 
early delivery on a first-come, first-serve basis during 
December and January. The contract requires the supplier to 
update the performance of the systems supplied over the life of 
the contract. So, if your office does not have an immediate 
need for a new computer, we advise you to request at a later 
date to take advantage of the most recent technology. You 
should request a system at this time only if you have immediate 
requirements.
    As a second part of this effort, the House has completed a 
volume purchase arrangement for Windows-95 for 286-class and 
above computers. While some details still need to be worked 
out, this operating system software will be available for 
offices at no charge starting in January of 1996. Accordingly, 
we advise you to postpone any purchase of Windows-95 to take 
advantage of the House purchase in January. Of course, if you 
request your Systems Integrator to install this software on 
your desktops you will incur a software installation charge 
from the Systems Integrator.
    For more information about technical requirements, 
training, and ordering procedures, office system administrators 
should contact your HIR Technical Support Representative at 
x56002.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                          House of Representatives,
             Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards,
                                 Washington, DC, December 20, 1995.

 Important Franking Information: Increased Public Disclosure Begins in 
                                January

    Dear Colleague: The Franking Commission has adopted a new 
policy allowing for full disclosure and photocopying of all 
materials submitted to the Commission, including the disclosure 
of written staff advisory opinions. Beginning January 3, 1996, 
all mass mailings, regardless of mail type, will be available 
for public review and photocopying. Materials that incurred 
printing costs but are not mass mailings (such as posters, 
Congressional Record reprints, etc.) also will be disclosed.
    This action supersedes current Commission policy that 
allows only postal patron and individually addressed third-
class materials to be available for public inspection, but not 
photocopied.
    Beginning January 3, 1996, the Legislative Resource Center 
will make these materials available to the public. Materials 
and mailings issued prior to January 3, 1996, continue to be 
handled under the old policy. The Legislative Resource Center 
is located at 1036 Longworth House Office Building, phone 225-
1300.
    The Commission is available to answer any questions you may 
have or to advise you further. Please contact majority (x59337) 
or minority (x52061) staff for assistance.
            Sincerely,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                                   Washington, DC, January 2, 1996.

                        A True Record of Reform

    Dear Colleague: All of us can be proud of the progress we 
have made during the last 12 months in getting this House in 
order. We have kept the promises that we made to the citizens 
over a year ago.
    Overall, the reforms initiated by the Committee on House 
Oversight have resulted in a $50 million savings during 1995 
and led to a reduction of over $50 million in the 1996 
operating budget of the House. We oversaw the first independent 
and comprehensive House audit and immediately began 
implementing the report's recommendations for stabilizing the 
House's financial management.
    Attached is a month-by-month progress report on 
Congressional reforms of the House. In short, we have reduced 
many unnecessary expenditures (Legislative Service 
Organizations, for example) and cut payrolls swollen with 
waste. The Committee has acted in a non-partisan and fair 
manner, implementing more efficient operations and greater 
public disclosure.
    Please review the attached record of accomplishment and let 
us know if we can provide any additional information or answer 
any questions. We plan to continue our efforts in 1996, and 
welcome your comments and suggestions.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.

    Accomplished the Goals of the Opening Day Checklist of the 
Contract with America:
          Reduced committee staff by one-third (622 positions 
        eliminated);
          Applied Employment Laws to Congress--President signed 
        the Congressional Accountability Act into law on 
        January 23, the first public law of the 104th Congress;
          Approved a contract for the first-ever comprehensive 
        independent House audit with Price Waterhouse.
    Prohibited Legislative Service Organizations in the 104th 
Congress, reducing House staff by 96 positions and setting 
course to return over $1 million to the U.S. Treasury.
    Assigned functions to three officers of the House along 
common-sense, operational lines, reversing the unwieldy 
patronage-driven structure that evolved, without rhyme or 
reason, during 40 years of Democratic control:
          Clerk of the House--Legislative operations of the 
        floor;
          Sergeant at Arms--security for facilities, house 
        chambers, members;
          Chief Administrative Officer (CAO)--support services 
        to the House.
    Strengthened and expanded the Office of the Inspector 
General. Staff increased from three to 18; Inspector General 
given genuine independence and responsibility for oversight of 
audit.
    Made the House Oversight Committee truly an oversight, not 
an administrative, committee by:
          Delegating authority for routine processing of 
        vouchers to CAO;
          Revising equipment procurement guidelines for more 
        competitive bidding of contracts for the House.
    Ended the Democrat practice of granting exceptions and 
waivers to the Committee regulations which govern the use of 
Member allowances; instituted consistent policy treating all 
Members the same.
    Instituted the principles of the ``GOP Open House,'' 
transforming the House and the Committee into more accountable 
and transparent institutions, including the following:
          Public disclosure of audit results;
          The THOMAS Internet system, which puts documents on-
        line in real time;
          Open, regular public committee meetings.
    Approved a resolution allowing former employees of the 
House, displaced due to the new Republican majority, to receive 
payment for earned accrued leave.
    Reduced staff at Joint Committee on Printing by 60 percent.
    Transferred House Information Systems to the CAO, keeping a 
promise Democrats made when they created the Office of the 
Director of Non-Legislative and Financial Services (H. Res. 
423, April, 1992) but never fulfilled.

February

    Selected Price Waterhouse as contractor for House audit, 
and Inspector General immediately began work on comprehensive 
financial and performance audits of House operations. Audit 
scheduled for completion July, 1995.
    Reduced 1995 Official Mail Allowance by \1/3\ from 1994 
levels; an average reduction of $60,000 per Member (from 1994 
average of $163,000 to $108,000).

March

    Reduced funding for House committees by $67 million over 
two years, a 30% reduction from the 103rd Congress:
          Unprecedented full accountability for committee 
        spending, all costs open to public disclosure;
          Instituted biennial committee funding process;
          Minority received bigger slice of smaller pie: 14 
        committees increased the minority allocation, majority 
        and minority agree that \1/3\ of resources to minority 
        is goal.

April

    Directed Architect of the Capitol to stop daily delivery of 
ice to House offices, anticipating annual savings of up to 
$500,000.
    Approved FEC authorization bill, a freeze at 1995 levels 
with $1.5 million added for computerization.
    Conducted unprecedented hearing exclusively to gather 
information about proposals to reform use of the frank.

May

    Authorized opening of two House parking lots (more than 800 
spaces) on Capitol Hill for public parking. Net revenues from 
operations to be returned to U.S. Treasury for deficit 
reduction.
    Authorized privatization of House beauty and barber shops, 
to save taxpayers almost $100,000 a year in projected operating 
deficits.
    Approved consistent, fair parking policy for House 
employees, eliminating free parking for lobbyists and extra 
spaces granted as favors to some Members.
    Transferred authority for parking to the Sergeant at Arms, 
improving security for employees and visitors to Capitol Hill.
    Approved reorganization of operations and structure of 
offices of the Clerk of the House and Sergeant at Arms, 
reducing staff by 11% and yielding $1.8 million in savings.
    Approved creation of the Clerk's office Legislative 
Resource Center, combining the House Document Room, Historian, 
Library and the Office of Records & Registration to make the 
living history of the House easily accessible and on-line for 
members, staff and the public.

June

    Authorized reorganization of overall administrative 
functions, reducing House support staff by 34% and saving $7 
million.
    Reduce costs of House Recording and Photography studios by 
over $1.5 million, and instituted greater accountability and 
full cost recovery for operations.
    Ended availability of House recording studio within 60 days 
of primary and general election to members seeking public 
office, unless that election is not contested and Member's name 
does not appear on the ballot.
    Authorized issuance of RFP for privatization of House 
postal operations, estimated potential savings of $1 million/
year.
    Authorized closing of House Publications and Distribution 
Service (folding room), encouraging Members to use private 
sector companies that already provide these services.
    Approved the ``Office 2000'' initiative to bring 21st 
century data and voice communications to the House, through 
groupware and integrated, standardized computerization.
    Combined video, audio and data communications into one 
operation, for greater efficiency. Renamed former House 
Information Systems ``House Information Resources'' to reflect 
new mission.

July

    Received results of first-ever comprehensive audit of House 
finances and operations, for period October 1, 1993 through 
December 31, 1994. Financial records in such poor state 
auditors disclaimed any opinion on the financial statements and 
made over 200 recommendations for remedial action.
    Many of the actions recommended by the auditors already 
done by GOP-led Committee on House Oversight.

August

    Unanimously adopted new regulations governing expenditures 
of Member allowances. The Members' Congressional Handbook was 
the first major revision to regulations in years, represented a 
bipartisan effort, approved by the Inspector General, and 
streamlines authority and is a common-sense approach to office 
management.
    Combined three disparate allowances into one Members' 
Representational Allowance, to provide Members' offices with 
flexibility and accountability in their allowance expenditures.
    Required the Finance Office to complete timely 
reimbursement to Members and staff for travel expenses charged 
to American Express. Made Members and staff personally 
responsible for payment of American Express charges as 
recommended by the Price Waterhouse audit.

comprehensive functional requirements for a new House Financial 
Management System, as recommended by the House Audit.

reporting of candidate campaign reports and permitting 
electronic filing of campaign reports directly to the FEC. 
Passed by the House.

November

    Adopted the House Information Systems Program Plan which 
includes the Office 2000 initiative, thereby moving closer to 
implementing the ``CyberCongress Project''.
    Approved Inspector General Annual Audit Plan for 1996, 
continuing the Republican commitment to a new ``open house.''

December

    Adopted a resolution authorizing for the first time the 
public disclosure of Member allowance amounts beginning in 
1996.
    Approved a contract with a private company to operate House 
Postal Operations, as recommended by the House Audit, with an 
anticipated costs savings of $9.8 million over the life of the 
contract.
    Approved issuance of a task order and request for proposals 
(RFP) to conduct a 1995 House Audit, continuing the commitment 
of accountability made in the Contract with America.
    Under the Committee on House Oversight, the House Franking 
Commission adopted a policy to make all franked mass mail 
available for public inspection and photocopying.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                   Washington, DC, January 3, 1995.

            Followup to Comprehensive House Audit Completed

    Dear Colleague: The House Inspector General John Lainhart 
today presented to the Committee on House Oversight and 
bipartisan House Leadership a final report on the results of 
the exhaustive followup audit the House called for unanimously 
in the passage of H. Res. 192 last July.
    Attached is a detailed summary of the Inspector General's 
report. His conclusions in each area provide additional support 
for the findings of the report entitled ``Problems Plagued the 
House's Financial Operations'' released as a part of the 
comprehensive House Audit on July 18, 1995. That report, and 
the ``Report of Independent Accountants'' issued by Price 
Waterhouse, stated that an absence of an effective internal 
control structure meant that ``there could be no assurances 
that all House transactions were properly recorded, accumulated 
and reported in accordance with the rules, policies and 
procedures established by the House.''
    On behalf of the Leadership and the Committee, we 
appreciate your timely responses to the Inspector General and 
assistance in resolving the outstanding issues. We are proud of 
this report and the conclusions it reaches--that the 
transactions at issue were readily resolved once documentation 
was provided and information gathered.
    If you would like a copy of the full report by the 
Inspector General, please call the Committee at x58281 and we 
will be glad to provide it to you.
            Sincerely,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, January 26, 1996.

                       Important: Return of Gifts

    Dear Colleague: As you know, effective January 1, 1996, 
House Rule 52 bans the acceptance of business-related gifts by 
Members of Congress. However, the Committee understands that, 
on occasion, your office may receive an item which falls under 
this prohibition. Because current Franking law prohibits the 
use of the Frank to return gifts, the Committee has adopted an 
interim policy to allow the use of the Members' 
Representational Allowance (MRA) to pay for the postage costs 
associated with returning such gifts. Such postage costs may 
not exceed $100 per month.
    When submitting vouchers for the postage reimbursement, 
Members should clearly state the reason and facts surrounding 
each gift return. As with all reimbursements, this information 
will become public in the Clerk's Report.
    The Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards (Franking 
Commission) is currently reviewing the use of the Frank for 
such gift returns, and will keep your office posted of any 
policy changes.
    If you have any questions, please contact the Committee on 
House Oversight at x58281 or the Franking Commission at x59337.
            Sincerely,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------

                                  Washington, DC, February 5, 1996.
Republican Members,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Republican Colleague: As we begin our February 
district work period, I wanted to send you the enclosed partial 
list of reform accomplishments made by the Committee on House 
Oversight during our first session of the 104th Congress.
    It's important that we keep a perspective on our reform 
accomplishments. I hope that you will be able to take this 
information back to your districts to show how we are changing 
the way the House does business.
    Please contact Stacy Carlson, staff director at the 
Committee on House Oversight at extension x58281 if you need 
any additional background information.
            Sincerely,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.

Re: Fee for use of the attending physician.

Members, the Resident Commissioner and Delegates,
House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight has 
established a fee for use of the Attending Physician during 
1996. Of course, Members may choose not to use the services 
provided by the Attending Physician.
    However, any member using the Attending Physician's Office 
at any time in 1996 must send a personal check made payable to 
the U.S. Treasurer in the amount of $254.31 to the House 
Finance Office (263 Cannon). Please see the attached Fact Sheet 
for an explanation of the fee and the services provided by the 
Attending Physician. You should keep a copy of your canceled 
check as evidence of payment.
    If you or your staff have any questions about the fee for 
use of the Attending Physician please contact Dan Crowley of 
the Republican staff at 225-8281 or Charles Howell of the 
Democratic staff at 225-2061.
            Best regards,

  Tired of Deficits? Tired of Red Ink in the Nation's Balance Sheet? 
     Here's Secretary Rubin's Solution: Use Purple, Green and Blue

    Dear Colleague.: While Republicans remain committed to a 
balanced budget and to replacing the deficit-red ink in our 
country's balance sheet, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. 
Rubin and IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson are using a 
novel method to keep us in the red. They are wasting hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to print 1995 tax forms with decorative 
scenes of mountains, fields and oceans, using splashes of 
purple, green and blue ink.
    Mr. Rubin and Ms. Richardson have found a new way to waste 
taxpayer money--more than $200,000 to decorate tax forms! Maybe 
$200,000 doesn't seem like a lot of money to the IRS, whose FY 
1996 budget is $7.3 billion, but it's a lot of money to the 
American taxpayer.
    The Government Printing and Binding Regulations clearly 
prohibit using more than one color of ink unless there is a 
specific functional purpose, i.e. to highlight a change in tax 
law, or to assist in completing a form. The colors on the 1995 
Tax Forms don't do this. Does Secretary Rubin think that fancy 
covers on 1040 forms will make the taxpayers happy to pay their 
annual tax bill? They'd prefer lower taxes.
                                ------                                

                     Congress of the United States,
                               Joint Committee on Printing,
                                 Washington, DC, February 28, 1996.
Hon. Robert E. Rubin,
Secretary of the Treasury,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Secretary Rubin: In this time of universal support for 
reducing federal government expenditures, the Joint Committee 
on Printing believes that the Internal Revenue Service has 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars needlessly to use four 
different ink colors on 1995 tax form packages. To prevent 
waste of taxpayer money, The Government Printing and Binding 
Regulations severely restrict the instances in which the use of 
additional ink colors are appropriate in the government's 
printed products.
    It appears that the use of four colors on IRS tax forms is 
for decoration only. For example, the ``1995 1040 Forms and 
Instructions'' uses purple, green, and blue (in addition to 
black) ink on its cover to illustrate mountains, flowers and 
the ocean, respectively. The Committee would certainly 
appreciate knowing your justification for using taxpayer money 
for this purpose. This is especially pertinent now, when the 
IRS is claiming a shortage of funds and reducing services and 
staff as a result.
    Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look 
forward to your reply, which I hope to receive no later than 
March 8, 1996.
            Sincerely,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
                                ------

                                    Washington, DC, March 29, 1996.
Members, the Resident Commissioner, and Delegates.
    Dear colleague: If you are anticipating the need to make 
changes to your current equipment and furnishings inventory 
during the remainder of the 104th Congress, please take into 
consideration the following Committee regulations:
    In an election year, purchases of new and replacement 
equipment and furnishings are restricted to one-time purchases 
after May 31, or the date on which a Member is defeated, or 
announces or takes steps evidencing an intent to retire or run 
for another office, whichever occurs first.
    No other transactions, e.g., removal of equipment or 
furnishings from inventory, transfers of equipment or 
furnishings between Washington and/or district offices, will be 
processed during an election year after May 31, or the date on 
which a Member is defeated, or announces or takes other steps 
evidencing an intent to retire or run for another office, 
whichever occurs first.
    These restrictions do not apply to Members who, after their 
primary election, are unopposed in the general election, nor do 
they apply to leased or rented equipment.
    If you have any questions, please contact the Committee on 
House Oversight at 225-8281 (majority), or 225-2061 (minority).
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                  User's Guide Fact Sheet, March, 1996

    This revision to the User's Guide, effective April 1, 1996, 
is issued by the Committee on House Oversight. Its provisions 
are issued as regulation and replace those found in the 
September, 1995, edition.
    Listed below are the specific changes occurring in the 
April, 1996, User's Guide. Please contact the Committee on 
House Oversight at 225-8281 if you have questions.

General changes

    New sections on software and telecommunications equipment, 
including information on cellular telephones, have been added.
    New entries have been added to the list of definitions.

Policy changes

    Offices will now be required to leave maintenance arranged 
under the approved list when they replace half or more of their 
existing file servers or workstations.
    Offices may now purchase used equipment in the same fashion 
as new equipment.
    In order to protect offices from possible House Rule 45 
violations, offices returning equipment to the vendor after 60 
or more days following delivery will be charged a rental fee of 
4.2% of the purchase cost per month from the date of delivery.
    Travel costs for vendors may now be paid out of the 
applicable office funds.
    Offices are now allowed to use a CMS vendor which is other

on compatibility issues.
    Software purchases with a cost above $350 per package may 
only be reimbursed after the office receives a written 
recommendation from their TSR.

Leasing equipment

    Offices may use either the standard lease control offered 
by the CAO or independently arranged leases. Independently 
arranged leases must be sent to OSM for review.
    Leases may not exceed the elected or appointed term of 
office unless they allow for cancellation, without penalty, at 
the departure of the Member or Officer.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                    Washington, DC, March 29, 1996.
Members, the Resident Commissioner, and Delegates.
    Dear Colleague: If you are anticipating the need to make 
changes to your current equipment and furnishings inventory 
during the remainder of the 104th Congress, please take into 
consideration the following Committee regulations:
    In an election year, purchases of new and replacement 
equipment and furnishings are restricted to one-time purchases 
after May 31, or the date on which a Member is defeated, or 
announces or takes other steps evidencing an intent to retire 
or run for another office, whichever occurs first.
    No other transactions, e.g., removal of equipment or 
furnishings from inventory, transfers of equipment or 
furnishings between Washington and/or district offices, will be 
processed during an election year after May 31, or the date on 
which a Member is defeated, or announces or takes other steps 
evidencing an intent to retire or run for another office, 
whichever occurs first.
    These restrictions do not apply to Members who, after their 
primary election, are unopposed in the general election, nor do 
they apply to leased or rented equipment.
    If you have any questions, please contact the Committee on 
House Oversight at 225-8281 (majority), or 225-2061 (minority).
            Best regards,

                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------

Federal Buildings and Lands Act,'' the Committee on House 
Oversight has taken action to ensure that minors do not

    All cigarette vending machines will be removed by May 1, 
1996. To provide Members and staff continued access, one

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                    Washington, DC, April 24, 1996.

            Town Hall Meeting and Broadcast Time Regulations

    Dear Colleague: As you know, the Committee on House 
Oversight unanimously adopted new regulations governing the 
combined Members' Representational Allowance (MRA) last August. 
As stated on Page 1 of the Handbook, the regulations provide 
members with increased flexibility in managing their offices.
    On Page 36 of the Handbook issued last September, a Town 
Hall meeting is defined as: ``An official meeting a Member 
holds within their district for their constituents to 
facilitate the exchange of information regarding issues 
directly relating to the Member's official and representational 
duties.'' A Member may determine that they prefer to reach 
their constituents for a town hall meeting format through an 
interactive, radio call-in show, rather than in a conventional 
town hall meeting held in a single location.
    On October 13, 1995 the Committee clarified that the 
Handbook prohibits the purchase of any television broadcast 
time. This was restated in the Committees' November ``House 
Oversight Resource'' newsletter. There has been no change to 
this television prohibition.
    The Committee on House Oversight's responsibility is to 
ensure that taxpayer funds are used only to support Members' 
official and representational duties. The Handbook regulations 
reflect this responsibility. Ultimately, Members, along with 
their constituents, will determine whether they are serving 
their district and using taxpayer funds appropriately. A town 
hall meeting held on the radio may allow constituents to 
participate in far greater numbers than has been typically the 
case.
    We recognize that we are in a technological age where 
communication can take place in many forms. Members should not 
be constrained from spending official funds in a way that 
results in greater communication with their constituents, when 
all spending is publicly disclosed, leading ultimately to 
greater accountability than in any previous Congress.
    Please call House Oversight at x58281 if you have any 
questions.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                    Washington, DC, April 30, 1996.

                        House Employment Counsel

Members, Delegates, the Resident Commissioner and House Officers.
    Dear Colleague: The Congressional Accountability Act of 
1995 (Public Law 104-1) requires all House employing offices to 
comply with various employment and workplace laws made 
applicable to the House by the Act. In order to provide House 
employers with advice and guidance relating to their employment 
policies and practices, the Committee on House Oversight has 
established the Office of House Employment Counsel, which is 
administered by the Clerk under the bipartisan direction of the 
Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee.
    This office will be operated on a strictly nonpartisan 
basis, and all contacts with the Employment Counsel will be 
confidential (except that the amount of any cash settlement 
offer must be approved in accordance with H. Res. 401 Sec. 2). 
The Employment Counsel will be available to provide review of 
personnel policies, to answer specific questions on the laws 
and regulations made applicable to the House by the 
Congressional Accountability Act, to represent House employers 
during employment grievance proceedings, and to help House 
offices formulate requests for regulatory interpretations and 
guidance from the Office of Compliance.
    The Office of House Employment Counsel, which is located in 
room 433 Cannon HOB, will open on May 1, 1996. The Employment 
Counsel, Mr. Jeffery C. Poll, can be reached at x57075. Please 
contact Committee staff, Dan Crowley at x58281 (Majority) or 
Charlie Howell at x52061 (Minority), if you have any questions 
about this new office, or about Committee policies and 
regulations relating to employment of staff.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                


                         Summary Intern Program

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                        Washington DC, May 7, 1996.
    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight will 
continue the traditional bicameral Congressional Intern 
Program. Attached is a list of summer housing opporutnities 
that may assist you in helping interns find accommodations.
    We also plan to publish a handbook for interns and schedule 
speakers throughout the months of June, July and August. 
Further details will follow shortly.
    Please feel free to contact Kerrie Freeborn at x5-8281 with 
any questions or suggestions.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
                                ------                                


                      Artistic Discovery Expenses

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                      Washington, DC, May 10, 1996.
    Dear Colleague: Several offices have been calling with 
questions regarding the reimbursability of expenses related to 
``An Artistic Disovery,'' specifically regarding the procedure 
for shipping the artwork back to the district.
    To clarify any confusion about the reimbursability of these 
expenses, outlined below are the Members' Congressional 
Handbook regulations regarding ``An Artistic Discovery.''
          Ordinary and necessary expenses related to the 
        support of ``Artistic Discovery,'' the congressional 
        art competition, are authorized if they fall within a 
        category of authorized official expenses (see Members' 
        Representational Allowance: Official Expenses section 
        beginning on page 150).
          Expenses may include advertisements, printing and 
        production of correspondence, indistrict travel for 
        Clerk Hire employees, and expenses related to shipping 
        and handling of the winning entry between the district 
        and Washington, D.C., via postal services. The Member 
        may not use the Frank to ship or mail the winning 
        entry.
    If you have any further questions regarding the 
reimbursability of such expenses or to receive a copy of the 
Member's Congressional Handbook, please contact the Committee's 
Office of Member Services at x58281. If you have any questions 
regarding the art compeition, please contact Dave with 
Representative Pallone at x54671, or Michelle with 
Representative Gekas at x54328.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,

                                      Washington, DC, June 4, 1996.

1996 Intern Handbook. It provides information on a wide range 
of issues, from office environment to the legislative process.
    Please contact Kerrie Freeborn at x58281 if you have any 
questions or comments.
            Best regards,

                          House of Representatives,

                The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1996

                                Findings

    (1) Our republican form of government is strengthened when 
voters choose their Representatives in elections that are free 
of corruption or the appearance of corruption.
    (2) Corruption or the appearance of corruption in elections 
may evidence itself in many ways:
          (a) Voters who democratically elect Representatives 
        must believe they are fairly represented by those they 
        elect. The current election laws have led many to 
        believe that the interests of those who actually vote 
        for their Representatives are less important than those 
        who cannot vote, but who can influence an election by 
        their contributions to the candidates.
          (b) Failure to disclose, or to timely disclose, those 
        who contribute and how much they contribute, 
        unnecessarily withholds information voters need to cast 
        ballots with complete confidence, thereby increasing 
        the belief of, or the appearance of corruption.
          (c) The diminishing role of political parties, 
        despite parties' long-standing role in advancing broad 
        national agendas, in assisting the election of party 
        candidates and in organizing members, has relatively 
        enhanced groups that pursue narrow interests. This 
        relative shift of influence has been interpreted by 
        some as corrupting the election process.
          (d) Complicated and obsolete election laws and rules 
        discourage citizens from becoming candidates, allow for 
        coerced involuntary payments for political purposes, 
        fail to keep contribution amounts current with 
        inflation, and fail to provide reasonable compensating 
        contribution limits for candidates who run against 
        candidates who exercise their constitutional right of 
        spending their own resources. The current state of laws 
        and rules are such that if they do not corrupt, at the 
        very least they unduly hinder fair, honest and 
        competitive elections.

                  Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1996

                   restore local control of elections

    Restore local control of campaign finance--raise a majority 
of funds from residents of a candidate's district.

                   strengthen the role of individuals

    1. Restore strength of individual contributors--equalize 
PAC and individual contribution limits.
    2. Restore the value of the dollar--index individual 
contribution limit.
    3. Stop bundling by PACs and Lobbyists.
    4. Eliminate Leadership PACs.
    5. Independent Expenditures must be truly independent.
    6. Require annual renewal of wage check-off for corporate 
and union PAC contributions.

                      strengthen political parties

    1. All contributions to and from parties are indexed.
    2. Individual contributions to parties are limited to 
indexed amounts, but not subject to an aggregate limit.
    3. Ban non-federal money from federal elections.
    4. Expand party grassroots activities and party 
communications with members.
    5. Allow political parties to match incumbent warchest 
carryover.

             stop wealthy candidates from buying elections

    1. Political parties may match wealthy candidate's personal 
contributions above individual contribution limit.
    2. If a wealthy candidate raises over $150,000 in personal 
funds, lift individual contribution limits for all candidates 
up to total amount of funds raised by wealthy candidate.

 timely reporting, increased disclosure, more information to candidates

    Last minute contributions of $1,000 and independent 
expenditures must be reported within 24 hours, instead of 
current 48 hours.
    Require reports to aggregate activity on a per-election 
basis, to provide a better picture of contributions received 
and expenditures made in connection with each election.
    Require campaign committees to report payments of $500 or 
more made by an intermediary for the benefit of the campaign.
    Require the FEC to draft regulations in a manner that has 
the least restrictive effect on First Amendment rights of 
freedom of speech and assembly, a reviewing court may set aside 
FEC actions that do not conform to these principles.
    Clarifies that FEC may issue written responses to written 
requests where the law is unambiguous and provide ``safe harbor 
protection'' if questioner acts in good faith, relying upon the 
written response.
    Allows a respondent to a complaint to request the right to 
present oral argument before FEC.
    Requires FEC to compile, publish and regularly update, a 
complete index of advisory opinions.
    Changes the name of the standard of initiation of action to 
``a reason to investigate a possible violation . . . that has 
occurred or is about to occur;'' from the current name of ``a 
reason to believe * * * that a person has committed or is about 
to commit a violation;''
    Permits corporations to communicate with any officers or 
employees of the corporation, versus current restriction on 
communicating only with executive or administrative personnel.
    Permits unlimited solicitation by corporations or labor 
organizations of their officers and employees and members; 
increases threshold at which unions and corporations must 
protect confidentiality of individual PAC contributors from $50 
to $100.
    Broadens protection against use of force, discrimination, 
financial reprisals or threats to coerce contributions for 
candidate committees, in addition to current protection against 
coercion for PAC contributions.
    Eliminates requirements that grassroots citizen activity, 
with a value of $100 or less, on behalf of federal candidates 
must be reported.

           Disclosure of Members' Representational Allowance

    Dear Colleague: The first quarterly report of the Statement 
of Disbursement of the House of Representatives (Statement) for 
1996 will be published shortly. For the first time, the 
Statement will include the amount of each Member's 1996 
Members' Representational Allowance (MRA). The increased 
disclosure was approved by the Committee on House Oversight on 
December 13, 1995. The numbers will be broken down into two 
parts, the total allowance and the franking sub-limit.
    As a reminder, the allowance is calculated for each member 
based on the formulas shown on the reverse.
    The formulas are long-standing and were used when Members' 
allowances were in distinct and separate funds, the intention 
was to produce an equitable allowance for all Members based on 
geographical location, and varying population and costs in 
their districts. This approach is under review to determine its 
equity in light of the single MRA fund.
    Please call either the majority (x58281) or the minority 
(x52061) staff with any questions you may have.
            Best regards,

The Most Fundamental Election Reform Ever Offered by a House Majority: 
Majority-In-District; PAC Limits = Individual Limits; Protect Value of 
 Individual Contributions; Electoral Competition; Empower Parties! No 
                 Spending Limits. No Taxpayer Financing

    Dear Republican Colleague: H.R. 3760 is the most 
fundamental election reform ever advanced by a Congressional 
Majority. For years, campaign ``reformers'' have tried to 
restrict First Amendment rights, reduce electoral competition 
and impose public and taxpayers subsidies. H.R. 3760 is 
different.

Majority in District: Power to Constituents!

    Majority-in-district reform will transform American 
politics. Candidates must raise less from Washington special 
interests and more from constituents.

 Protect Value of Constitutional Right to Contribute

    Instead of constricting First Amendment rights, H.R. 3760 
will protect the original value of the $1,000 individual 
contribution limit set by Congress in the Watergate year of 
1974. Now, 20 years later, the value of that $1,000, and the 
constitutional right it represents, has been slashed 2/3 by 
inflation. H.R. 3760, by indexing the contribution levels, 
restores the constitutional right to contribute to the value 
Congress set in 1974!

Stronger Parties; More Efficient Use of Funds = Competitive Elections

    Instead of spending limits that limit electoral 
competition, H.R. 3760 will increase competition by empowering 
political parties. It will NOT increase the unlimited amounts 
individuals can now give to our national and 50 state political 
parties, but it will allow parties to help challenges, 
counteract the influence of wealthy candidates, and to 
effectively organize at the grassroots and communicate with 
members, just like unions do today! H.R. 3760 preserves the 
principle that only funds raised under federal law can be used 
to advocate the election of federal candidates.

Reform Republicans Can Support with Pride

    H.R. 3760 puts the voter in the driver's seat and takes 
power out of Washington. It is a good bill for Republicans, and 
a good bill for the political process in America!
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.

   Republican Campaign Reform: ``May Point the Way to the Future''; 
``Essentially Reverses the Traditional Definition of Reform''; ``It May 
    Offer a Way Out of This Maze'', (Washington Post, July 17, 1996)

    Dear Colleague: As we head into floor debate on campaign 
finances reform, I recommend the following.
            Best regards,

          [From the Washington Post, Wednesday, July 17, 1996]

                    A New Twist on Campaign Finance

                          (By David S. Broder)

    House Republicans have come forward with a new approach to 
the conundrum of campaign finance reform. It won't become law 
this year, but it may point the way to the future.
    The bill that came out of the House Oversight Committee 
last week, headed for an early floor vote, essentially reverses 
the traditional definition of reform--drying up private 
contributions to campaigns and limiting the cost of our 
elections--and acknowledges that as both a practical and 
constitutional matter, those constraints are unworkable.
    Instead, it takes the approach that, in the inevitable mix 
of money sources, everything possible should be done to enhance 
the role of two groups: a congressman's own constituents and 
the political parties.
    Before explaining why this approach--which is very 
controversial--may make more sense than that advocated in the 
past by Republicans, Democrats and nonpartisan reform groups, 
let me pick a fight with the House Republicans on a collateral 
issue.
    At the same time the Oversight Committee under Chairman 
Bill Thomas (R-Calif.) recommended steps to deregulate the 
financing of campaigns, the House Appropriations Committee 
under Chairman Bob Livingston (R-La.) restricted the budget of 
the money watchdog, the Federal Election Commission (FEC).
    Republicans can't have it both ways. If you move to 
``empower'' constituents and parties to play a bigger role in 
campaigns, as they would do, you cannot shut down the main 
instrument of disclosure, the FEC. Livingston's committee even 
ordered the FEC press staff--which is at the center of the 
public disclosure process--cut from five persons to two. Two 
people to handle the thousands of inquiries from the press and 
public about who is paying for our presidential and 
congressional campaigns? Give me a break!
    To understand the logic of the Thomas approach, you have to 
know two things. First, as a matter of constitutional law, the 
Supreme Court, almost every time it decides a campaign finance 
case, rules against restraints on political speech, which it 
rightly regards as the core value protected by that part of the 
First Amendment. Last month, in the most recent of those 
decisions, it blew a big hole in the restrictions on what 
political parties may spend in connection with congressional 
campaigns.
    Second, the current scheme of regulation is driving more 
and more interest groups--all across the spectrum--to shift 
their priority away from contributions to parties and 
candidates and instead is encouraging them to boost their 
preferred politicians either through ``independent 
expenditure'' campaigns or indirectly through ``issue 
advocacy'' campaigns.
    The result has been that the money tide is rising--but the 
disclosure requirements that apply to old-fashioned 
contributions to, and spending by, parties and candidates are 
being evaded.
    Classic reformers--Common Cause and its allies--have 
scrambled around for years to find ways to stem the tide. It 
hasn't worked.
    Thomas has rethought the problem, and come up with a number 
of sensible ideas. His is far from a perfect proposal, but at 
least it moves the debate in a more productive direction.
    First, he would require candidates to raise at least half 
their money in their home states or districts. Second, he would 
lift the $1,000 limit on individual contributions (unchanged, 
despite inflation, since 1974) to $2,500 and index it for the 
future. He would let individuals contribute virtually unlimited 
amounts to political parties, and let the parties spend that 
money to eliminate some of the most important barriers 
challengers for Congress now face. The party, for example, 
could move in money to offset the amount a wealthy opponent 
spends on his or her own race, or the amount an incumbent 
builds up in the preelection year in order to intimidate any 
possible challenger.
    Democrats claim that the proposed rules would help the 
GOP--and they might, at least initially. But even Democrats 
concede that there is a logic to Thomas's approach beyond 
partisanship. In time, it may offer a way out of this maze.
                                ------

   Attention: Important Change to the Election Year Equipment Policy

Members, the Resident Commissioner, and Delegates.
    Dear Colleague: It has come to the Committee's attention 
that the May 31, 1996, election year equipment and furnishings 
policy is unnecessarily restrictive. Therefore, the Committee 
has modified this policy:
          Effective immediately, prohibitions on removals or 
        transfers of equipment prior to an election applies 
        only to retiring or defeated Members.
          Other Members are not subject to the prohibition on 
        equipment and furnishing transfers, removals, etc. as 
        outlined on page 1 of the User's Guide to Purchasing 
        Equipment, Software, and Related Services, and may 
        transfer, remove, etc., their equipment and 
        furnishings.
          Only Members who have lost the 1996 primary or 
        general election, or have announced or taken other 
        steps evidencing an intent to retire or run for another 
        office, are subject to this prohibition.
          The one-time purchase restriction for new and 
        replacement equipment and furnishings after May 31, 
        1996 remains unchanged.
    Requests for equipment and furnishing transactions for 
Members who have lost the 1996 primary or general election, or 
have announced or taken other steps evidencing an intent to 
retire or run for another office, are considered only when the 
Member provides the Committee on House Oversight with 
documentation sufficient to demonstrate their bona fide intent 
to request such removals, transfers, etc., prior to May 31, 
1996.
    Please contact the Committee at x58281 (Majority) or x52061 
(Minority) if you have any questions.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.

                   Republican Campaign Finance Reform

                     ``A Novel Version of Reform''
   ``It Departs Rather Radically From 20 Years of Reform Orthodoxy''
  ``Comports Rather Well with Political and Constitutional Realities''
                            ``Worth a Try''
           So Says the Cleveland Plain Dealer (July 18, 1996)

    Dear Colleagues: The Republican Campaign Finance Reform Act 
of 1996 continues to gain support.
            Best regards,
                                                       Bill Thomas.

            [From The Plain Dealer, Thursday, July 18, 1996]

                          Mission Improbable?

    Campaign-finance reform is a perennial: It comes up every 
year, dies back every year and survives despite clumsy pruning. 
The only thing growing faster and thicker than reform proposals 
is the amount of money in federal campaigns. That won't change. 
How it's dealt with could, beginning with a novel version of 
reform--known as the Thomas bill--due before the House today.
    Two previous tries have fallen short of passage, 
deservedly. A ``bipartisan'' reform bill that stalled in the 
Senate proposes further limiting the amount of donors' money 
allowed in campaigns for federal office and replacing chunks of 
it with public--i.e., tax-paid--funding. A Democratic 
alternative likewise proposes limits on individual donors, tax-
paid benefits for candidates, public funding for state parties, 
protections likeliest to protect organizations likeliest to 
make indirect contributions to Democrats (e.g., Emily's List) 
and restrictions on organizations likeliest to make indirect 
contributions to Republicans (e.g. Christian Coalition). That 
Democratic proposal failed to get out of committee but may make 
it onto the House floor today in some similar incarnation.
    In part, these proposals failed to pass muster because some 
limitations they proposed don't pass muster with the First 
Amendment. And some that do will eventually be got around.
    Today, the House is set to take up a Republican bill with a 
different tack: it acknowledges the apparently inescapable 
reality that private money will find its way into federal 
election campaigns. It also acknowledges that this need not be 
unrelievedly bad.
    First, the Republicans propose to limit the amount of 
direct contributions to candidates for Congress only by the 
amount they can raise from individual citizens in their 
districts. Candidates could accept no more from out-of-district 
PACS and organizations than they could raise from in-district 
individuals.
    Second, as dependence on individual contributions rises, 
the Republicans would raise limits on individual contributions. 
Adjusted for inflation since limitations were first instituted 
in 1974, limits on individual contributions would rise from 
$1,000 to $2,500 this year. To achieve parity as to individuals 
and PACS, PAC contribution limits would fall from $5,000 to 
$2,500 this year. Henceforth, both individual and PAC 
contributions would be indexed to the Consumer Price Index.
    Third, the Republican proposal attempts to address two 
realities: ``Soft money''--money raised and spent by political 
parties on behalf of themselves and their candidates and raised 
by organizations and spent indirectly on behalf of candidates--
has soared as ``hard money'' (direct contributions to 
candidates) has been limited. And that seems OK by a Supreme 
Court reluctant to limit how groups and individuals may spend 
their own money on their own political agendas. The Republican 
proposal would distinguish among what types of ``soft money'' 
may be spent on what types of political activity. It would lift 
some restrictions on contributions to let candidates match 
spending by opponents who can spend unlimited personal funds in 
pursuit of public office.
    Fourth, the Republican proposal acknowledges that the best 
protection against undue influence of money in federal 
campaigns is timely disclosure of anybody who's contributing 
anything to any candidate. It engages the convenience and speed 
of the World Wide Web in this regard.
    Common Cause and other ``public interest'' special 
interests call this bill ``The Fat Cat Liberation Act of 
1996.'' They prefer artificial limits on what individuals and 
groups may spend on any one campaign and on totals contributed 
during any election year. They prefer that taxpayers finance 
federal campaigns to keep corporations, unions and PACs from 
buying access to and influence with Congress. Failing that 
(again), they seek at least enough tax-paid benefits to entice 
candidates to lower the megabuck levels of campaign spending.
    Given the First Amendment, that's mission impossible. It's 
also mission unpreferable. In the name of fairness, they would 
mandate passive citizen financial participation--and outlaw 
active citizen financial participation.
    Yes, wealthy individuals try to buy public office. But they 
seldom succeed. Yes, the very rich, corporations, unions and 
PACs get access to Congress that ordinary citizens don't. But 
the rich, too, have First Amendment rights, occasionally good 
suggestions and diverse politics. And corporations, unions and 
PACs are composed of ordinary citizens with common interests 
and no small expertise. They also are increasingly opposed by 
other ordinary citizens grouped by their common interests and 
eager to share their contrary expertise.
    The Thomas bill may prove to be mission improbable: It 
departs rather radically from 20 years of reform orthodoxy. But 
it comports rather well with political and constitutional 
realities. That alone makes it worth a try.
                                ------

    Dear Republican Colleague: When the Campaign Finance Reform 
Act of 1996 is considered on the floor Thursday, July 25, 1996, 
an amendment to the base text, HR 3820, will be offered. The 
amendment makes the following changes:

        201)

    Amendment to HR 3820:
          Individual contribution limit $1,000 per election
          PAC contribution limit $5,000 per cycle ($2,500 per 
        election)
          Sets party contribution limits at two-times current 
        law
          Individual aggregate contribution limit $100,000 per 
        cycle ($50,000 per year)
          Include individual contributions to parties in 
        aggregate $100,000 individual contribution limit
          All limits indexed prospectively by CPI

Contribution limits when candidate spends large amount of personal 
        funds (section 103)

    Amendment to HR 3820:
          When wealthy candidate spends over $150,000 of 
        personal funds in general election, individual and 
        party contribution limits are lifted up to amount of 
        personal spending by wealthy candidate, and 
        contribution limits for PACs are also lifted, up to 
        $25,000.

                Members, Committee Web Site Regulations

Members, Delegates, Resident Commissioner, Committee Chairs, 
    Leadership, and Officers.
    Dear Colleague: The Committee on House Oversight has 
adopted regulations that, as of September 1, 1996, will govern 
the content of Member and committee official Web sites. These 
regulations supersede the ``Electronic Communications'' section 
on page 20 of the Members' Congressional Handbook and 
complement the ``Internet Policy'' section on page 37 of the 
Committees' Congressional Handbook.
    As of September 1, 1996, Members and Committee Web sites 
must be in compliance with the regulations (as shown on the 
reverse) and summarized below:
          The creation and operation of Members' official Web 
        sites must be in support of the Members' official and 
        representational duties to the district from which 
        elected.
          Office Web sites may not: include personal, 
        political, or campaign information; include 
        advertisements or endorsements for private individuals 
        or entities; and directly link to Web sites created or 
        operated by campaign or partisan political 
        organizations.
          H.I.R. will display an exit notice stating that users 
        are leaving the House of Representatives, prior to 
        linking to a non-House Web site. This notice will 
        include a disclaimer that neither the Member nor the 
        House are responsible for the content of linked sites.
          For security purposes, all official Web sites must be 
        located on the HOUSE.GOV host-domain. Member offices 
        may choose between maintaining their sites in their 
        office or through the use of H.I.R. services.
    These regulations will be under constant review by the 
Committee. Additionally, the Committee will continue to work 
with H.I.R on security issues, including the examination of 
technological applications to insure that downloading can occur 
without jeopardizing security or introducing viruses into the 
House system.
    The Committee will be holding briefings on these 
regulations; times and dates will be announced. Please contact 
Committee staff with any questions at 225-8281 (majority) and 
225-2061 (minority).
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,

                            1995 House Audit

    Dear Colleague: The House Inspector General and the Price 
Waterhouse auditors today presented the audit of the House's 
1995 financial statements at a meeting of the Committee on 
House Oversight. The Inspector General testified that he had 
found ``significant improvement'' since the first-ever House 
audit was completed last year.
    In their testimony, the Price Waterhouse team said that the 
House has aggressively addressed the shortcomings found in the 
first audit and that we have accomplished much in a 
comparatively short period of time. They added that in their 
experience such prompt implementation of a system of this 
magnitude was rare, especially since the House had relatively 
little upon which to build, and that our effort must be 
considered a solid achievement.
    Attached is a copy of the audit for your review. For 
additional copies, please contact the House Document Room or 
the Committee on House Oversight.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.

                                Washington, DC, September 19, 1996.

     Important: Franking Alert--Re: Mass Mailing Public Disclaimer

    Dear Colleague: The Legislative Branch Appropriations Act 
of 1997 includes language which requires all mass mailings to 
contain a public disclaimer statement effective October 1, 
1996.
    Each mass mailing sent by a Member of Congress must display 
the following wording: ``This Mailing Was Prepared, Published, 
and Mailed at Taxpayer Expense.'' The notice must appear 
prominently on the face, or envelope or outside cover of the 
mail matter being sent and printed in type size not smaller 
than 7 point.
    A mass mailing is defined as any unsolicited mailing of 500 
or more pieces of substantially identical content in a session

                            Record of Reform

    Dear Republican Colleague: Since January of 1995, the new 
Republican Majority has dramatically reformed and changed the 
operations of the House of Representatives. Common sense 
reforms and privatization efforts have saved $150 million in 
taxpayer dollars, resulted in a $60 million reduction in the 
House' budget. We have kept our commitment to the American 
taxpayer, and have a proven record of reform.
    The attached chart, as presented by the Speaker at today's 
Republican Conference, summarizes the changes and the savings 
we have accomplished. Also attached is a draft opinion piece, 
``Republican Reforms Save $150 million'' to send to the media 
in your district. The chart and opinion are also available on 
the Committee's Home Page, under ``Record of Reform,'' at 
http://www.house.gov/cho/welcome.htm.
    For more information, please contact Committee staff at 
x58281.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.

                  Republican Reforms Save $150 Million

    Did you know that the House of Representatives used to 
spend $500,000 each year to deliver ice and $100,000 on 
subsidized haircuts for politicians on Capitol Hill? In the 
last two years, House Republicans have stopped these and other 
wasteful spending schemes inherited from House Democrats. Using 
common-sense and a sharp budget knife, Republicans have saved 
$150 million through internal reforms. We have dramatically cut 
our own budget and provided an example for how to cut the cost 
of the rest of government. Without fancy commissions, 
bureaucratic reports or multi-year studies we have, quite 
simply, just done it.
    The House was riddled with scandal under Democratic 
control. Remember the House Post Office, the House Bank, and 
prison sentences for abuse of taxpayer funds? Republicans were 
never shy in our criticism of how the Democrats ran the House. 
When we won majority status and became responsible for managing 
the House, and its $730 million annual budget, we had to prove 
ourselves. We said we could do it better, and we have.
    We are spending $60 million less to run the House than was 
spent in the 103rd Congress, and will return an additional $50 
million to the Treasury. We saved $470,000 by canceling a 
parking lot and a warehouse lease, earned $141,000 by 
auctioning off old, obsolete furniture that Democrats paid 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to store. We opened another 
parking lot for public parking and all revenues go straight to 
the Treasury for deficit reduction. We eliminated special-
interest Legislative Service Organizations, and sent over $1 
million back to the Treasury for that, too.
    And House Republicans have sliced our own pie. We 
eliminated three House committees, cut over 600 positions from 
committee staffs and saved $70 million in employee salaries. We 
slashed Members' mail budgets by an average of $67,000 each. We 
contracted out postal operations to the US Postal Service and 
to a private company, saving $10 million over the next seven 
years. We now use private businesses for our printing and 
folding services, saving over $2 million in the first year. We 
weigh the cost of a service versus its benefits, and if it 
doesn't measure up we eliminate it. The reality of limited 
resources, faced by American families everyday, is now our 
reality as well.
    Every private contractor now operating in the House has 
hired our former employees. These employees are now on a 
private sector payroll, rather than the taxpayer's dime. And 
now they have opportunities for advancement; this was not 
possible in the closed, patronage-based House controlled by the 
Democrats.
    The Contract with America called for the first-ever, 
independent comprehensive audit of the House finances (under 
the Democrats, the House never had an independent audit of its 
books). The first audit was a dismal report on the Old House. 
Among the findings were that a pen and paper ledger system kept 
track of funds. The $234 million House bank balance was written 
in ink on a piece of faded green ledger paper, and when the 
balance changed, the number was crossed out and corrected. We 
have implemented a computerized financial management system, 
something most businesses did decades ago.
    And then we continued, by auditing our own books, and 
dramatic improvement was shown after our first year as the 
House' managers. So long as Republicans control the House, 
taxpayers will know how their money is spent, and whether or 
not it is being wasted.
    Under forty years of Democratic control, House spending was 
bloated and wasteful. While families were making sacrifices to 
make ends meet, the deficit increased, the House budget 
increased. In the last two years, House Republicans have shown 
the will and the way to reduce the size of our slice of 
government. We have proven that we can put our own House in 
order and keep the promises we make to the American taxpayer.

                        TEN COMMONSENSE REFORMS OF THE 104TH CONGRESS REPUBLICAN MAJORITY

              Franking Guidelines for Historical Calendars

    Dear Colleague: Realizing that many Members' offices are 
beginning to prepare their U.S. Capitol Historical calendars 
and House of Representatives wall calendars for mailing later 
this year, the Commission would like to advise you of the 
following regulations and provisions of law. Pursuant to 
section 3210(a)(3)(G) of Title 39, United States Code, the wall 
calendars and the U.S. Capitol Historical calendars that are 
purchased with Federal funds are frankable. The following will 
be helpful when preparing the calendars.
    1. The calendars must be submitted to the Commission for 
approval if you are mailing 500 or more, or if you are seeking 
reimbursement for printing a message, including your name, on 
the calendars. Please submit any intended message before 
printing it on the calendars. It is not necessary to submit the 
entire calendar; you may simply copy the front cover and submit 
that with the intended message. Because of the mass 
communications ban 90 days prior to an election, no more than 
499 calendars can be mass distributed prior to November 6, 
1996.
    2. Holiday greetings are prohibited on any mass mailing, 
pursuant to section 3210(a)(5)(B)(iii) of title 39, U.S.C. One 
recommendation for a calendar message is ``Best Wishes.''
    We hope this information has been helpful. If you have any 
questions, please call the Commission majority staff at x59337 
or minority staff at x52061.
            Sincerely,

    Dear Colleague: We are writing to draw your attention to 
two newly restored rooms on the first floor of the Library of 
Congress Thomas Jefferson Building that are now available for 
use by Members of Congress.
    With the renovation of the Jefferson Building, the Members' 
Room, formerly the House of Representatives Reading Room, has 
been restored to its original beauty and is available to 
Members for congressional meetings and conferences. It can 
accommodate up to 80 people and may be reserved weekdays and 
evenings on a first come basis. The room is not available for 
social events or on a sponsorship basis. Members may reserve 
the room by calling the Library's Congressional Relations 
Office at 7-6577.
    The Jefferson Congressional Reading Room, adjacent to the 
Members' Room, is solely for the use of Members of Congress and 
is open weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Librarians from 
the Congressional Research Service (CRS) are available to 
assist Members with access to CRS services, including CRS 
policy experts and prepared materials. The Reading Room's 
standard reference collection and the large quotation 
collection are complemented with computer access to the CRS 
Home Page, from which Members have access to Library data bases 
as well as the Internet. It is also equipped with cable 
television to provide information on House and Senate 
legislative action and has study carrels with individual 
telephone and data lines for use with laptop computers.
    Questions about the Jefferson Congressional Reading Room's 
services may be directed to the Reading Room (7-8500) or to the 
CRS Director's Office (7-5775). We hope you will visit and use 
the Library of Congress Members' Room and the Jefferson 
Congressional Reading Room.

                Integrity of American Elections at Stake

    Dear Republican Colleague: As your local and state election 
officials prepare for November 5, 1996 the following letter and 
press release, regarding Attorney General Janet Reno's role in 
possible corruption of election practices, may be of assistance 
to them.
    Please contact the Committee on House Oversight, Roman 
Buhler or Stacy Clarson, at x58281 with any questions.
            Best regards,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
                                ------                                


              [News From the Committee on House Oversight]

   Justice Department's Risky Scheme Threatens Integrity of American 
                               Elections

    Chairman Bill Thomas today asked Attorney General Janet 
Reno to direct the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
(``INS'') to immediately release the information that it is 
concealing from Secretaries of State, information which, if 
released, could prevent criminals from deciding the outcome of 
American elections.
    Thomas supports California Secretary of State Bill Jones' 
request, repeated again on Wednesday, October 23, 1996, for the 
INS to release the names of those individuals who were 
naturalized illegally. Jones has requested these names so that 
he can act quickly to remove them from the California voter 
rolls and to ensure the integrity of California's elections.
    The Clinton Administration has admitted to using the 
naturalization process to recruit over one million new voters, 
and has deliberately, in their rush to beat voting registration 
deadlines, omitted criminal history checks which the law 
requires prior to granting U.S. citizenship.
    The Committee on House Oversight has jurisdiction on all 
matters related to federal elections, including corrupt 
elections practices. Thomas called upon Attorney General Reno 
to immediately provide the results of these criminal history 
examinations directly to Secretaries of States throughout the 
country, who can then take steps under state law to ensure the 
integrity of elections in their states and local communities.
    Thomas wrote, ``It is a matter of grave concern that the 
Attorney General of the United States should ever be in the 
position of appearing to condone the corruption of the American 
elections process. The deliberate refusal to follow the law 
that requires criminal background checks on all potential 
citizens has put the cornerstone of our democracy, the people's 
right to vote, in the hands of criminals.''
    ``The greatest victims of this corrupt scheme may be the 
hundreds of thousands of honest immigrants who have complied 
with the law but who will suffer under a cloud of suspicion 
until the INS releases a complete, and accurate record,'' said 
Thomas.
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                              Committee on House Oversight,
                                  Washington, DC, October 24, 1996.
Hon. Janet Reno,
Attorney General of the United States,
Department of Justice, Washington, DC.
    Dear Attorney General Reno: As Chairman of the Committee on 
House Oversight, with jurisdiction on all matters related to 
federal elections, including corrupt elections practices, I 
write to urge you to direct the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service (``INS'') to act immediately and swiftly to release the 
information that it is concealing from Secretaries of State, 
information which, if released, could prevent criminals from 
deciding the outcome of American elections.
    Evidence exists that the INS may have illegally granted 
citizenship to as many as 100,000 felons; 100,000 felons who 
can now register to vote in neighborhoods across the country. 
Local and state government officials are powerless to stop this 
avalanche of illegal registrants, whose illegal votes will 
dilute the legitimate votes of law-abiding American citizens.
    Your risky scheme to grant citizenship without following 
the law threatens to undermine the very foundation of our 
democracy. The granting of citizenship, which leads to the 
right to vote in elections for every local, state and federal 
office is no longer a process which Americans can point to with 
pride, but a practice that corrupts elections. The greatest 
victims of this scheme may be the hundreds of thousands of 
honest immigrants who have complied with the law but who will 
suffer under a cloud of suspicion until the INS releases a 
complete, and accurate record.
    The INS, in its frenzy to meet a politically-imposed quota 
of 1.3 million new U.S. citizens prior to the November, 1996 
elections, has illegally refused to examine criminal 
backgrounds of applicants. Now, because of concerns raised by 
Congress, the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services 
Division has initiated the process of examining the criminal 
history of these applicants. The FBI must immediately provide 
the results of this examination directly to Secretaries of 
States throughout the country, who can then take steps under 
state law to ensure the integrity of elections in their states 
and local communities.
    It is a matter of grave concern that the Attorney General 
of the United States should ever be in the position of 
appearing to condone the corruption of the American elections 
process. The deliberate refusal to follow the law that requires 
criminal background checks on all potential citizens has put 
the cornerstone of our democracy, the people's right to vote, 
in the hands of criminals.
    If the Attorney General will not assist Secretaries of 
State in this process, then we ask that you provide the 
information to the House of Representatives so that we can do 
the job which you refuse to do. Please reply by close of 
business Monday, October 28, 1966 with the results of the FBI's 
criminal checks that have been completed, and on each day 
thereafter any additional results. We will then forward this 
information to Secretaries of State to ensure that on November 
5, 1996 they can do their best to ensure that only those who 
are lawfully entitled to vote exercise that privilege.
            Sincerely,
                                             Bill Thomas, Chairman.
                                ------

                 New Law on the Reporting of Mass Mail

    Dear Colleague: Member offices are required to comply with 
a provision of the FY 1997 Legislative Branch Appropriations 
bill (Public Law 104-197), effective October 1, to report 
comprehensive information on all mass mailings sent by our 
office.
    The law requires that (1) the number of pieces of mass mail 
sent; (2) the number of pieces sent per address; (3) the total 
costs of mass mailings and; (4) the costs per piece of the mass 
mailings of each Members' office be disclosed in the quarterly 
Statement of Disbursements. The Statement will also list those 
Members who fail to comply with this reporting requirement.
    You will soon be sent a Mass Mail Reporting Form from the 
Finance Office on which to record the information, on a 
quarterly basis, required to comply with the law. On the form, 
you must record the details of each mass mailing and send the 
information to the Finance Office shortly after the end of each 
quarter in order to ensure the information is included in the 
quarterly Statement of Disbursements.
    Please call the Committee on House Oversight at x5-8281 if 
you have any questions.
            Best regards,

             Year-End Computer-Related Purchase Information

Members, Resident Commissioner, and Delegates,
U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: We would like to bring the following points 
to your attention relating to any year-end purchase decisions 
you may be making which involve computer equipment.
          Deadline for use of 1996 Funds: In order to use 1996 
        funds, your completed purchase order must be submitted 
        to Office Systems Management (OSM) no later than the 
        close of business on January 2, 1997.
          Revised Minimum Technical Standards: On December 4 
        over eighty staff members attended Committee sponsored 
        sessions to review the technical standards. In response 
        to staff input, several changes have been made and the 
        final standards are attached. Please note these 
        requirements are effective for purchases made with 1997 
        funds.
          Requirements for conversions to a System Integration 
        Contract: In response to feedback regarding these 
        contracts, the requirement that replacing more than 
        half of your existing workstations requires adoption of 
        this contract is eliminated, effective immediately. 
        Replacing more than half of your file servers will 
        continue to require adoption of a System Integrators 
        contract. The Committee will be reviewing this area in 
        more detail in early 1997.

   Congressional Accountability Act--OSHA and ADA Access Provisions:

                     Take Effect on January 1, 1997

Members, the Resident Commissioner, Delegates, Committee Chairmen, and 
    House Officers,
U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Colleague: The Occupational Safety and Health Act 
(OSHA) and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) access 
provisions will apply to the House effective on January 1, 
1997. Under OSHA, House employing offices must be free from 
hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical 
harm. The ADA access provisions prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of disability with respect to programs and services 
provided to the public. Attached are materials on these laws 
compiled by the Office of Compliance and the Office of House 
Employment Counsel.
    In June, 1996, the General Counsel of the Office of 
Compliance completed a thorough OSHA inspection of all House 
workplaces and found that most were free of major hazards 
(individual offices were notified of potential hazards during 
the inspection). The Office of Compliance is required to assist 
House employing offices by arranging for OSHA inspections and 
other technical assistance upon request. To request such 
assistance, contact the Office of General Counsel of the Office 
of Compliance at 724-9250.
    The Committee on House Oversight has established the Office 
of ADA Services, under the Chief Administrative Officer, to 
assist you in accommodating disabilities. The Office of ADA 
Services will provide Members, Committees, Leadership, and 
other House offices with information, training, and support 
services (including special equipment, sign language 
interpreters, braille, TDD phones, etc.) to ensure the 
availability of assistance required by constituents, visitors, 
and employees with disabilities.
    Please contact the Office of ADA Services in room 722 
O'Neill HOB, x53005, for assistance in providing access to the 
programs and services provided by your office to persons with 
disabilities. You may also contact the Office of House 
Employment Counsel, x57075, and staff to the Committee on House 
Oversight, x58281 (majority) and x52061 (minority) are 
available to provide guidance of all Congressional 
Accountability Act issues.
            Best regards,
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman.
                                   Vic Fazio,
                                           Ranking Minority Member.
