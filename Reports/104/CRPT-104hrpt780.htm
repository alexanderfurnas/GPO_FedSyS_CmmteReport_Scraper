 Mr. Shuster, from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
                        submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 3535]

      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

    The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, to whom 
was referred the bill (H.R. 3535) to redesignate a Federal 
building in Suitland, Maryland, as the ``W. Edwards Deming 
Federal Building'', having considered the same, report 
favorably thereon without amendment and recommend that the bill 
do pass.
    Dr. William Edwards Deming was a renowned expert on 
business management. He was born in Powell, Wyoming, attended 
local schools and received his Bachelor of Science degree from 
the University of Wyoming, his Master of Science degree from 
the University of Colorado and his Doctorate from Yale 
University.
    In 1927, Dr. Deming began his public service career with 
the Department of Agriculture as a physicist. He then moved on 
to the Bureau of Census to become the Mathematical Advisor to 
the Chief of the Population Division, where he developed and 
designed statistical sampling techniques for use in the 
national census. His interest in quality and management led him 
to introduce sampling as a quality measurement technique for 
punch card verification and other processing activities in the 
1940 census.
    In 1945, Dr. Deming commenced on a second distinguished 
career as a statistics and management consultant to several 
foreign governments, including Austria, France, Germany, India, 
Turkey, and most notably, Japan.
    Dr. Deming's innovative theories were based on the premise 
that most product defects resulted from management shortcomings 
rather than careless workers. He further posited that 
``inspection after the fact'' was an inferior form of quality 
control, and focused on improving design processes which would 
produce better quality. He argued that enlisting the efforts of 
willing workers to do things correctly the first time, coupled 
with providing them the proper tools, were the key to improving 
product quality.
    It is a fitting tribute to name this Census Bureau facility 
in honor of Dr. Deming.

                        compliance with rule xi

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives:
          (1) The Subcommittee held a hearing and markup on 
        this legislation on July 31, 1996,
          (2) The requirements of section 308(a)(1) of the 
        Congressional Budget Act of 1974 are not applicable to 
        this legislation since it does not provide new budget 
        authority or new or increased tax expenditures;
          (3) The Committee has received no report from the 
        Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of 
        oversight findings and recommendations arrived at under 
        clause 4(C)(2) of rule X of the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives;
          (4) With respect to clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of 
        the Rules of the House of Representatives and Section 
        403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a cost 
        estimate by the Congressional Budget Office was 
        received by the Committee.
    The report follows:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                    Washington, DC, August 6, 1996.
Hon. Bud Shuster,
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of 
        Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 3535, a bill to redesignate a federal building in 
Suitland, Maryland, as the ``W. Edwards Deming Federal 
Building,'' as ordered reported by the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure on August 1, 1996. We 
estimate that enacting H.R. 3535 would result in no significant 
cost to the federal government. The bill would not affect 
direct spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go 
procedures would not apply.
    In addition, H.R. 3535 contains no intergovernmental or 
private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) and would not affect the 
budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is John R. 
Righter.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                     inflationary impact statement

    Under (2)(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives, the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure estimates that enactment of H.R. 3535 will have 
no significant inflationary impact on prices and costs in the 
operation of the national economy.

                          cost of legislation

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires a statement of the estimated cost to 
the United States which will be incurred in carrying out H.R. 
3535, as reported, in fiscal year 1997, and each of the 
following five years. Implementation of this legislation is not 
expected to result in any increased costs to the United States.

                       committee action and vote

    In compliance with clause (2)(l)(2) (A) and (B) of rule XI 
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, at a meeting of 
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on August 1, 
1996, a quorum being present, H.R. 3535 was unanimously 
approved by a voice vote and ordered reported.
