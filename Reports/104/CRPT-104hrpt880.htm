  Mr. Kasich of Ohio, from the Committee on the Budget, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

                    Summary of Committee Activities

              jurisdiction and functions of the committee

    The Committee on the Budget was established by the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974.<SUP>1 The committee has been 
historically responsible for developing and reporting the 
annual congressional budget resolution, and for assembling and 
reporting any reconciliation legislation required by that 
resolution. In the 104th Congress, its jurisdiction was 
expanded to include budget process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget is governed by 
Rule X, clause 1(d) of the Rules of the House of Representatives for 
the 104th Congress. This provision was added to the House Rules by 
section 101 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The basic purpose of the budget resolution is to provide an 
overall framework and plan for congressional action on spending 
and revenue legislation. It sets ceilings on total budget 
authority and outlays and a floor on total revenues. It also 
allocates spending authority to the appropriations committees 
and among the various authorizing committees of the House and 
Senate that have jurisdiction over direct spending programs. 
The limits and allocations set by the budget resolution are 
enforced through points of order in the House and Senate.
    The budget reconciliation process is used when changes in 
entitlement or tax law are needed to implement the plan set out 
in the budget resolution. The process begins with the inclusion 
of ``reconciliation instructions'' in the budget resolution. 
These instructions may direct the appropriate authorizing 
committees to report legislation revising programs under their 
jurisdiction to change projected spending by specified amounts. 
They may also direct the tax-writing committees to report 
legislation revising tax law to change revenues by specified 
amounts.
    In response to reconciliation instructions, the various 
committees report their legislative recommendations to the 
Budget Committee. The Budget Committee then assembles the 
legislation into a single omnibus bill--without making any 
substantive revisions--for consideration by the House.
    Prior to the 104th Congress, the Budget Committee did not 
have jurisdiction over legislation other than budget 
resolutions and reconciliation bills. Substantive jurisdiction 
was formally lodged with the Committees on Rules and Government 
Oversight and Reform, although the Budget Committee was 
unofficially responsible for drafting the original Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and amendments 
to both that Act and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
    With the adoption of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives for the 104th Congress (H. Res. 6) on January 
5, 1995, the Budget Committee achieved for the first time 
legislative jurisdiction over major elements of the 
congressional budget process and various statutory controls 
over the Federal budget. The pertinent sections of clause 1(d) 
read as follows:

          (2) * * * other measures setting forth appropriate 
        levels of budget totals for the United States 
        Government.
          (3) Measures relating to the congressional budget 
        process, generally.
          (4) Measures relating to the establishment, 
        extension, and enforcement of special controls over the 
        Federal budget, including the budgetary treatment of 
        off-budget Federal agencies and measures providing 
        exemption form reduction under any order issued under 
        part C of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
        Control Act of 1985.

    The addition to (d)(2) was intended to ensure that the 
Budget Committee have substantive jurisdiction over any 
statement providing for a balanced budget required under the 
proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution amendment. The 
proposed amendment, which passed the House but failed to 
achieve the necessary margin in the Senate, envisioned a 
legislative vehicle other than the concurrent budget resolution 
which would be presented to the President.
    The intent of subparagraph (d)(3) was discussed in a 
memorandum of understanding between Mr. Kasich and Mr. Solomon, 
the chairman of the Committee on Rules. The memorandum states 
that the Budget Committee would have primary jurisdiction over 
budget terminology and the discretionary spending limits. The 
memorandum provided that the Budget Committee was to have 
secondary jurisdiction over such other elements of the 
congressional budget process. Essentially, the Budget Committee 
has primary jurisdiction over both budgetary levels and 
budgetary concepts and secondary jurisdiction over purely 
procedural aspects of the congressional budget process.
    The scope of (d)(3) was elucidated in an agreement between 
Mr. Kasich and Mr. Clinger, the chairman of the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight, and was inserted into the 
Congressional Record by Majority Leader Armey. The agreement 
stipulated that the Budget Committee would have jurisdiction 
over the establishment, extension, and enforcement of mandatory 
and discretionary spending limits, PAYGO requirements, and 
other special budgetary mechanisms to control spending, the 
deficit, or the Federal budgets. Furthermore, jurisdiction over 
the sequestration process would migrate from the Government 
Reform and Oversight Committee to the Budget Committee.
    The agreement also recognized that the Government Reform 
and Oversight Committee would retain, for the duration of the 
104th Congress, jurisdiction over certain budget process 
already in the legislative pipeline, most notably rescission 
authority, performance budgeting, regulatory budgets, and 
capital budgeting.
    In addition to its legislative duties, the Budget Committee 
has responsibilities for oversight and studies. These 
responsibilities include oversight of the Congressional Budget 
Office; study of the outlay effects of existing and proposed 
legislation; study of off-budget entities; study of tax 
expenditures; and study of proposals to improve and facilitate 
the congressional budget process.<SUP>2

                    Activities in the 104th Congress

                         BUDGET PROCESS IN 1995

The contract with America

    In early 1995 the Budget Committee played a central role in 
the consideration of the budgetary components of the Contract 
With America. The centerpiece of the Contract was a $500 per 
child tax credit, a reduction in the capital gains, and other 
tax provisions designed to stimulate economic growth combined 
with an equivalent amount of offsets in mandatory and 
discretionary spending.
    The Budget Committee played a quasi-reconciliation role by 
coordinating the mandatory spending offsets, exercising its 
original jurisdiction to reduce the discretionary spending 
limits, and combining these elements with the tax cuts into a 
single omnibus bill.
    On March 15, 1995, Chairman Kasich introduced H.R. 1219, 
the Discretionary Spending Reduction and Control Act of 1995. 
H.R. 1219 locked in that portion of the spending offsets that 
would come out of discretionary appropriations. The bill 
reduced the discretionary spending limits through fiscal year 
2000 and extended the discretionary spending limits through 
fiscal year 2000. It similarly reduced the limits on the 
Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund over 3 years and extended 
the caps through fiscal year 2000. The bill also modified PAYGO 
requirements if the tax cuts in the Contract were fully offset 
by a combination of entitlement savings and the reduction in 
the discretionary spending limits.
    The committee marked up H.R. 1219 on March 16, 1995. Along 
with the markup document, the chairman provided a list of 
illustrative discretionary spending cuts sufficient to achieve 
the necessary discretionary savings. The committee agreed to an 
amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr. Hobson 
that was identical to the original bill except it incorporated 
the new discretionary spending and Violent Crime Reduction 
Trust Fund limits. The committee also agreed by a voice vote to 
an amendment offered by Mr. Kasich providing a failsafe 
mechanism to ensure the tax cuts would not increase the 
deficit. The committee rejected seven other amendments and one 
was withdrawn. The bill, as amended, was ordered reported that 
same day by a rollcall vote of 24 to 11.
    Mr. Kasich filed the report on H.R. 1219 on March 23, 1995 
(H. Rept. 104-89).
    On March 28, Chairman Kasich introduced H.R. 1327, a bill 
containing the text of the tax provisions ordered reported by 
Ways and Means, a modified version of text of H.R. 1219 ordered 
reported by the Budget Committee, and the text of four separate 
measures which were previously reported or drafted by the 
appropriate authorization committees for the purpose of 
offsetting the balance of the revenue loss from the tax cuts 
with entitlement changes.
    The Rules Committee on April 4 reported House Resolution 
175 (H. Rept. 104-651), a rule making in order the text of H.R. 
1327 as original text for purposes of amendment. The rule also 
self-executed language making the tax reduction contingent on 
deficit reduction and eliminating a tax provision related to 
the privatization of the Uranium Enrichment Corporations. 
Finally, the rule provided for the consideration of a 
substitute to be offered by Mr. Gephardt or his designee.
    H.R. 1215 was considered on April 5, 1995. A substitute 
offered by Mr. Gephardt was defeated 119 to 313. A motion to 
recommit with instructions failed by a vote of 168 to 265. The 
bill passed the House by a margin of 246 to 188 on April 5, 
1995.
    Although the Senate did not directly take up the bill, 
portions of the bill were considered as part of freestanding 
bills and in reconciliation (see reconciliation).

                     FISCAL YEAR 1996 BUDGET CYCLE

Budget resolution

    The regular congressional budget cycle commenced on May 10, 
1995, with the markup of the Fiscal Year 1996 Concurrent 
Resolution on the Budget. Out of eight amendments offered, only 
two were adopted. An amendment offered by Mr. Dogget as amended 
by Mr. Nussle provided report language relating to taking steps 
to avoid the revenue loss from expatriation for tax avoidance. 
The second amendment, which was offered by Mr. Hoekstra, 
provided a sense of the House regarding paying off the Federal 
debt. The resolution was ordered reported with a vote of 24 to 
17.
    Mr. Kasich filed the report accompanying House Concurrent 
Resolution 67, House Report 104-120, on May 15, 1995.
    The Rules Committee reported a rule (H. Res. 149/H. Rept. 
104-125) providing for the consideration of House Concurrent 
Resolution 67 on May 16, 1995. The rule made in order an 
amendment printed in the accompanying report, House Report 104-
125, as original text, provided for 6 hours of general debate, 
made in order four substitutes, and self-executed language 
relating to congressional reconsideration of budget reductions 
in agriculture programs.
    House Resolution 149 was considered on May 16, 1995, and 
passed by a vote of 255 to 168. House Concurrent Resolution 67 
was called up for consideration that same day. Four substitutes 
were defeated by rollcall votes. The House passed the bill, as 
amended by the rule, by 238 to 193.
    The House agreed to a unanimous consent request by Mr. 
Kasich to disagree to the Senate amendment and agree to a 
conference on June 8, 1995. Mr. Sabo offered a motion to 
instruct conferees that was defeated by a vote of 183 to 233.
    The conferees met on June 8, 1995. Senator Domenici was 
nominated chairman of the conference. The conference report was 
filed in the House on June 26 (H. Rept. 104-159). In the rule 
providing for the consideration of the conference report (H. 
Res. 175), the House agreed to the conference report on June 
29.
    On December 18, 1995, Chairman Kasich introduced (by 
request) House Concurrent Resolution 122, a concurrent budget 
resolution for fiscal year 1996. The resolution was based on 
President Clinton's most recent budget submission. While House 
Concurrent Resolution 122 was not reported out of committee, it 
was considered on the floor and failed to pass by a margin of 0 
to 412.

Reconciliation and related events

    The conference report on the budget resolution included 
reconciliation instructions directing 12 authorizing committees 
in the House to submit to the Budget Committee by September 22, 
1995, legislation that would achieve specified revenue and 
mandatory spending levels.
    Some of the committees that were required to submit 
reconciliation instructions did not formally submit this 
legislation since they had reported similar legislation earlier 
in the year that was considered as part of H.R. 1215, the 
Contract With America. Mr. Kasich informed these committees 
that he would incorporate these elements in a substitute that 
would be considered base text when the reconciliation bill was 
considered on the floor.
    On October 12, 1995, the Committee on the Budget ordered 
reported the combined text of the submission from the 
authorizing committees. Pursuant to section 310(b)(2) of the 
Congressional Budget Act, the submissions were not subject to 
amendment. The committee agreed to a motion offered by Mr. 
Hobson to order the bill reported with a favorable 
recommendation by a vote of 24 to 16.
    Following the markup of the reconciliation recommendations, 
the committee marked up the text of H.R. 2459, the Seven-Year 
Balanced Budget Enforcement Act of 1995. The bill reduced the 
discretionary spending and Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund 
limits through fiscal year 1998 and extended these caps, 
together with the PAYGO requirements through fiscal year 2002.
    The committee agreed by voice vote to an amendment in the 
nature of a substitute that was identical to the original bill 
except that it included the actual new levels for the 
discretionary spending limits and the Violent Crime Reduction 
Trust Fund limits. The committee agreed by unanimous consent to 
an amendment offered by Mr. Sabo that would limit the special 
rule for PAYGO scoring of reductions in the discretionary 
spending limits to the 104th Congress. The committee also 
agreed to an amendment by Mr. Shays providing that Medicare 
savings could not be used to offset tax cuts. Two other 
amendments failed and one was ruled out of order as nongermane. 
The committee agreed to report the bill as amended with a 
favorable recommendation by a voice vote.
    Mr. Kasich filed the report on H.R. 2491, House Report 104-
280, on October 17, 1995. He introduced what would ultimately 
be the base text, H.R. 2517, on October 20. H.R. 2517 contained 
the text of both the reconciliation submission reported by the 
Budget Committee, the entitlement and tax provisions previously 
considered as part of H.R. 1215, and a modified version of H.R. 
2459 as ordered reported by the Budget Committee. The Budget 
Committee issued a Committee Print on H.R. 2491 (Serial No. CP-
3). Mr. Kasich did not file a report on H.R. 2459 because it 
would be considered part of H.R. 2491 rather than as a 
freestanding bill.
    The Committee on Rules ordered reported a rule (H. Res. 
245) providing for the consideration of H.R. 2491 on October 
26, 1995. The rule provided for 3 hours of general debate and 
made in order one substitute to be offered by Mr. Gephardt or 
his designee. It made in order the text of H.R. 2517 as 
modified by the amendments printed in the Rules Committee's 
report as original text for purposes of amendment. The 
amendments related to authorizing the export of new drugs if 
approved in recipient country, new tools for agencies to 
collect debt owed to the United States, civil monetary 
penalties, the collection of parking fees, the National 
Technology Service Institute, changing the Medicaid allotment, 
and lowering the discretionary spending limits.
    House Resolution 245 passed the House by a vote of 228 to 
191 on October 26. The House rejected an amendment offered by 
Mr. Orton by a vote of 72 to 356. The House rejected by a vote 
of 180 to 250 a motion by Mr. Gephardt to recommit the bill to 
the Budget Committee with instructions to report the bill back 
to the House with various modifications. The House then passed 
the reconciliation bill by 227 to 203.
    The House agreed to a motion offered by Mr. Kasich to 
disagree to the Senate amendment and ask for a conference on 
October 30, 1995. Mr. Sabo offered a motion to instruct 
conferees that was defeated by 198 to 219.
    The conferees met on November 14, 1995. Representative 
Kasich nominated Senator Domenici as the chairman of the 
conference. The House provisions taken from H.R. 2459 were not 
included in the conference report because they would have been 
subject to the Byrd rule in the Senate as extraneous to the 
reconciliation bill. The conference report was filed on 
November 16 (H. Rept. 104-347). House Resolution 272 vacated 
the initial report because of the inadvertent omission of a 
provision relating to clinical labs under Medicare. The 
corrected conference report was filed the same day (H. Rept. 
104-350). The House agreed to the conference report on November 
17 by a vote of 237 to 189. The Senate sustained a point of 
order under the Byrd rule, thereby striking provisions relating 
to the exemption of physician office laboratories and the 
application of antitrust rules to provider-sponsored 
organizations. The Senate then receded from its amendment and 
concurred with an amendment omitting the two provisions. The 
House agreed to the Senate amendment on November 20.
    The President vetoed H.R. 2491 on December 6, 1995.
    Also on November 20, the House passed and the President 
signed a continuing resolution, House Joint Resolution 132, 
committing the Congress and administration to enact a plan to 
balance the budget by fiscal year 2002 ``as estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office.''

                     fiscal year 1997 budget cycle

Budget resolution

    The committee marked up the concurrent resolution on the 
budget for fiscal year 1997 on May 9, 1996. The committee 
passed a sense-of-Congress amendment relating to the impact of 
reconciliation on children offered by Mrs. Mink; a sense-of-
Congress amendment offered by Ms. Roybal-Allard relating to 
domestic violence and Federal assistance; an amendment offered 
by Ms. Rivers relating to the Coastal Management Act; and a 
sense-of-Congress amendment offered by Mr. Shays relating to 
Medicaid. The committee defeated 12 other amendments and 1 was 
withdrawn. The committee agreed to the budget resolution, as 
amended, by a rollcall vote of 23 to 18.
    The Committee on Rules ordered reported (H. Res. 435/H. 
Rept. 104-570) a rule providing for the consideration of House 
Concurrent Resolution 178 on May 15, 1996. The rule made in 
order three substitutes to be offered by Representatives 
Gephardt, Orton, and Sabo. The rule further provided that the 
allocations in the resolution would serve as the effective 
allocations for purposes of enforcing section 603 of the Budget 
Act until the conference report was agreed to. Finally, the 
rule provided for the suspension of House rule XLIX which 
provides for an automatic engrossment of legislation raising

Transportation trust funds

    On February 7, 1995, Representative Shuster, chairman of 
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, introduced 
H.R. 842. H.R. 842 would have removed all the transportation 
trust funds from Federal budgetary controls. Its purpose is to 
increase transportation spending by exempting the 
transportation trust funds from budget disciplines including 
the discretionary spending limits and PAYGO rules.
    The Transportation and Public Works Committee ordered the 
bill reported on May 5, 1995, but did not actually file the 
report until March 27, 1996 (H. Rept. 104-499).

ordered the bill reported with the recommendation that it not

for the consideration of the bill on March 29, 1996 (H. Res. 
396/H. Rept. 104-514). The rule provided for one hour of 
general debate and did not restrict amendments.
    House Resolution 396 passed by a voice vote. The bill was 
considered that same day. The House agreed to a committee 
substitute, an amendment subjecting the trust fund to 
provisions of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, and an amendment 
by Representative Oberstar limiting interest credited to 
transportation trust funds to the average rate on 52-week 
Treasury securities sold to the public. Three other amendments 
were defeated and one was withdrawn. The bill, as amended, 
passed by 284 to 143.

            Summary of Oversight Plan for the 104th Congress

    The following is a summary of the Oversight Plan submitted 
by the Committee on the Budget for the 104th Congress:
    To fulfill its obligation to the American people, the House 
Committee on the Budget, which has been given the 
responsibility by the House of Representatives to oversee the 
federal budget and the process by which the budget is adopted, 
has an aggressive oversight plan for the historic 104th 
Congress.
          To fulfill its responsibility to develop an annual 
        concurrent budget resolution, the Committee will hold 
        hearings and receive testimony from Members of 
        Congress, cabinet-level officials, state and local 
        officials, and expert witnesses to review the federal 
        budget in general, as well as the budgets and spending 
        histories of specific Departments. The Committee also 
        will hold a series of field hearings to receive 
        testimony from the general public on innovative ways to 
        reduce and control the federal budget.
          The Committee will review the activities of the 
        Congressional Budget Office. During 1995 the Committee 
        also will recommend to the Speaker who to appoint as 
        the new Director of the Congressional Budget Office.
          The Committee will study proposals designed to 
        improve the congressional budget process.
          The Committee will coordinate its oversight 
        activities with other Committees, including, but not 
        limited to, considering other Committee's Views and 
        Estimates when developing the annual concurrent budget 
        resolution.
          The Committee will study provisions of law which 
        exempt federal agencies or any of their activities or 
        outlays from inclusion in the Budget of the United 
        States Government, and make recommendations for 
        terminating or modifying such provisions.
          The Committee will study the effect of existing and 
        proposed legislation, as well as government regulation, 
        on government spending.
          The Committee will request and evaluate continuing 
        studies of tax expenditures, and ways to improve 
        coordination between tax incentives and direct 
        spending.
          The Committee will study monetary policy and its 
        effect on the federal budget.

      Summary of Oversight Actions Taken During the 104th Congress

    The following is a summary of the major oversight actions 
taken by the House Budget Committee during the 104th Congress:
          During the course of developing the annual concurrent 
        budget resolutions for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the 
        Committee held numerous hearings at which testimony was 
        received from members of the President's cabinet and 
        other administration officials regarding the budgets 
        and spending histories of the federal government and 
        specific departments and agencies. (A complete list of 
        Committee hearings held during the 104th Congress is 
        included in this report.)
          The Committee engaged in its statutory obligation to 
        oversee the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) by: (1) 
        its recommendation to the Speaker on who to appoint as 
        Director of CBO; (2) receiving testimony from the 
        Director and other staff of CBO during Committee 
        hearings; and (3) its daily interaction with CBO to 
        insure that CBO fulfill its mandate to provide Congress 
        with budget information, data, estimates, statistics, 
        etc.
          The Committee studied proposals designed to improve 
        the congressional budget process. As part of its 
        review, the Committee held a series of three hearings 
        devoted to the congressional budget process, at which 
        testimony was received from experts from CBO and the 
        General Accounting Office (GAO), outside experts, as 
        well as interested Members of Congress.
          The Committee coordinated its oversight activities 
        with other House committees in formulating the annual 
        concurrent budget resolutions, including soliciting and 
        considering the other committees' Views and Estimates.
          The Committee studied the effect of existing and 
        proposed legislation, as well as government regulation 
        on government spending. Significant staff resources 
        were devoted to this activity, in addition to 
        substantial utilization of GAO resources and services. 
        (A complete list of GAO reports issued at the request 
        of the Budget Committee is included in this report.)
          The Committee studied monetary policy and its effect 
        on the federal budget. As part of its review, the 
        Committee held two hearings at which it received 
        testimony from Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal 
        Reserve.
