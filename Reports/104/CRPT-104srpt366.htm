  ``Sec. 213. Effective January 1, 1997, the Institute shall 
provide semiannual reports to the Committees on the Judiciary 
of the Senate and the House of Representatives identifying all 
grants made by the Institute during the preceding six months. 
The report shall include the name and address of the grantee, 
the purpose of the project, the amount of funding provided, and 
the duration of the project.''.

                               I. Purpose

    The committee believes that S. 1887 will substantially 
improve the efficiency and fairness of Federal court 
operations. In large part, the bill is based on recommendations 
received from the Judicial Conference of the United States 
which is the governing body of the Federal judiciary. The 
Judicial Conference, through a variety of committees 
established by the Conference, continually monitors and 
evaluates court operations. In addition, several provisions of 
the bill incorporate recommendations of the Federal Courts 
Study Committee which Congress created to analyze the courts of 
the United States and develop a long-term plan for the judicial 
system.
    A primary purpose of S. 1887 is to remedy inefficiencies 
and, thereby, to reduce judiciary operating costs. The bill 
makes a variety of improvements in procedures and 
administration with an emphasis on court operations, the 
magistrate judges system, the bankruptcy system, and judiciary 
personnel administration. In addition, the bill will achieve 
immediate cost savings that will benefit both the Federal 
judiciary and the Federal treasury.

                        II. Legislative History

    Contained in S. 1887 are several proposals carried over 
from previous Congresses, as well as a number of new proposals 
supported by the Judicial Conference. This bill was originally 
introduced by Senators Hatch and Heflin on August 1, 1995, as 
S. 1101 at the request of the Judicial Conference.
    The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative 
Oversight and the Courts held a hearing on S. 1101 on October 
24, 1995. Testifying before the subcommittee were the Honorable 
Barefoot Sanders, chairman of the Committee on the Judicial 
Branch; the Honorable Gustave Diamond, U.S. District Court; the 
Honorable Stephen H. Anderson, Committee on Federal-State 
Jurisdiction; the Honorable W. Earl Britt, president, Federal 
Judges Association; John J. Curtin, Jr., American Bar 
Association; Robert L. Fanter, vice president, Defense Research 
Institute; and Loren E. Weiss, National Association of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers.
    Following the hearing, the subcommittee conducted a lengthy 
process to improve the bill and to reach a consensus that was 
agreeable to subcommittee and committee members. Consequently, 
most of the contentious provisions of the bill were eliminated 
through this process of creating a bipartisan modification of 
the bill.
    This modification to S. 1101 was reintroduced by Senators 
Grassley, Hatch, and Heflin as S. 1887, the Federal Court 
Improvements Act of 1996. The bill was amended in subcommittee 
to include reauthorization of the State Justice Institute. On 
July 19, 1996, S. 1887 was polled out of the subcommittee to 
the full committee by a vote of 6 to 0, with one abstention. On 
July 25, 1996, the Judiciary Committee considered S. 1887 and 
reported the bill to the Senate by unanimous consent after 
adopting three amendments.

                      III. Votes of the Committee

    The Senate Judiciary Committee, with a quorum present, met 
on Thursday, July 25, 1996, at 10 a.m. to mark up S. 1887. The 
following rollcall votes occurred on the bill and amendments 
proposed thereto:
    (1) The Thurmond amendment prohibits an award of costs and 
attorney's fees against a judge for actions taken in a judicial 
capacity, unless an action is clearly in excess of the judge's 
jurisdiction.
    The amendment was approved by a roll call vote of 14 yeas 
and 4 nays.

under regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference.
    The amendment was approved by unanimous consent.
    (3) The Kohl amendment allows the disclosure of information 
obtained through discovery or an order restricting access to 
court records in a civil case unless a court makes 
particularized findings of fact to the contrary.
    The amendment was approved by a rollcall vote of 11 yeas 
and 7 nays.

                    IV. Section-by-Section Analysis

         title i--criminal law and criminal justice amendments

Sec. 101.--New Authority for probation and pretrial services officers

    This section provides Federal authority for probation and 
pretrial services officers to carry firearms under rules 
prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts, if approved by the appropriate district 
court.
    Probation and pretrial services officers may presently 
carry weapons under circumstances specified by the Judicial 
Conference only if State law permits. In some jurisdictions, 
State law prohibits or limits these officers from carrying 
weapons, even where the officer has Federal court approval to 
do so. In those States, the personal security of these officers 
is being compromised. Without a Federal statute authorizing 
officers to carry firearms, these officers can encounter legal 
problems in crossing state lines while performing their duties. 
For example, when an officer is working in the community 
supervising offenders near a State border, the officer's State 
authorization to carry firearms may not be legal if the officer 
should cross a state border while conducting normal supervision 
activities. An offender may have a nearby job in an adjacent 
State and the officer must travel to the job site to verify the 
employment.
    Congress has addressed and remedied this problem for the 
employees of other Federal Government agencies involved in the 
criminal justice system, e.g., Bureau of Prisons, 18 U.S.C. 
3050; Drug Enforcement Administration, 21 U.S.C. 878; 
Environmental Protection Agency, 18 U.S.C. 3063; Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, 18 U.S.C. 3052; Postal Service, 18 U.S.C. 
3061; Secret Service, 18 U.S.C. 3056; U.S. Marshals Service, 18 
U.S.C. 3053. This section provides identical legal treatment 
for Federal probation and pretrial officers.

Sec. 102.--Tort Claims Act amendments relating to liability of Federal 
        public defenders

    In Ferri v. Ackerman, 444 U.S. 193 (1979), the Supreme 
Court held that public defenders were not immune from 
malpractice actions. After considering whether to ask Congress 
to amend the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 2671 et 
seq., to bring Federal public defenders within its coverage, 
the Judicial Conference instead proposed amending the Criminal 
Justice Act to provide malpractice coverage. Such authority was 
added by the Criminal Justice Act Revision of 1986 and is 
currently set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3006A(g)(3). That provision 
authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts to ``provide representation for and hold 
harmless, or provide liability insurance for'' Federal 
defenders ``for money damages for injury, loss of liberty, loss 
of property, or personal injury or death arising from 
malpractice or negligence * * * in furnishing representational 
services * * * while acting within the scope of that person's 
office or employment.''
    In 1991, the Supreme Court in United States v. Smith, 499 
U.S. 160 (1991), held that the FTCA is the sole vehicle for 
pursuing common law torts against Federal Government employees. 
Following that decision, the seventh circuit held that a 
Federal public defender is an ``employee of the government'' 
for purposes of the FTCA, and the exclusive remedy for alleged 
malpractice would be an action against the United States under 
the FTCA. Sullivan v. U.S., 21 F.3d 198 (7th Cir. 1994).
    The amendment made by this section exempts Federal public 
defender organization officers and employees from the FTCA for 
claims related to representational services and relies instead 
on the malpractice provision of 18 U.S.C. 3006A(g)(3) 
specifically enacted in 1986 to deal with such claims. This 
simplifies the provision of representation to Federal public 
defender employees and avoids creating unnecessary conflicts of 
interest for the United States attorney and the Federal public 
defender.

                title ii--judicial process improvements

Sec. 201.--Duties of magistrate judge on emergency assignment

    This section authorizes magistrate judges temporarily 
assigned to another judicial district because of an emergency 
to dispose of civil cases with the consent of the parties. 
Magistrate judges sitting in their own districts already 
possess this authority. Magistrate judges serving on emergency 
assignment, therefore, would have the same authority as those 
serving in regular status.
    Section 636(f) of title 28 permits the temporary assignment 
of a magistrate judge from one judicial district to another in 
emergency situations upon the concurrence of the chief judges 
of the districts involved. The magistrate judge may perform 
duties specified in section 636 (a) and (b). Subsection (f) was 
added to the Federal Magistrates Act in 1972. The civil consent 
provisions in section 636(c) were enacted in 1979, subsequent 
to the enactment of the emergency provisions. It would appear 
that through oversight no corresponding subsection (f) 
amendment was made in 1979 to permit magistrate judges on 
emergency assignment in another district to enter judgment in 
civil cases upon the consent of the parties. Accordingly, this 
section corrects that oversight.

Sec. 202.--Consent to trial in certain criminal actions

    Under 18 U.S.C. 3401(b), U.S. magistrate judges may not try 
a misdemeanor or petty offense case unless the defendant files 
a written consent to be tried before a magistrate judge and 
specifically waives in writing the right to be tried by an 
article III judge. Before the defendant files such consent, the 
magistrate judge must ``carefully explain'' to the defendant 
that he or she has a right to trial before an article III 
judge. This section removes this restriction in petty offense 
cases, thereby authorizing magistrate judges to try petty 
offense cases without the consent of the defendants. The 
section also authorizes magistrate judges to try class A 
misdemeanor cases upon either written consent or oral consent 
of the defendant on the record.

             Elimination of consent in petty offense cases

    Section 19 of title 18, United States Code, defines a petty 
offense as a class B misdemeanor, a class C misdemeanor, or an 
infraction for which the maximum term of incarceration is 6 
months and the maximum fine is $5,000 for an individual. In 
large part, petty offense cases heard in Federal courts involve 
traffic violations or other violations of regulations governing 
Federal enclaves, including national parks and military bases.
    This section eliminates the option a defendant currently 
has in a proceeding before a magistrate judge to insist on 
article III court disposition of a petty offense. This 
amendment provides an efficient, professional forum for dealing 
with misconduct of a minor nature, most often occurring on 
Federal enclaves and typically remote from article III 
facilities. Most defendants routinely consent to proceeding 
before a magistrate judge.
    However, some defendants purposely decline to consent to a 
trial before a magistrate judge, expecting the prosecution to 
drop the charges rather than incur the expense and 
inconvenience of trial before an article III judge when 
compared to the seriousness of the misconduct. Other defendants 
decline to consent for a variety of different reasons, often 
with a similar result.
    An additional benefit of this section is the elimination of 
the necessity of a complicated procedure on the record for 
obtaining an ``informed consent to proceed'' from each 
defendant. This section, therefore, enhances the efficiency of 
the courts and eliminates abusive manipulation of the system by 
some defendants.
    The committee believes the Federal magistrate judge system 
is mature and well equipped to provide a fair and effective 
means for processing petty offense cases without resort to an 
article III judge. The Judicial Conference has repeatedly 
recognized this capability by endorsing the elimination of 
consent in petty offense cases. In 1979, the Conference favored 
the elimination of consent in petty offense cases during the 
congressional debate over the 1979 amendments to the Federal 
Magistrates Act. In 1981, the Judicial Conference restated its 
support for eliminating consent in ``The Federal Magistrates 
System, Report to the Congress by the Judicial Conference of 
the United States.'' In September 1991, the Judicial Conference 
again endorsed the provision in proposed housekeeping 
legislation that would eliminate a defendant's consent to trial 
by a magistrate judge in petty offense cases.
    Some have argued that a constitutional issue may arise 
because petty offenses require adjudication by an article III 
judge. However, there is no constitutional right to 
adjudication of a petty offense case before an article III 
judge. Palmore v. United States, 411 U.S. 389, 400-403 (1973). 
In addition, there is a longstanding tradition of such matters 
being tried by judicial officers other than article III judges. 
(Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate Judges 
System of the Judicial Conference of the United States, 
December 1, 1995). Moreover, at the time the Constitution was 
ratified, petty offense cases were handled routinely by 
justices of the peace and other lower level judicial officers 
in Britain and in the newly formed States of the United States. 
Doub & Kestenbaum, ``Federal Magistrates for the Trial of Petty 
Offenses: Need and Constitutionality,'' 107 U. Pa. Law Rev. 443 
(1959).

               Oral consent in class A misdemeanor cases

    There is no legal significance between written consent and 
consent made orally on the record, provided that the 
defendant's consent is made with full knowledge of the 
consequences of such consent, is intelligently given, and is 
voluntary. This section preserves such knowing and voluntary 
consent. However, the execution of written consent by each 
class A misdemeanor defendant often unnecessarily prolongs the 
time needed to hear each case. The elimination of the written 
consent requirement saves time and eases burdensome paperwork 
for the magistrate judges and other district court personnel.
    Many of the concerns that led Congress to enact the written 
consent provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3401 in 1979 have receded. 
Congress demonstrated that it is comfortable with the quality 
and competence of magistrate judges and less concerned about 
coerced consent when it relaxed the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 
636(c) governing litigant consent to civil trials by magistrate 
judges in 1990. Similar reasoning is also applicable to 
misdemeanor consent provisions. The new section thus preserves 
the misdemeanor defendant's right to choose adjudication of a 
case by an article III judge while also improving judicial 
efficiency.
    The other changes made by this section bring other statutes 
into conformity with the effects of section 202(a) discussed 
above.

Sec. 203.--Venue in civil actions

    The Judicial Conference considered a recommendation to 
repeal 28 U.S.C. 1392(a), providing that ``Any civil action, 
not of a local nature, against defendants residing in different 
districts in the same State, may be brought in any of such 
districts.'' Based on recent amendments to subsections 1391 
(a)(1) and (b)(1), the Judicial Conference concluded that 
subsection 1392(a) is redundant and should be repealed. This 
section eliminates subsection 1392(a) of title 28, United 
States Code.

Sec. 204.--Registration of judgments for enforcement in other districts

    This section clarifies that in 28 U.S.C. 1963, a judgment 
in an action for recovery of money or property that was entered 
in a court of appeals or a bankruptcy court may also be 
registered for enforcement purposes in any district. Such 
judgments of a district court are currently covered by this 
statute. As a practical matter, bankruptcy courts, as adjuncts 
to the district courts, have been relatively unaffected by the 
present law specifying the district court. However, this change 
is necessary to clarify the statute as to bankruptcy courts and 
to enable courts of appeal judgments to be registered for 
enforcement in other districts. This need arises at the 
appellate level especially in the enforcement of administrative 
law orders which have been appealed to the courts of appeal, 
but are to be enforced at the district level.

Sec. 205.--Vacancy in clerk position; absence of clerk

    While it might be thought self-evident that deputy clerks 
may act for the clerk of court whenever the clerk is unable to 
perform official duties for any reason, the current language of 
28 U.S.C. 954 speaks only to deputy clerks acting in lieu of a 
deceased clerk. This section amends section 954 to clarify that 
deputy clerks may act whenever the clerk cannot perform his or 
her official duties. It also permits the court to designate an 
acting clerk of court, when it is expected that the clerk will 
be unavailable or the office of clerk will be vacant for a 
prolonged period. This section also deletes an obsolete 
provision in section 954 relating to the compensation of a 
deceased clerk of the Supreme Court. A conforming amendment 
changes the chapter's table of contents.

Sec. 206.--Diversity jurisdiction

    This section amends 28 U.S.C. 1332, relating to diversity 
jurisdiction to raise the jurisdictional amount from $50,000 to 
$75,000. The Judicial Conference requested that Congress not 
only increase the threshold amount, but also index it to 
inflation and eliminate the in-state plaintiff in diversity 
jurisdiction cases.
    The committee recognizes the importance of balancing the 
need to assist the Federal judiciary in reducing its increasing 
caseload with the needs of those making use of our Federal 
courts. The committee determined the most reasonable 
modification, at this time, is to raise the jurisdictional 
amount, but not index it, and to leave the in-state plaintiff 
as it is.
    The adjustment of the jurisdictional amount provides claims 
with substantial amounts at issue access to a Federal forum, if 
diversity of citizenship among the parties exists. The most 
recent change in the jurisdictional amount became effective in 
May 1989 pursuant to the Judicial Improvements and Access to 
Justice Act (Public Law No. 100-702), which increased the 
amount from $10,000 to $50,000.

Sec. 207.--Bankruptcy administrator program

    This section provides statutory authority for bankruptcy 
administrators in Alabama and North Carolina to appoint 
bankruptcy case trustees, standing trustees, examiners, and 
committees of creditors and equity security holders, as is done 
in the rest of the country by U.S. trustees. Bankruptcy 
administrators also are given authority to fix standing 
trustee's maximum annual compensation and percentage fee. 
Because subtitle A of title II of the Bankruptcy Judges, United 
States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 
(Public Law 99-554; 28 U.S.C. 581 note) is not effective in the 
judicial districts in Alabama and North Carolina, this section 
amends the former provisions of the Bankruptcy Code which are 
in effect in those States.
    Experience with the bankruptcy administrator program has 
shown that it is desirable to have bankruptcy administrators 
make these appointments and fix standing trustees' compensation 
and percentage fee. Acting pursuant to regulations adopted by 
the Judicial Conference of the United States and guidelines 
promulgated by the Director of the Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts, bankruptcy administrators currently make 
recommendations to the court on these matters.
    Authorizing bankruptcy administrators to make these 
appointments and fix standing trustees' compensation and 
percentage fee directly also furthers one of the central goals 
of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Public Law 95-598, 
freeing bankruptcy judges from an administrative role in their 
cases. Although the 1986 act authorized U.S. trustees to 
perform these functions, it did not specifically authorize 
bankruptcy administrators to do so, even though the two 
officials have similar roles in overseeing the administration 
of estates and supervising trustees and other fiduciaries in 
bankruptcy cases.
    This section also authorizes bankruptcy administrators to 
serve as trustees in bankruptcy cases, when necessary. 
Bankruptcy administrators would be granted the same authority 
to serve as trustees in chapter 7 cases as U.S. trustees, that 
is, when none of the members of the panel of private trustees 
is disinterested and willing to serve in the case. Like U.S. 
trustees, bankruptcy administrators could serve as case 
trustees in chapter 12 and chapter 13 cases and, like assistant 
U.S. trustees, as standing trustees. Assistant U.S. trustees 
are authorized to serve as standing trustees because of 
differences in the way the program is structured.

Sec. 208.--Removal of cases against the United States and Federal 
        officers or agencies

    This section allows civil actions and criminal prosecutions 
against Federal agencies as well as those against Federal 
officers sued in either an individual or official capacity to 
be removed to Federal district court. A Federal forum in such 
cases is important since state court actions against Federal 
agencies and officers often involve complex Federal issues and 
Federal-State conflicts. This bill legislatively reverses the 
Supreme Court's decision in International Primate Protection 
League, et al. v. Administrators of Tulane Educational Fund, et 
al., 111 S.Ct. 1700 (1991), which held that only Federal 
officers, not Federal agencies, may remove State court actions 
to Federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1442(a)(1).
    This section fulfills Congress' intent that questions 
concerning the exercise of Federal authority, the scope of 
Federal immunity and Federal-State conflicts be adjudicated in 
Federal court. It also clarifies that suits against Federal 
agencies, as well as those against Federal officers sued in 
either an individual or official capacity, may be removed to 
Federal district court. This section does not alter the 
requirement that a Federal law defense be alleged for a suit to 
be removable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1442(a)(1).

Sec. 209.--Appeal route in civil cases decided by magistrate judges 
        with consent

    In cases where parties to a civil action have consented to 
case-dispositive authority of a magistrate judge, current law 
permits an appeal of the judgment directly to the court of 
appeals or, as an alternative and if the parties agree, to a 
district judge followed by discretionary review in the court of 
appeals.
    This section eliminates the alternative route of appeal to 
the district judge, as recommended in the Judicial Conference's 
Long Range Plan for the Federal Courts. Although intended as a 
less expensive means of obtaining appellate review, this 
alternative appeal route is inconsistent with the principle 
underlying the ``consent'' authority of magistrate judges--that 
the parties agree to disposition of their case without 
involving a district judge. A single forum of appeal in civil 
consent cases simplifies court procedures and recognizes the 
existing practice in most districts.

Sec. 210.--Reports by judicial councils relating to misconduct and 
        disability orders

    This section requires each Judicial Council to submit an 
annual report to the Administrative Office of the United States 
Courts on the number and nature of orders relating to judicial 
misconduct or disability under 28 U.S.C. 332. This reporting 
requirement was recommended by the Report of the National 
Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal (August 1993), 
which found that reliable information concerning Council orders 
was difficult to obtain.

Sec. 211.--Protective orders; sealing of cases; disclosure of 
        information

    This section requires that before a judge can enter an 
order restricting the disclosure of information under rule 26 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure the judge must consider 
the impact of the order on public health and safety. In cases 
where the information is relevant to the protection of public 
health and safety, the judge must determine that the need for 
confidentiality clearly outweighs the public interest in 
disclosure. The judge must also determine that the protective 
order is no broader than necessary to protect the asserted 
privacy interest.
    In addition, this provision invalidates, as contrary to 
public policy, all agreements that prohibit a party from 
disclosing information to a Federal or State agency with 
authority to regulate activity related to the information.

title iii--judiciary personnel administration, benefits and protections

Sec. 301.--Senior judge certification

    This section revises the senior judge work certification 
procedures set forth in 28 U.S.C. 371(f). Currently, retired 
justices and senior judges are required to be certified every 
year in order to receive subsequent salary increases (other 
than cost-of-living increases). If a justice or judge is not 
certified in any year, 28 U.S.C. 371(f)(3) provides that he or 
she is thereafter ineligible to be certified and to receive a 
subsequent salary increase.
    Subsection 301(a) allows for retroactive certification if a 
judge resumes a significant workload. This subsection revises 
28 U.S.C. 371(f)(3) by providing that judges who are not 
certified in one year may perform work in a subsequent year and 
then attribute the subsequent work to the earlier year in order 
to satisfy the certification requirement for the earlier year. 
It further provides that senior judges may not receive credit 
for the same work for more than 1 year.

Sec. 302.--Refund of contribution for deceased deferred annuitant under 
        the judicial survivors' annuities system

    This section is a technical amendment to 28 U.S.C. 
376(o)(1) addressing a contingency not addressed under the 
current statute relating to officials who retire on deferred 
annuities. The question arises, for example, if a judicial 
official retires on a deferred annuity and agrees to continue 
Judicial Survivors' Annuities System (JSAS) contribution during 
the period between leaving office and commencement of the 
annuity, but either dies before making the requisite 18 months 
of contributions for vesting purposes (a possibility for 
individuals who join JSAS during an ``open season'' and retire 
shortly thereafter) or dies without eligible survivors. Under 
the current statute, in cases where a judicial official dies 
without eligible survivors or before his or her JSAS benefits 
have vested, a lump-sum payment of contributions, with 
interest, is made to designated beneficiaries if the judicial 
official ``dies while in office, or while receiving `retirement 
pay'.'' This amendment applies the same policy to a judicial 
official who dies between the time of retirement and 
commencement of annuity payments.

Sec. 303.--Judicial administrative officials retirement matters

    This section provides a greater degree of equity and parity 
in crediting prior Federal service for purposes of retirement 
by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United 
States Courts, the Director of the Federal Judicial Center, and 
the Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice of the United 
States. These officials currently may receive a maximum of 5 
years of retirement credit for prior service in any civilian 
Presidential appointment in the executive branch requiring 
Senate confirmation, but they may receive credit for prior 
service in the legislative branch only as a Member of Congress.
    This section allows credit for prior legislative branch 
service of a comparable rank and responsibility to the 
executive branch service that is currently creditable. Credit 
would be allowed to a primary administrative assistant to a 
Member of Congress or as staff director or chief counsel for a 
committee or subcommittee. Although this section limits 
congressional service credit to high-level positions, it 
further requires that the person serving in the position have 
served in that capacity for at least 5 years or at a salary 
that is within the top 10 percent of salaries for congressional 
staff at the time of the service. The other changes to 28 
U.S.C. 611 and 627 are clarifying and conforming amendments.

Sec. 304.--Bankruptcy judges reappointment procedure

     This section amends the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal 
Judgeship Act of 1984, Public Law No. 98-353, 120, as amended 
by Public Law No. 99-554, 102, 100 Stat. 3089, to authorize the 
Judicial Conference to prescribe regulations which provide for 
the reappointment of incumbent bankruptcy judges that differ 
from the initial appointment of bankruptcy judges.
    The Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 
articulated strict, specifically detailed ethical and 
scholastic standards for the selection of U.S. bankruptcy 
judges to ensure that such selections are governed by merit, 
character, and scholastic ability. This act also requires the 
judicial council for each circuit, or a merit selection panel, 
if so convened by the council, to screen and review the 
qualifications of applicants, using strict criteria specific 
both by the act and by accompanying regulations issued by the 
Judicial Conference of the United States. These procedures are 
thorough and time-consuming, both for the applicants and the 
reviewers. These procedures are unnecessary, however, in the 
case of applicants who are incumbent bankruptcy judges. The 
information regarding an incumbent's merit, scholarship, 
judicial temperament, etc., is no longer a matter which a 
judicial council or a merit selection screening panel need 
attempt to ascertain; they are facts, amply supported by a 14-
year-old record. Thus, this section simply eliminates 
unnecessary expenditures of time and money.

Sec. 305.--Carrying of firearms

    This section authorizes Federal judges, including 
magistrate judges and bankruptcy judges, to carry firearms for 
purposes of personal security under regulations prescribed by 
the Judicial Conference. Although the United States Marshals 
Service already provides protection for judges upon specific 
threats, judges need authority to protect themselves against 
unidentified dangers.
    The need for preemptive Federal legislation is pointed out 
by the fact that judges carrying firearms when crossing 
municipal or state boundaries on a daily or frequent basis may 
be violating local laws. A Federal Statute preempting State law 
as to Federal judges is needed in that eight States and the 
District of Columbia currently prohibit non-exempt citizens 
from carrying firearms.
    The Department of Justice, which supports the goals of this 
section, raised a number of concerns with the original language 
as reported out of subcommittee. At full committee, Senator 
Heflin offered an amendment, which addressed most of those 
concerns, and the committee adopted the amendment unanimously.
    The amendment deleted language from the bill that granted 
judges immunity from suit with regard to the use of such 
firearms; the amendment added language to strengthen the bill's 
requirement that judges demonstrate proficiency in the use, 
safety and maintenance of firearms; language was added 
directing the Department of Justice to cooperate with the 
Judicial Conference, upon request, with respect to such 
training; and the amendment made it clear that judges are not 
authorized to carry firearms aboard aircraft or other common 
carriers.
    The section also allows for a delay in the effective date 
of the provision in order to allow the Judicial Conference to 
establish and promulgate regulations on the carrying of 
firearms by Federal judicial officers. These regulations will 
address training and weapons qualifications requirements.

Sec. 306.--Technical correction related to commencement date of 
        temporary judgeships

    When the Federal Judgeship Act was passed in 1990, it 
created, among other things, both permanent judgeships and a 
temporary judgeship in two district courts, the Eastern 
District of Missouri and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
This section eliminates potential confusion about the date on 
which the temporary judgeship will lapse. When these judgeship 
positions have been filled, the source of the position has been 
identified as the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 without 
specifying whether the position being filled is the permanent 
or the temporary position.
    The amended language of the 1990 act creating temporary 
judgeships specifies that the first vacancy occurring 5 years 
after the confirmation of the judge appointed to fill the 
position shall not be filled. Without more specificity on which 
of the judgeships is the temporary position, uncertainty exists 
as to the date on when the position will lapse.
    This section eliminates that confusion by specifying that 
the last of the judgeships (created by this act in these two 
districts) filled shall be the temporary position. In this 
manner, the legislation will more fully comport with the intent 
of the temporary judgeship positions by assuring that the 
courts have the benefit of those temporary judgeships for at 
least the 5-year period specified in the act.

Sec. 307.--Full-time status of court reporters

    This section corrects an inequity caused by the unique 
nature of court reporter work that unjustly penalizes court 
reporters at retirement. Sections 8339(o) and 8415(e) of title 
5 were added in 1986 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
of 1985 to eliminate the availability of windfall retirement 
annuities for part-time employees. The Office of Personnel 
Management has issued a formal opinion which could deprive 
court reporters who are not on a regularly scheduled 40 hour 
weekly tour of duty in the courthouse of a full retirement 
annuity, irrespective of receipt of a full-time salary and 
concomitant full retirement contributions. Under this opinion, 
court reporters who wish to receive a retirement annuity based 
upon ``full-time'' service (as opposed to part-time service and 
a resulting reduction in annuity) must either (a) work a 
scheduled tour of duty in the courthouse of 80 hours per pay 
period; or (b) maintain records of the actual hours worked on 
Federal business and work a minimum of 2080 hours per year on 
that business. However, court reporters work irregular hours 
and may not work the entire 40 hours in the courthouse. This 
section remedies this by providing that court reporters who are 
paid a full-time salary will be treated like full-time 
employees for retirement purposes.
    In order that annuities not be reduced solely due to the 
lack of a regularly scheduled tour of duty if the reporter is 
paid a full salary as fixed by the Judicial Conference, the 
Conference in September 1988 recommended the proposed 
legislative change to define court reporters as ``full-time'' 
employees for annuity purposes if they are paid full-time 
salaries.

Sec. 308.--Court interpreters

    This section cures what was an unanticipated statutory 
restriction on the Federal courts' ability to respond to the 
needs of hearing-impaired persons participating in court 
proceedings. The Court Interpreters Act at 28 U.S.C. 1827 
(d)(1) and (e)(2) authorizes the provision of paid interpreting 
services to the hearing-impaired (as well as to non-English 
speakers), but only to parties and witnesses and only in 
criminal cases or civil actions instituted by the United 
States. At 28 U.S.C. 1827(g)(4) and 1828(b) (with regard to 
special interpretation services), the act provides that such 
services may be provided in other proceedings with the approval 
of the presiding judicial officer, but only on a cost-
reimbursable basis.
    Especially in recent years, since the enactment of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, hearing-impaired persons in a 
variety of circumstances, such as debtors in bankruptcy cases, 
parties in private civil cases, attorneys representing private 
clients, and others, have requested Federal courts to provide 
them with sign language interpreters so that they may 
meaningfully participate in court proceedings. No matter how 
sympathetic a presiding judge may be to such requests, however, 
because of the restriction in the Court Interpreters Act, the 
courts have been limited to providing this service on a 
reimbursable basis.
    This section promotes accommodation to this class of 
disabled persons by vesting judicial officers with the 
discretion to provide sign language interpreters at court 
expense, subject to the availability of funds, to any 
participant in any type of judicial proceeding. Other 
provisions of the Court Interpreters Act remain unchanged, 
however, so that the provision of interpretation services for 
Government witnesses, for example, remains the financial 
responsibility of the Department of Justice under 28 U.S.C. 
1827(g)(3).

Sec. 309.--Technical amendment related to commencement date of 
        temporary bankruptcy judgeships

    Temporary judgeships were first established for bankruptcy 
judges in the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1992 (the 1992 act), 
which authorized 10 temporary judgeship positions. Temporary 
judgeship positions are intended to provide a court with a 
needed judgeship for a minimum of 5 years. However, the 
language of section 3(b) of the 1992 act followed language used 
for article III judges, which provided that a vacancy occurring 
5 years or more after the date of the enactment of the act 
shall not be filled.
    By linking the temporary judgeship terms (5 years) to the 
enactment date of a particular judgeship act, a district could 
lose most or all of the benefit of an authorized temporary 
judgeship position. The period between the effective date of a 
particular judgeship act and the time new judges actually take 
office to fill newly created positions is often years, due to 
delays in funding and selection processes.
    The article III judiciary has had temporary judgeships for 
years and has struggled with the harsh effects of linking the 
5-year period to the date of enactment of the particular 
judgeship act. Congress recognized this problem and passed 
legislation to amend the commencement date of certain temporary 
article III judgeships in Public Law 104-60.

Sec. 310.--Contribution rate for senior judges under the Judicial 
        Survivors' Annuities System

    This section corrects an anomaly between categories of 
disabled judges and their rate of contribution to the Judicial 
Survivors' Annuities System (JSAS) and provides equal treatment 
for all disabled judges. Currently, a senior judge who is 
disabled and retires under 28 U.S.C. 371(b) (senior status) 
contributes to the JSAS at a rate of 2.2 percent. However, a 
disabled judge who retires under 28 U.S.C. 372(a) (permanent 
disability) contributes to JSAS at a rate of 3.5 percent unless 
he or she is ``willing and able'' to work. This section applies 
a 2.2-percent contribution rate to all senior article III 
judges and all retired judges of the U.S. Court of Federal 
Claims.

Sec. 311.--Prohibition of awards of costs, including attorney's fees, 
        and injunctive relief against judicial officers

    This section restores the doctrine of judicial immunity to 
the status it occupied prior to the Supreme Court's decision in 
Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522 (1984), and has the support of 
the American Judges Association, the Conference of Chief Judges 
of the National Center for State Courts, and the American Bar 
Association. Legislation identical to section 311 was 
introduced as S. 1115 by Senator Thurmond in this Congress on 
August 3, 1995. Nearly identical bills were also introduced, 
and the subject of hearings in previous years, including the 
100th, the 101st and the 102d Congresses. While the Committee 
favorably reported these bills in each of three Congresses, the 
full Senate never considered them. See S. Rept. 556, 100th 
Cong., 2d sess. (1988); S. Rept. 465, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 
(1990); S. Rept. 224, 102d Cong., 1st sess. (1991).
    In Pulliam, the Supreme Court broke with 400 years of 
common-law tradition and weakened judicial immunity 
protections. The case concerned a State magistrate who jailed 
an individual for failing to post bond for an offense which 
could be punished only by a fine and not incarceration. The 
defendant filed an action under 42 U.S.C. 1983, obtaining both 
an injunction against the magistrate's practice of requiring 
bonds for nonincarcerable offenses, and an award of costs, 
including attorney's fees. The Supreme Court affirmed, 
expressly holding that judicial immunity is not a bar to 
injunctive relief in section 1983 actions against a State judge 
acting in a judicial capacity, or to the award of attorney's 
fees under the Civil Rights Attorney Fees Award Act, 42 U.S.C. 
1988. Those statutes are now amended to preclude awards of 
costs and attorney's fees against judges for acts taken in 
their judicial capacity, and to bar injunctive relief unless 
declaratory relief is inadequate.
    In the 12 years since Pulliam, thousands of Federal cases 
have been filed against judges and magistrates. The 
overwhelming majority of these cases lack merit and are 
ultimately dismissed. The record from the Committee's previous 
hearings on this issue is replete with examples of judges 
having to defend themselves against frivolous cases. Even when 
cases are routinely dismissed, the very process of defending 
against those actions is vexatious and subjects judges to undue 
expense. More importantly, the risk to judges of burdensome 
litigation creates a chilling effect that threatens judicial 
independence and may impair the day-to-day decisions of the 
judiciary in close or controversial cases.
    Subsection 311(a) codifies the general prohibition against 
holding judicial officers (justices, judges and magistrates) 
liable for costs, including attorney's fees, for acts or 
omissions taken in their judicial capacity. Subsection 311(b) 
amends 42 U.S.C. 1988 to prohibit holding judicial officers 
liable for costs or fees. Subsection 311(c) amends 42 U.S.C. 
1983 to bar a Federal judge from granting injunctive relief 
against a State judge, unless declaratory relief is unavailable 
or the State judge violated a declaratory decree. In short, 
subsection (a) states the general rule, while subsections (b) 
and (c) specifically address the statutes at issue in Pulliam. 
The legislation extends protection to Federal as well as State 
judicial officers out of concern that Federal judges otherwise 
might be subject to cost and fee awards in cases alleging 
Federal constitutional torts. See, e.g., Bivens v. Six Unknown 
Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 
(1977); Butz v. Economu, 438 U.S. 478 (1978).
    This section does not provide absolute immunity for 
judicial officers. Immunity is not granted for any conduct 
``clearly in excess'' of a judge's jurisdiction, even if the 
act is taken in a judicial capacity. Moreover, litigants may 
still seek declaratory relief, and may obtain injunctive relief 
if a declaratory decree is violated or is otherwise 
unavailable. Section 311 restores the full scope of judicial 
immunity lost in Pulliam and will go far in eliminating 
frivolous and harassing lawsuits which threaten the 
independence and objective decision-making essential to the 
judicial process.

              title iv--judicial financial administration

Sec. 401.--Increase in civil action filing fee

    In September 1992, the Judicial Conference, noting that 
civil filing fees had been increased from $15 to $60 in 1978 
and from $60 to $120 in 1986, recommended that 28 U.S.C. 
1914(a) be amended to increase the civil filing fee from $120 
to $150.
    This section increases the filing fee for civil actions in 
the district courts under 28 U.S.C. 1914 from $120 to $150. 
This modest adjustment affects only the initial ``user fee'' 
for all litigants not proceeding in forma pauperis under 28 
U.S.C. 1915. Although the initial filing fee of some State 
courts of General jurisdiction may be less, many States have 
add-on fees. For example, in 26 States courts charge a jury 
demand fee which can be as high as $300, according to the 
National Center for State Courts. Also, actual reimbursement 
fees for jury trials ordered in certain judgments run much 
higher, depending upon the length of trial. Other States impose 
a fee for filing an answer, requesting a trial, or filing a 
motion.
    Additionally, this section amends 28 U.S.C. 1931 to have 
the first $90 (rather than $60) of each fee deposited into the 
special judiciary fund in the Treasury to be available to 
offset funds appropriated for the operation and maintenance of 
the courts. As a result, the judiciary would receive about $6.6 
million annually, according to the Judicial Conference, thereby 
reducing the need for direct appropriations.
    The section provides for a 60-day delay in the effective 
date in the proposed increase to the civil filing fee. This 
delay would allow clerks of court to implement the filing fee 
increase.

Sec. 402. Interpreter performance examination fees

    Since the enactment in 1978 of the Court Interpreters Act, 
28 U.S.C. 1827, the Administrative Office has been responsible 
for the development and administration of interpreter 
certification examinations. From 1985 to the present, the 
Administrative Office has contracted with the University of 
Arizona to perform this function. Under this contract, the 
contractor may charge a fee to offset costs of developing and 
administering the exam. For the Spanish certification exam, the 
fees collected by the University defray a significant portion 
of the cost.
    While this contracting approach has been followed for 
almost a decade, a review of the program has raised some 
concerns about the validity of contract language permitting the 
contractor to collect fees and budget funds without clear 
statutory authorization. Accordingly, this section amends 28 
U.S.C. 1827 to expressly authorize the Director of the 
Administrative Office to prescribe fees for examinations given 
for the purpose of certifying qualified interpreters, and to 
permit the contractor to collect and retain some or all of the 
fees as direct payment for contract services. The section also 
validates such provisions in current and past contracts. Any 
funds collected after this section takes effect that are not 
retained by a contractor are to be deposited into the 
offsetting fund established under 28 U.S.C. 1931.

Sec. 403.--Judicial panel on multidistrict litigation

    Several provisions of title 28, United States Code, 
authorize the Judicial Conference to establish miscellaneous 
fee schedules for the Federal, appellate, district, claims and 
bankruptcy courts. The Judiciary's 1991 Appropriations Act 
provided permanent authority for fees charged for electronic 
public access to these courts' databases to be deposited into 
the Judiciary Automation Fund, which pays the costs of 
providing those services. Currently, the Judicial Panel on 
Multidistrict Litigation is included in these statutes. The 
purpose of this section is to establish conformity in the 
Federal judiciary by authorizing the Judicial Conference to 
establish a miscellaneous fee schedule for the panel and by 
authorizing the deposit of electronic public access fees 
collected by the panel into the Judiciary Automation Fund.

Sec. 404.--Disposition of Fees

    This section allows the judiciary to retain the revenue 
from increases above current levels in (1) attorney admission 
fees, (2) duplicate admission certificates, and (3) 
certificates of good standing. It is anticipated that if such 
legislation were enacted, the Judicial Conference would raise 
the attorney admission fee from $20 to $50, and raise fees for 
duplicate judiciary certificates and certificates of good 
standing from $5 to $15. This would provide about $2 million 
annually for the judiciary.
    This section also allows the judiciary to retain additional 
revenues derived from increases in fees for filing an adversary 
complaint in bankruptcy cases. Item 6 of the Bankruptcy Court 
Miscellaneous Fee Schedule, which was adopted by the Judicial 
Conference pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1930, provides that the fee 
charged for filing a complaint be the same amount as the filing 
fee prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 1914(a) for instituting any civil 
action other than a writ of habeas corpus.
    Additionally, this section provides that the additional $30 
from each bankruptcy complaint filing is to be deposited into 
the special judiciary fund in the Treasury. These revenues 
would be available to offset funds appropriated for the 
operation and maintenance of the courts.

        title v--federal courts study committee recommendations

Sec. 501.--Parties' consent to bankruptcy judge's findings and 
        conclusions of law

    Section 157(c)(1) of title 28, United States Code, provides 
that a bankruptcy judge may hear a noncore proceeding that is 
otherwise related to a case under title 11 and, in such 
proceeding, shall submit to the district court proposed 
findings of fact and conclusions of law. Any final order or 
judgment must be entered by the district judge after 
considering the findings of fact and conclusions of law and 
reviewing any matters to which any party has ``timely and 
specifically objected.'' Even when no party objects to what the 
bankruptcy judge has proposed, the bankruptcy judge may not 
proceed to enter appropriate orders and judgments without 
``express'' consent of all of the parties as provided in the 
Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.
    Subsection (c)(1) proceedings are to be distinguished from 
subsection (c)(2) proceedings in which all parties have agreed 
at the outset that the bankruptcy judge may hear, determine, 
and enter appropriate orders and judgments, subject only to 
regular appeal procedures.
    The result is that subsection (c)(1) proceedings impose a 
time-consuming procedure on the system that is extremely and 
unnecessarily wasteful of article III judicial resources by 
requiring article III judge consideration of findings of fact 
and conclusions of law proposed by the bankruptcy judge to 
which there is no objection by any of the parties and article 
III judge entry of appropriate orders and judgments. Moreover, 
in default cases, implied consent is particularly important to 
prevent unnecessary delays.
    This section deals with the problem by amending subsection 
(c)(1) to provide that a party will be deemed to have consented 
to the findings of fact and conclusions of law proposed by the 
bankruptcy judge unless the party files a timely objection--
within 10 days under rule 9033 of the Federal Rules of 
Bankruptcy Procedure--after which time the findings and 
conclusions become final and the bankruptcy judge may enter an 
appropriate order in the case. By making provision for implied 
consent in the absence of timely objection, this section 
resolves the problem of totally unnecessary delay in default 
cases where persons cannot be located, promotes the economic 
use of both judicial and party resources where no party in fact 
objects, and does so without denying an objecting party the 
opportunity to seek article III de novo consideration of 
noncore proceedings.

Sec. 502.--Qualification of chief judge of Court of International Trade

    Under existing 28 U.S.C. 251(b), the President designates 
one of the nine judges of the court, who is less than 70 years 
old, to serve as chief judge. The designated chief judge 
continues to serve as chief judge until the judge reaches the 
age of 70 and the President designates another judge chief 
judge.
    The method for selecting the chief judges of the other 
article III courts provides that the chief judge of the court 
shall be the judge in regular service who is senior in 
commission of those judges who (a) is 64 years of age or under; 
(b) has served as a judge of the court for at least 1 year; and 
(c) has not previously served as chief judge.
    This method of selection was reviewed by the Federal Courts 
Study Committee, which recommended that this method not be 
changed. In particular, the committee report stated:

          The modified seniority method of chief judge 
        selection established in 1982 (see 28 U.S.C. 45 & 136) 
        is not faultless, but it operates well in practice and 
        is preferable to any other method. The statutorily 
        specified term for chief judges is a definite 
        improvement over the previous pattern of very short or 
        very long periods of service.

    This section changes the system for selecting the chief 
judge of the Court of International Trade to conform with the 
modified seniority system applicable to every other article III 
court. This significantly improves the political selection of a 
chief judge by the President and has the support of the 
Judicial Conference of the United States.

Sec 503.--Judicial cost-of-living adjustments

    This section repeals a provision enacted in a continuing 
appropriation resolution in 1981 that bars annual cost-of-
living adjustments in pay for Federal judges except as 
specifically authorized by Congress. While the sponsors of the 
provision applied it only to a single year, the Comptroller 
General ruled that it was permanent law. However, the 
Comptroller General recommended repeal of section 140 of Public 
Law 97-92 to the 99th Congress. Instead, Congress adopted the 
practice of suspending application of section 140 to discrete 
cost-of-living raises. Repeal of section 140 restores the 
operation of 28 U.S.C. 461 as to article III judges and parity 
with the other two branches of Government, as enacted by the 
Federal Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1975 and 
amended by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989.

                        title vi--miscellaneous

Sec. 601.--Participation in judicial governance activities by district, 
        senior, and magistrate judges

    Currently, 28 U.S.C. 331 provides, in relevant part, that 
``[t]he district judge to be summoned [to the Judicial 
Conference] from each judicial circuit shall be chosen by the 
circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual 
judicial conference of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 
of this title *  *  * .'' In 1990, 28 U.S.C. 333 was amended to 
permit the circuit judicial conferences to be held biennially 
instead of annually. This raised the question of whether the 
circuit and district judges could elect their district court 
representative to the Judicial Conference without holding an 
annual meeting. The General Counsel's office of the 
Administrative Office of the United States Courts concluded 
that it was reasonable to assume the judges could make this 
decision without a formal meeting, but recommended a technical 
amendment. Accordingly, this section amends 28 U.S.C. 331 to 
authorize each judicial conference to choose a representative 
in accordance with rules adopted by the judicial conference of 
the circuit.

Sec. 602.--The Director and Deputy Director of the Administrative 
        Office as officers of the United States

    The Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-650) 
changed the authority for appointment of the Director and 
Deputy Director of the Administrative Office from the Supreme 
Court to the Chief Justice (after consulting with the Judicial 
Conference). In so doing, it appears Congress inadvertently 
eliminated these two positions from the definition of 
``officer'' of the United States under 5 U.S.C. 2104, which 
defines an ``officer of the United States'' for purposes of 
title 5, United States Code. While qualification of these 
positions under the definition of ``employee'' of the United 
States prevents inadvertent disqualification for certain 
benefits, the positions should be clearly included under the 
term ``officer.''

Sec. 603.--Removal of action from State court

    This section conforms 28 U.S.C. 1446(c)(1) to the language 
in the rest of the section by substituting ``defendant or 
defendants'' for ``petitioner.''

Sec. 604.--Federal Judicial Center employee retirement provisions

    This section clarifies 28 U.S.C. 627(b) to remove any doubt 
that eligible Federal Judicial Center staff, including the 
Deputy Director, are covered by the Federal Employees 
Retirement System (FERS) under 5 U.S.C. 8401 et seq.

Sec. 605.--Abolition of the Special Court, Regional Rail 
        Reauthorization Act of 1973

    This section abolishes the Special Court that was 
established in the early 1970's to oversee the reorganization 
of insolvent railroads. That court's caseload has declined to 
less than 10 cases, none of which involve significant activity. 
The section transfers the Special Court's jurisdiction over 
those cases and any future rail reorganization proceedings to 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where the 
court's records and a majority of its judges are currently 
located, and makes other changes incidental to the court's 
abolition. As there is already an established, uniform body of 
law regarding these matters, it is easier to maintain that 
unified body of law within one court. Further, the precedential 
value of the Special Court will be retained and the 
jurisprudence of the Special Court will be adopted by the 
District Court for the District of Columbia for the purpose of 
deciding these cases.
    More specifically, subsection (a) amends 45 U.S.C. 719 to 
provide that the Special Court is abolished after a 90-day 
transition period. At the end of the transition period, the 
District Court for the District of Columbia assumes 
responsibility for the Special Court's remaining docket and 
acquires the latter's exclusive, nationwide jurisdiction under 
the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, the Northeast 
Rail Service Act of 1981, the Conrail Privatization Act, and 
related statutes. Subsection (a) also deems all statutory or 
regulatory references to the Special Court to refer to the 
District Court for the District of Columbia for purposes of any 
proceedings after the Special Court is abolished.
    Subsection (b) provides that appeals in rail reorganization 
cases decided by the District Court for the District of 
Columbia shall lie in the Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit.
    Subsection (c) makes necessary conforming amendments. 
Subsection (d) provides that cases pending at the time of the 
Special Court's abolition will be assigned to the District 
Court for the District of Columbia as if they had been filed 
originally in that court. Subsection (e) provides that the 
amendments concerning appellate review and the conforming 
amendments become effective 90 days after enactment. The 
appellate review amendments, however, do not apply to any final 
order or judgment entered by the Special Court, which is a 
three-judge court, for which a petition for writ of certiorari 
has already been filed or the time for filing such petition has 
not expired.

Sec. 606.--Place of holding court in the District Court of Utah

    This section implements the endorsement of the Judicial 
Conference Committee on Court Administration and Case 
Management to add Provo and St. George as a place of holding 
court in the District of Utah. The committee's endorsement was 
influenced by the fact that the District Court for the District 
of Utah made a budget-neutral proposal.
    In a letter to Robert Hoecker, circuit executive for the 
Tenth Judicial Circuit, dated May 10, 1996, the Honorable David 
Winder, chief judge for the District Court for the District of 
Utah, stated that the court did not intend to request or pursue 
funding for the acquisition of a building site or the 
construction of court facilities in either location. In 
addition, Chief Judge Winder indicated that the court did not 
intend, in the near future, to seek rental space in either 
location for the purpose of conducting court.

Sec. 607.--Exception of residency requirement for district judges 
        appointed to the Southern District and Eastern District of New 
        York

    This section amends 28 U.S.C. 134(b) to allow judges from 
the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York to reside within 
20 miles of the district to which they were appointed.
    Title 28 U.S.C. 134(b) requires district court judges to 
reside in the district to which they were appointed. The 
underlying policy for this statute is that judges should reside 
in the community in which they administer the law. Because of 
its unique geographic status, judges appointed to the District 
of Columbia District are already exempt from this requirement.
    As with judges, and for similar policy reasons, U.S. 
attorneys are required to reside in the district to which they 
are appointed. However, there are three exceptions to this 
requirement: the District of Columbia; the Eastern District of 
New York; and the Southern District of New York. In these three 
exceptions, the U.S. attorneys may reside within 20 miles of 
the district. This section applies the same residency 
requirements presently in effect for U.S. attorneys in the 
Southern and Eastern Districts of New York to Federal district 
judges in those districts.

Sec. 608.--Extension of civil justice expense and delay reduction 
        reports on pilot and demonstration programs.

    Section 608 amends sections 104(d) and 105(c) of the Civil 
Justice Reform Act (CJRA) of 1990 to extend to June 30, 1997, 
the date by which the Judicial Conference is required to submit 
reports on the CJRA demonstration program and the CJRA pilot 
program.
    Section 105 of the CJRA requires the Judicial Conference to 
transmit to Congress a final report containing recommendations 
on the implementation of cost and delay reduction programs in 
the Federal district courts. These recommendations are to be 
based on the results of the independent assessment of the CJRA 
pilot and comparison courts presently being conducted by the 
RAND Corporation.
    Section 104 of the CJRA imposes the additional requirement 
that the Judicial Conference submit a separate report on the 
district courts that participated in the act's demonstration 
program. For the sake of consistency, section 104 of the CJRA 
is amended to state that this report is also due on June 30, 
1997.

Sec. 609.--Extension of arbitration

    This section extends the authorization of appropriations of 
the use of arbitration by certain district courts under 28 
U.S.C. 651 by 1 year.

Sec. 610.--State Justice Institute

            Subsection (a)--Authorization of appropriations
    Subsection (a) amends section 215 of the State Justice 
Insititute Act of 1984 (``Act''), 42 U.S.C. 10713, by 
authorizing annual appropriations of $12,500,000 for fiscal 
year 1997, fiscal year 1998, fiscal year 1999, and fiscal year 
2000. The amendment also provides that amounts appropriated for 
the Institute are to remain available until expended, and new 
restrictions are placed on the disbursement of funds.
    The Institute is unique in statutory duty to ``further the 
development and adoption of improved judicial administration in 
State courts in the United States.'' [42 U.S.C. 10702(a)]. The 
Institute has the only authority to assist all State courts and 
the only mandate to share the success of one State's 
innovations with every State and the Federal court system. Its 
duties include fostering coordination and cooperation with the 
Federal judiciary in areas of mutual concern, and it is 
authorized to participate in joint projects with other 
agencies, including the Federal Judicial Center.
    The Institute plays an important role in the Nation's 
response to crime by providing necessary funding to support 
projects that evaluate the effectiveness of new trial and 
sentencing approaches, and improve judges' performance in cases 
involving violent crimes and drug abuse. The Institute also has 
been a leader in fostering improvements in the civil justice 
system by supporting efforts to evaluate new procedures to 
reduce litigation delay, demonstrate innovative alternative 
dispute resolution programs and increase the public's access to 
the legal system.
    The Institute has several national roles that are not 
filled by other entities. They include for example:
    Supporting national evaluations of promising State and 
local improvements to the criminal and civil justice systems;
    Serving as an information clearinghouse to share 
information quickly on a nationwide basis; and
    Establishing national resource centers where judges and 
court officials can test new technologies, observe new 
approaches to administering court systems and sit in classroom 
settings to learn from each other.
            Subsection (b)--Executive committee
    Subsection (b) amends section 204(j) of the act, 42 U.S.C. 
10703(j), by inserting the phrase ``(on such occasions as it 
has been delegated the authority to act for the Board)'' after 
``executive committee of the Board.'' This amendment would 
require meetings of a committee of the board of directors to be 
open to the public only when the board had delegated the 
committee the authority to conduct or dispose of Institute 
business on its behalf.
            Subsection (c)--Howell Heflin Award
    Subsection (c) adds a new subsection (7) to section 204(k) 
of the act, 42 U.S.C. 10703(k), directing the Institute's board 
of directors to present an annual Howell Heflin Award in 
recognition of an innovative SJI-funded project that has a high 
likelihood of significantly improving the quality of justice in 
State courts across the Nation.
            Subsection (d)--Priority in making awards
    Subsection (d) amends section 206(b) of the act, 42 U.S.C. 
10705(b), by inserting a new paragraph (1) according State and 
local courts, and their agencies, the highest funding priority 
under the Act.
            Subsection (e)--Geographical distribution of grants
    Subsection (e) adds a new paragraph (7) to section 206(b) 
of the act, 42 U.S.C. 10705(b), directing the Institute to 
undertake outreach efforts to assure the widest feasible 
geographical distribution of grant funds and benefits, 
consistent with its mission to award grants having the greatest 
likelihood of improving the quality of justice nationwide.
            Subsection (f)--Nonsupplantation
    Subsection (f) of the bill extends the nonsupplantation 
provision of section 207(d) of the act, 42 U.S.C. 10706(d), to 
private organizations, and restricts the use of Institute grant 
funds awarded to bar associations.
            Subsection (g)--Reports to Congress
    Subsection (g) requires that, beginning January 1, 1997, 
the Institute provide semi-annual reports to the Senate and 
House Judiciary Committees identifying all grants made by the 
Institute during the preceding 6 months, including the name and 
address of the grantee, the purpose of the project, the amount 
of funding provided, and the duration of the project.

                     V. Regulatory Impact Statement

    Pursuant to paragraph 11(b), rule XXVI of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate, the committee, after due consideration, 
concludes that Senate bill 1887 will not have significant 
regulatory impact.

                           VI. Cost Estimate

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                 Washington, DC, September 6, 1996.
Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S.1887, the Federal 
Courts Improvement Act of 1996.
    Enacting S. 1887 would affect direct spending. Therefore, 
pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to this bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).
    Enclosure.

               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE--Cost estimate

    1. Bill number: S. 1887.
    2. Bill title: Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary on July 30, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: S. 1887 would make numerous operational 
and administrative changes to the federal court system. 
Provisions that would have significant budgetary effects 
include section 309, which would allow the terms of certain 
bankruptcy judgeships to be extended; sections 401 and 404, 
which would increase offsetting receipts and the spending of 
such receipts by increasing civil filing fees and other 
miscellaneous fees; and section 610, which would authorize 
appropriations for the State Justice Institute.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: As shown in 
the following table, enacting S. 1887 would increase 
discretionary spending by $52 million over the 1997-2002 
period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds, and 
would increase mandatory spending by $1 million over the same 
period.

    The costs of this bill fall within budget function 750.
    6. Basis of estimate: The only substantial budgetary impact 
from enacting S. 1887 would result from the authorization of 
appropriations for the State Justice Institute. The bill would 
authorize $12.5 million a year for the fiscal years 1997 
through 2000. If these amounts are appropriated, additional 
outlays would total $50 million over the 1997-2002 period. This 
organization received an appropriation of $5 million for fiscal 
year 1996. Other provisions of the bill are discussed below.

Title I

    Section 101 of this title would allow probation officers 
and pretrial officers to carry firearms with the approval of 
Federal district courts and according to the rules and 
regulations prescribed by the Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts (AOUSC). Currently, the Judicial 
Conference of the United States maintains an informal policy 
that enables these officers to carry firearms if allowed under 
existing state and local law. As a result of this policy, a 
firearms training program is in operation and surplus firearms 
from other agencies are provided to the officers in the 
program. Thus far, overall expenses for this program have been 
minimal. According to the AOUSC, about 60 percent of the 
probation officers and pretrial services officers currently 
carry firearms, and enacting this bill would probably not 
increase participation in the firearms program significantly. 
Thus, CBO estimates that enacting this provision would not have 
a significant budgetary impact.
    Section 102 would eliminate malpractice coverage for 
federal public defenders under the Federal Tort Claims Act 
(Public Law 89-506). Because public defenders would still be 
eligible for malpractice coverage under the Criminal Justice 
Act Revision of 1986 (Public Law 99-651), CBO estimates that 
enacting this provision would have no impact on the Federal 
budget.

Title II

    This title contains two provisions that could affect the 
number of cases that are tried in Federal courts. First, 
section 206 would increase the threshold for diversity cases, 
which are cases between citizens of different States, that can 
be heard in Federal court, from $50,000 to $75,000. According 
to the AOUSC, increasing this threshold would exclude about 
3,000 to 6,000 civil cases each year from access to Federal 
courts. Because the courts' backlog for civil cases is so 
large, CBO estimates that any reduction in caseload would have 
a negligible impact on the budget for the Federal court system.
    Second, section 208 would allow civil actions and criminal 
actions against Federal agencies and federal officers to be 
removed from state court to a federal district court. According 
to the National Center for State Courts, very few of these 
cases are currently tried in State court. Hence, CBO estimates 
that enacting this provision would not significantly increase 
the Federal caseload and thus would not have any significant 
impact on the federal budget.
    Section 211 would require judges, before sealing the files 
on certain civil cases, to determine if restricting access to 
court documents would affect public health or safety. The 
impact of this provision on caseload is highly uncertain. Based 
on information from the AOUSC, CBO expects that enacting this 
provision could increase the number of cases that are settled 
prior to filing in court. Such settlements would prevent the 
possibility that the details of an adverse finding on behalf of 
a defendant would become available to the public. On the other 
hand, CBO anticipates that under certain circumstances the 
number of appeals could increase as defendants attempt to 
restore their reputations after receiving adverse rulings that 
are made public. On balance, CBO concludes that the net impact 
of enacting this provision is likely to be small.
    CBO estimates that the other changes that would affect 
judicial process contained in this title would have no 
significant budgetary impact.

Title III

    Section 305 would give certain Federal judges the authority 
to carry firearms. Based on information from the AOUSC, CBO 
does not expect that a significant number of judges would opt 
to carry firearms. Furthermore, a firearms training program is 
in operation and surplus firearms from other agencies would be 
available for use by the judges. Thus, CBO estimates that 
enacting this provision would not have a significant budgetary 
effect.
    Section 308 would require the courts, subject to the 
availability of appropriated funds, to provide sign-language 
interpreters as necessary during any type of judicial 
proceeding. Under current law, such services are provided in 
some cases. Based on information from the AOUSC, CBO estimates 
that it would cost the courts about $40,000 annually to provide 
court interpreters in additional cases.
    Section 309 would amend the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 
1992 (Public Law 102-361), which created 10 temporary judgeship 
positions and required that the next vacancy in each of the 10 
affected district courts occurring five years after the 
effective date of the act (August 26, 1992) not be filled. 
Enacting section 309 would change the controlling date for 
leaving vacancies unfilled to five years after the confirmation 
date of the temporary judge, rather than five years after the 
effective date of the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1992. Based 
on information from the AOUSC, CBO estimates that over the next 
five years about two more workyears for judges would be 
incurred under the bill than under current law. We estimate 
that enacting section 309 would result in about $1 million in 
new mandatory spending from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal 
year 2002 for salaries and benefits of judges. Salaries and 
benefits for support personnel and other expenditures related 
to the judgeships, which would require an appropriation, are 
estimated to cost about $2 million over the same period.
    The other sections under this title would make various 
changes that would affect the salaries and benefits for 
judiciary personnel. However, based on information from the 
AOUSC, CBO does not estimate that any of those changes would 
affect a significant number of judicial personnel. Thus, CBO 
estimates that neither discretionary nor mandatory spending 
would significantly increase by enacting these sections.

Title IV

    Two of the four sections under this title would increase 
offsetting collections and the spending of such receipts. 
First, section 401 would increase the filing fee for filing a 
civil action in district court from $120 to $150. Also, this 
section would increase the portion of this fee that would be 
deposited into the special judiciary fund in the Treasury to be 
used to finance activities of the AOUSC. Currently, this fund 
retains $60 of the $120 fee and enacting this section would 
require that an additional $30 (that is, $90 of the $150 fee) 
be deposited into this fund. According to the AOUSC, filing 
fees are eventually paid either at time of filing or at 
conclusion of a case in about 220,000 civil actions each year. 
Thus, CBO estimates that enacting this section would increase 
offsetting collections by about $7 million each year, beginning 
in 1997.
    Next, section 404 would allow the judiciary to retain 
revenue from future increases in fees paid for attorneys' 
admission to the Federal district bar, duplicate admission 
certificates, certificates of good standing, and filing an 
adversary complaint in bankruptcy cases. CBO expects that the 
Judicial Conference of the United States would increase such 
fees following enactment of this bill. We estimate the increase 
would generate about $3 million in offsetting collections each 
year. Because these collections as well as the amounts 
collected under section 401 would be spent without 
appropriations action, CBO estimates that enacting these 
provisions would have no net impact on the federal budget.

Title V

    Section 503 under this title would repeal a provision that 
bars annual cost-of-living adjustments in pay for judges except 
as specifically authorized by the Congress. CBO estimates that 
enacting this section would have no impact on the federal 
budget (relative to the budget resolution baseline) because the 
baseline already assumes cost-of-living pay raises for judges.
    The other provisions under this title would make minor 
changes to court procedures and we estimate that enacting them 
would not result in any cost to the government.

Title VI

    Section 605 under this title would abolish the Special 
Court that was established under the Regional Rail 
Reorganization Act of 1973 to oversee the reorganization of 
insolvent railroads. The court's current proceedings, which 
consist of less than 10 cases, and any future cases would be 
transferred to the district court for the District of Columbia. 
Based on information from the AOUSC, CBO estimates that 
eliminating this court would result in annual cost savings of 
about $200,000, assuming that appropriations were reduced 
accordingly.
    Section 609 would extend the authorization for 
appropriations from fiscal year 1997 to 1998 for the use of 
arbitration by certain district courts. Based on historical 
expenditures for the arbitration program, CBO estimates that 
the district courts would require an appropriation of this 
purpose of about $500,000 in fiscal year 1998.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets 
up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct 
spending or receipts through 1998. The various fee increases 
under Title IV would affect direct spending. However, because 
these fees, which are recorded as offsetting collections, would 
be mostly spend in the same year in which they are collected, 
CBO estimates that enacting the fee provisions would have no 
significant net impact on direct spending in each year. Because 
additional mandatory spending for the salaries and benefits for 
bankruptcy judges would not begin until fiscal year 1999, these 
amounts would not affect pay-as-you-go scoring.

    8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: Intergovernmental Mandates. S. 1887 contains 
several intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4). CBO estimates 
that the aggregate net cost of these mandates for state, local 
and tribal governments would total, at most, $1 million 
annually--well below the $50 million threshold established in 
Public Law 104-4.
    Preemption of certain state and local gun laws. The bill 
would preempt some state and local laws by authorizing federal 
pretrial and probation officers and certain federal judges to 
carry guns. According to information from the AOUSC, nine 
states prohibit judges and other non-exempt citizens from 
carrying concealed weapons and at least one state prohibits the 
same for pretrial officers. In addition, many of these 
officials who must travel across state and municipal borders 
find that their existing state authorization is not always 
legal in bordering areas. (Generally there is a residency 
requirement to obtain a permit to carry a gun in an area). The 
regulations implementing these provisions would also preclude 
the need for these federal officials to obtain permits or 
licenses from state and local governments.
    Currently, federal pretrial and probation officers pay less 
than $2,000 a year in gun permit fees to three states. Based on 
information from the AOUSC and firearm associations, CBO 
estimates that less than half of the approximately 2,000 
federal judges affected by the provision have gun permits, for 
which they pay less than $25,000 annually to state and local 
governments in permit fees. Reductions in fee revenues would be 
slightly offset by savings in administrative costs. CBO 
concludes that providing these officials federal authorization 
to carry guns would result in a net loss of revenues for state 
and local governments totaling less than $25,000 per year.
    Increase in civil action filing fees. The bill would 
increase the fee that parties, including state, local, and 
tribal governments, must pay to file civil actions in U.S. 
district courts. S. 1887 would raise the fee to $150 per filing 
(an increase of $30). According to the AOUSC, only a fraction 
of the 220,000 such cases filed annually are filed by state, 
local, or tribal governments. CBO estimates the costs to these 
governments of paying the increased fees would be less than $1 
million per year.
    Elimination of ability to collect attorney fees and 
injunctive relief in certain cases. The bill would prohibit 
prevailing parties, including state, local, and tribal 
governments, from collecting attorney fees and other costs and 
from obtaining injunctive relief in certain cases brought 
against judicial officers. However, very few of these types of 
cases are decided in favor of the plaintiff each year. 
Therefore, CBO estimates that any losses for state, local, and 
tribal governments in the form of forgone compensation would be 
negligible.
    Other Impacts on State, Local and Tribal Governments. A 
number of other provisions in S. 1887 would result in some 
costs to state, local, and tribal governments. These costs, 
however, would not result from mandates as defined in Public 
Law 104-4.
    First, the bill would require parties, including state, 
local, and tribal governments, who seek to restrict access to 
records in a civil case to provide additional information to 
the court. Second, by raising the threshold value that 
establishes the access of certain cases to U.S. district 
courts, the bill would add 3,000-6,000 civil cases a year to 
the dockets of state courts. CBO estimates that these provision 
would have an insignificant impact on the budgets of state, 
local and tribal governments.
    S. 1887 would also authorize the appropriation of $12.5 
million to the State Justice Institute (SJI) for each of fiscal 
years 1997-2000--exactily half the amount authorized under 
current law in each of the previous two fiscal years. SJI's 
fiscal year 1996 appropriation, however, was only $5 million. A 
quasi-governmental entity established by federal law, SJI's 
mission is to improve judicial administration in state courts 
through, among other activities, grants to state and local 
governments. The bill would amend the prioritization in making 
awards, giving state and local courts priority over other 
organizations in receiving grants and other assistance from 
SJI.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: S. 1887 would 
impose new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4. First, section 311 would prohibit prevailing parties in 
certain cases brought against judicial officers from collecting 
attorney's fees and other costs, and from obtaining injunctive 
relief. Second, section 401 would increase the filing fee that 
parties who institute civil actions in federal district courts 
are required to pay. That fee would be increased to $150 from 
its current law amount of $120. Third, section 402 would 
authorize the Director of the AOUSC to develop a performance-
based system of certification for court interpreters, and to 
charge fees to interpreters for purposes of obtaining 
certification.
    CBO estimates that the direct costs associated with new 
private-sector mandates in the bill would fall well-below the 
$100 million threshold specified in Public Law 104-4. 
Increasing the civil action filing fee would result in 
additional payments by the private sector of about $7 million 
per year. While the prohibition on cost recovery and injunctive 
relief in certain cases brought against judicial officers could 
impose substantial costs on private-sector parties in specific 
cases, the aggregate costs imposed on the private sector by 
this prohibition would be insignificant because very few cases 
of this type are decided in favor of the plaintiff each year. 
Lastly, authorizing the AOUSC Director to develop a 
certification system for court interpreters and to charge 
testing fees would essentially codifying existing practices. 
Thus, the direct cost of section 402 would be zero.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: On May 13, 1996, CBO transmitted 
a cost estimate for S. 1474, a bill to provide new authority 
for probation and pretrial services officers and for other 
purposes, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary on May 2, 1996. Section 101 of this bill is identical 
to S. 1474. The other provisions of S. 1887, as approved by the 
Senate Committee on the Judiciary, were not included in S. 
1474.

Mehlman; State and Local Government Impact: Karen McVey; and

Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.
                 VII. ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF MR. GRASSLEY

    The so-called Sunshine in Litigation Act, offered by 
Senator Kohl and narrowly adopted by the Committee, rests on 
the flawed premise that protective orders issued under rule 26 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure restrict consumer 
access to information about dangerous and defective products. 
This contention presumes that information about defective 
products obtained through discovery cannot be obtained by 
consumers from other sources. However, the proponents of this 
legislation cannot point to any reliable study indicating that 
protective orders are the only source of information regarding 
defective products. In this information-saturated era, with the 
Internet accessible to consumers and networks of plaintiff 
attorneys trading information, it is not reasonable to believe 
that consumers are making ill-informed choices because of 
protective orders. When similar legislation was considered in 
the 103d Congress, the Committee received testimony from Prof 
Arthur Miller of the Harvard Law School, as well as from 
representatives from industry and well-respected Federal judges 
that information regarding defective products is available from 
a variety of sources. As there is no evidence suggesting that 
information about defective products contained in protective 
orders is not available from other sources, protective orders 
cannot be described as causing harm to consumers.
    The amendment requires Federal judges to make specific 
determinations that an order issued under rule 26 will not 
restrict the disclosure of information ``which is relevant to 
public health or safety'' prior to issuing such an order. This 
will obviously require judges to hold more hearings and will 
require litigants to spend more money attempting to comply with 
the amendment. Importantly, the phrase ``public health or 
safety'' is never defined. This will open the door to 
senseless, and potentially vexatious, litigation as judges and 
litigants attempt to discover the parameters of this vague 
requirement. If interpreted liberally, ``relevant to public 
health and safety'' could encompass virtually anything related 
to public health or safety no matter how attenuated or weak the 
relationship between the information and some potential harm. 
This makes for poor public policy, and the Congress ought not 
to open such a Pandora's box.
    Significantly, the balancing of interests which the 
Sunshine in Litigation Act seeks to create already exists in 
large measure. To prevent harm to the public, Federal courts 
routinely refuse to issue protective orders, or set protective 
orders aside., See., e.g., Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 
F.3d 772 (3d Cir. 1994); Leucadia, Inc. v. Applied Extrusion 
Technologies, 998 F.2d 157 (3d Cir. 1993); S.E.C. v. Van 
Waeyenberghe, 990 F.2d 845 (5th Cir. 1993); Pocono Artesian 
Waters v. Leffler Systems, 1194 U.S. Dist. Lexis 138 (E.D. Pa. 
1994). To the extent that protective orders can pose a risk to 
consumers, this concern can be, and is being, addressed 
appropriately under existing law. In short, the Sunshine in 
Litigation Act purports to cure a problem with Federal law 
which does not exist.
    Finally, Senator Kohl's amendment may have a deleterious 
effect on civil litigation. Under the liberal discovery rules 
in Federal court, parties to litigation can obtain highly 
sensitive information such as trade secrets or medical and 
psychiatric records. Since the phrase `'public health or 
safety'' used in the Sunshine in Litigation Act is vague on its 
face and is undefined in the amendment, litigants may face the 
unfair prospect of turning over sensitive, secret information 
with no assurance that such information will be held in 
confidence. This, in turn, creates a disincentive for litigants 
to cooperate in discovery and would give one side in litigation 
an opportunity to use confidential information as leverage to 
coerce the other side into a settlement. And lack of 
cooperation means that the workload of the Federal judiciary 
will increase as judges become involved in more discovery 
disputes which will slow the process of resolving lawsuits.
    In conclusion, the Sunshine in Litigation Act is 
unnecessary, expensive and will negatively affect the ability 
of Federal courts to dispense justice expeditiously. There is 
no evidence, other than flawed anecdotes, that protective 
orders issued under rule 26 have caused harm to consumers. 
Judge Patrick E. Higginbotham, the Chairman of the Judicial 
Conference's Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, testified on 
April 20, 1994, that, while there is no evidence that 
protective orders have caused harm to consumers, there is every 
reason to believe that requiring particularized factual 
determinations of the sort contained in Senator Kohl's 
amendment will make discovery in civil trials more difficult 
and time-consuming. Thus, the benefits of Senator Kohl's 
amendment are highly speculative at best while the negative 
consequences (slower and more expensive discovery, new 
litigation to define vague terms, the threat of the damaging 
disclosure of private information) would be substantial. Rather 
than imposing costly new burdens on Federal courts in an effort 
to protect consumers, it would be better to ensure that 
consumers have better access to product information so that 
they can make informed choices.

                   VIII. ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF MR. KOHL

    At the markup, we added a new section to the Federal Courts 
Improvements Act that addresses the growing abuse of secrecy 
orders issued by courts. All too often, our courts have allowed 
vital information that is discovered in litigation--and which 
directly bears on public health and safety--to be covered up: 
to be shielded from families whose lives are potentially at 
stake, and from the public officials we have appointed to 
protect our health and safety.
    All this happens because of the use of so-called protective 
orders--really ``gag'' orders issued by courts--that are 
designed to keep information discovered in the course of 
litigation secret and undisclosed. Typically, injured victims 
agree to a defendant's request to keep lawsuit information 
secret. They agree because defendants threaten that, without 
secrecy, they will refuse to pay a settlement. Victims cannot 
afford to take such chances. And while courts in these 
situations actually have the legal authority to deny requests 
for secrecy, typically they do not--because both sides have 
agreed, and judges have other matters they prefer to attend to.
    This provision will bring crucial information out of the 
darkness and into the light. It requires that judges weigh the 
impact on public health and safety before approving these 
secrecy orders. It is simple, effective, and straightforward. 
The provisions codifies what is already the practice of the 
best judges. In cases that do not affect public health safety, 
existing practice would continue, and courts could still issue 
protective orders as they do today. But in cases affecting 
public health and safety courts would apply a balancing test: 
they could permit secrecy only if the need for privacy 
outweighs the pubic's need to know about potential health or 
safety hazards. Moreover, courts could not, under this 
amendment, issue protective orders that would prevent 
disclosures to regulatory agencies.
    The problem of excessive secrecy orders in cases involving 
public health and safety has been apparent to the Committee for 
many years. The Committee first held hearings on this issue in 
1990. ``Court Secrecy,'' Hearings before the Subcommittee on 
Courts and Administrative Practice, Committee on the Judiciary 
(May 17, 1990), 101st Cong., 2d sess. We held hearings again in 
1994. ``The Sunshine in Litigation Act,'' hearings before the 
Subcommittee, on Courts and Administrative Practice, Committee 
on the Judiciary (Apr. 20, 1994), 103d Cong., 2d sess.
    In 1990, Arthur Bryant, the executive director of Trial 
Lawyers for Public Justice, told us: ``The one thing we learned 
* * * is that this problem is far more egregious than we ever 
imagined. It goes the length and depth of this country, and the 
frank truth is that much of civil litigation in this country is 
taking place in secret.'' 1990 hearings at 55. Four years 
later, attorney Gerry Spence told us about 19 cases he had been 
involved in which his clients had to sign secrecy agreements. 
They included cases involving defects in a hormonal pregnancy 
test that caused severe birth defects, a defective braking 
system of a steam roller, and an improperly manufactured tire 
rim. 1994 hearings at 43.
    Individual examples of this problem abound. For over a 
decade, Miracle Recreation, a U.S. playground equipment 
company, marketed a merry-go-round that caused serious injuries 
to scores of small children--including severed fingers and 
feet. Lawsuits brought against the manufacturer were 
confidentially settled, preventing the public and the Consumer 
Products Safety Commission from learning about the hazard. It 
took more than a decade for regulators to discover the hazard 
and for the company to recall the merry-go-round.
    There are yet more cases like these. In 1973, GM began 
marketing vehicles with dangerously placed fuel tanks that 
tended to rupture, burn, and explode on impact more frequently 
than regular tanks. Soon after these vehicles hit the American 
road, tragic accidents began occurring, and lawsuits were 
filed. More than 150 lawsuits were settled confidentially by 
GM. For years, this secrecy prevented the public from learning 
of the alleged dangers of these vehicles (6 million of which 
are still on the road). It wasn't until a trial in 1993 that 
the public began learning of the alleged dangers of GM 
sidesaddle gas tanks and the GM crash test data which appeared 
to demonstrate these dangers.
    Another case involves Fred Barbee, a Wisconsin resident 
whose wife, Carol, died because of a defective heart valve. We 
learned in the 1990 Judiciary Committee hearing from Mr. Barbee 
that in the months and years before his wife died, the valve 
manufacturer had quietly, without public knowledge, settled 
dozens of lawsuits in which the valve's defects were 
demonstrated. So when Mrs. Barbee's valve malfunctioned, she 
rushed to a health clinic in Spooner, WI, thinking, as did her 
doctors, that she was suffering from a heart attack. Ignorant 
of the evidence that her valve was defective, Mrs. Barbee was 
misdiagnosed. Mrs. Barbee was treated incorrectly and died. To 
this day, Mr. Barbee believes that but for the secret 
settlement of heart valve lawsuits, the medical community would 
have been aware of the valve defect, and his wife would be 
alive today. (1990 hearings at 5-8.)
    At the 1994 hearing, we heard from a family which we must 
call the ``Does'' because they are under a secrecy order and 
were afraid to use their own names when talking to us and to 
our committee. The Does were the victims of tragic medical 
malpractice that resulted in serious brain damage to their 
child. A friend of the Does is using the same doctor, but Mrs. 
Doe is terrified of saying anything to her friend for fear of 
violating the secrecy order that governed her lawsuit 
settlement. Mrs. Doe is afraid that if she talks, the defendant 
in her case will suspend the ongoing settlement payments that 
allow her to care for her injured child. (1994 hearings at 6-
7.)
    What sort of court system prohibits a woman from telling 
her friend that her child might be in danger? And the more 
disturbing question is this: what other secrets are currently 
held under lock and key which could be saving lives if they 
were made public?
    Having said all this, we must in fairness recognize that 
there is another side to this problem. Privacy is a cherished 
possession, and business information is an important commodity. 
For this reason, the courts must, in some cases, keep trade 
secrets and other business information confidential. The goal 
of this provision is to ensure that courts do not carelessly 
and automatically sanction secrecy when the health and safety 
of the American public is at stake. At the same time, it will 
still allow defendants to obtain secrecy orders when the need 
for privacy is significant and substantial.
    To attack the problem of excessive court secrecy is not to 
attack the business community. Most of the time, businesses 
seek protective orders for legitimate reasons. And although a 
few opponents of product liability reform may dispute that 
businesses care about public health and safety, we know that 
they do. Business people want to know about dangerous and 
defective products, and they want regulatory agencies to have 
the information necessary to protect the public.
    Those opposed to this provision argue that it make 
discovery more difficult, will decrease settlements and impose 
excessive burdens on judges. These problems are greatly 
exaggerated and do not take several points into account.
    First, this provision does not have any effect on most 
court cases, which have nothing to do with public health and 
safety. This amendment only applies to Federal courts and, 
within the Federal courts, to a small category of cases 
affecting public health and safety. In most cases, these issues 
will not be raised, and courts will not be burdened at all. A 
Judicial Conference study on the matter noted that only 5 to 10 
percent of all cases filed in Federal court involve protective 
orders. Of those, only about 10 to 20 percent involved personal 
injury. Based on these numbers, it is fair to say that only a 
small portion of all cases in Federal courts will require close 
scrutiny from judges.
    Second, this amendment does not prohibit confidentiality: 
it allows for secrecy in cases affecting public health and 
safety where the need for it is substantial. Moreover, it does 
not require that every document produced as a result of the 
litigation be made public. Not all of the litigation documents 
directly involve health and safety--and those documents can 
still be sealed.
    Third, a little extra work from judges seems a tiny price 
to pay for protecting blameless people from dangers. Every day, 
in the course of litigation, judges make tough calls about how 
to construe the public interest and other laws that Congress 
passes. We are confident that the courts will administer this 
law fairly and sensibly. After all, under the current version 
of rule 26(c) courts are required to determine whether there is 
``good cause'' to enter a protective order. If judges can 
determine what is good cause, they can determine what 
constitutes ``public health and safety.'' If this requires 
extra work, then the work is well worth it. After all, no one 
argues that spoiled meat should be let out on the market 
because stricter regulations mean more work for FDA meat 
inspectors.
    Finally, some may argue civil disputes are fundamentally 
private. The civil judicial system, according to this view, is 
an exclusive, private system--devoid of public interest 
considerations. But this view ignores the fact that the courts 
are fundamentally public institutions, funded by hundreds of 
millions of tax dollars. A protective order issued by a Federal 
judge is an exertion of governmental power. That power should 
not be at the disposal of private parties at their whim. Public 
institutions cannot afford cannot afford to ignore the public 
interest in dispensing justice.
    Abner Mikva, then chief judge of the Federal Circuit Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia, testified in our 1994 
hearing that ``I side with Chairman Kohl in believing that 
there is an excess of court secrecy in civil litigation, and 
that it presents a serious problem for the health and safety of 
our population. That problem is to important to leave to the 
rule changers.''
    The Committee would be satisfied to see this issue 
addressed by judges themselves. But since we first held hearing 
on court secrecy in 1990, the judges have remained essentially 
inert.\1\ Indeed, before the Committee voted on this provision, 
we received a letter from the Judicial Conference telling us 
that it was continuing its study of this issue. The letter 
ironically noted ironically noted that ``the task will be a 
long one.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ In fact, last year we worked with a number of Federal judges to 
prevent rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, dealing with 
protective orders, from becoming even worse.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, we need to deal with this problem sooner 
rather than later. That is why I am pleased that a substantial 
majority of the Committee supported my amendment.

    (a) The * * *
          * * * * * * *
    (f)(1) In order to continue receiving the salary of the 
office under subsection (b), a justice must be certified in 
each calendar year by the Chief Justice, and a judge must be 
certified by the chief judge of the circuit in which the judge 
sits, as having met the requirements set forth in at least one 
of the following subparagraphs:
          * * * * * * *
          (D) The justice or judge has, in the preceding 
        calendar year, performed substantial administrative 
        duties directly related to the operation of the courts, 
        or has performed substantial duties for a Federal or 
        State governmental entity. A certification under this 
        subparagraph shall specify that the work done is equal 
        to the full-time work of an employee of the judicial 
        branch. In any year in which a justice or judge 
        performs work described under this subparagraph for 
        less than the full year, one-half of such work may be 
        aggregated with work described under subparagraph (A), 
        (B), or (C) of this paragraph for the purpose of the 
        justice or judge satisfying the requirements of such 
        subparagraph.
          * * * * * * *
    (3) If in any year a justice or judge who retires under 
subsection (b) does not receive a certification under this 
subsection (except as provided in paragraph (1)(E)), he or she 
[is thereafter ineligible to receive such a certification.] may 
thereafter receive a certification for that year by satisfying 
the requirements of subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of 
paragraph (1) of this subsection in a subsequent year and 
attributing a sufficient part of the work performed in such 
subsequent year to the earlier year so that the work so 
attributed, when added to the work performed during such 
earlier year, satisfies the requirements for certification for 
that year. However, a justice or judge may not receive credit 
for the same work for purposes of certification for more than 1 
year.

agree to having deducted and withheld from his or her salary, a 
sum equal to 2.2 percent of that salary, and a sum equal to 3.5 
percent of his or her retirement salary. The deduction from any 
retirement salary--

        willing and able to perform judicial duties in 
        accordance with section 294 of this title,
          [(C) of a judge of the United States Court of Federal 
        Claims retired under section 178(a) or (b) of this

        the United States.]

        own motion, or under extraordinary circumstances shown 
        by any party, vacate a reference of a civil matter to a

        of the Judicial Conference, determine whether the 
        record taken pursuant to this section shall be taken by 
        electronic sound recording, by a court reporter, or by 
        other means.
    (d) The practice and procedure for the trial of cases

temporarily assigned until an order has been issued by the 
chief judge of such district specifying (1) the emergency by 
reason of which he has been transferred, (2) the duration of 
his assignment, and (3) the duties which he is authorized to 
perform. A magistrate so assigned shall not be entitled to

Sec. 1659. Protective orders and sealing of cases and settlements 
                    relating to public health or safety

    (a)(1) A court shall enter an order under rule 26(c) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure restricting the disclosure of 
information obtained through discovery or an order restricting 
access to court records in a civil case only after making 
particularized findings of fact that--
          (A) such order would not restrict the disclosure of 
        information which is relevant to the protection of 
        public health or safety; or
          (B)(i) the public interest in disclosure of potential 
        health or safety hazards is clearly outweighed by a 
        specific and substantial interest in maintaining the 
        confidentiality of the information or records in 
        question; and
          (ii) the requested protective order is no broader 
        than necessary to protect the privacy interest 
        asserted.
    (2) No order entered in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (1) shall continue in effect after the entry of final 
judgment, unless at or after such entry the court makes a 
separate particularized finding of fact that the requirements 
of paragraph (1) (A) or (B) have been met.
    (b) The party who is the proponent for the entry of an 
order, as provided under this section, shall have the burden of 
proof in obtaining such an order.
    (c)(1) No agreement between or among parties in a civil 
action filed in a court of the United States may contain a 
provision that prohibits or otherwise restricts a party from 
disclosing any information relevant to such civil action to any 
Federal or State agency with authority to enforce laws 
regulating an activity relating to such information.
    (2) Any disclosure of information to a Federal or State 
agency as described under paragraph (1) shall be confidential 
to the extent provided by law.

    (b) Special Court.--
          (1) Within 30 days after January 2, 1974, the 
        Association shall make application to the judicial 
        panel on multi-district litigation authorized by 
        section 1407 of title 28 for the consolidation in a 
        single, three-judge district court of the United States 
        of all judicial proceedings with respect to the final 
        system plan. Within 30 days after such application is 
        received, the panel shall make the consolidation in a 
        district court (cited herein as the ``special court'') 
        which the panel determines to be convenient to the 
        parties and the one most likely to be able to conduct 
        any proceedings under this section with the least delay 
        and the greatest possible fairness and ability. Such 
        proceedings shall be conducted by the special court 
        which shall be composed of three Federal judges who 
        shall be selected by the panel, except that none of the 
        judges selected may be a judge assigned to a proceeding 
        involving any railroad in reorganization in the region 
        under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act. The special 
        court is authorized to exercise the powers of a 
        district judge in any judicial district with respect to 
        such proceedings and such powers shall include those of 
        a reorganization court. The special court shall have 
        the power to order the conveyance of rail properties of 
        railroads leased, operated, or controlled by a railroad 
        in reorganization in the region. The special court may 
        issue rules for the conduct of any proceedings under 
        this section and under section 745 of this title, 
        including rules with respect to the time within which 
        motions may be filed, and with respect to appropriate 
        representation of interests not otherwise represented 
        (including the Secretary with respect to a petition by 
        the Association in the case of a proposal developed by 
        the Secretary, under such section 745 of this title). 
        No determination by the panel under this subsection may 
        be reviewed in any court.
          (2) The special court referred to in paragraph (1) of 
        this subsection is abolished effective 90 days after 
        the date of enactment of the Federal Courts Improvement 
        Act of 1996. On such effective date, all jurisdiction 
        and other functions of the special court shall be 
        assumed by the United States District Court for the 
        District of Columbia. With respect to any proceedings 
        that arise or continue after the date on which the 
        especial court is abolished, the references in the 
        following provisions to the special court established 
        under this subsection shall be deemed to refer to the 
        United States District Court for the District of 
        Columbia:
