                with the Commission or any national securities 
                organization registered under section 15A of 
                the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except 
                that this subparagraph does not apply to the 
                laws, rules, regulations, or orders, or other 
                administrative actions of the State of 
                incorporation of the issuer; or

the following are covered securities:

        such security is--
                    ``(A) listed, or authorized for listing, on 
                the New York Stock Exchange or the American 
                Stock Exchange, or listed on the National 
                Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or 
                any successor to such entities);
                    ``(B) listed, or authorized for listing, on 
                a national securities exchange (or tier or 
                segment thereof) that has listing standards 
                that the Commission determines by rule (on its 
                own initiative or on the basis of a petition) 
                are substantially similar to the listing 
                standards applicable to securities described in 
                subparagraph (A); or

                is equal in seniority or that is a senior 
                security to a security described in 
                subparagraph (A) or (B).
            ``(2) Exclusive federal registration of investment 
        companies.--A security is a covered security if such 
        security is a security issued by an investment company 
        that is registered, or that has filed a registration 
        statement, under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
            ``(3) Sales to qualified purchasers.--A security is 
        a covered security with respect to the offer or sale of 
        the security to qualified purchasers, as defined by the 
        Commission by rule. In prescribing such rule, the 
        Commission may define the term `qualified purchaser' 
        differently with respect to different categories of 
        securities, consistent with the public interest and the 
        protection of investors.

        offerings.--A security is a covered security with 
        respect to a transaction that is exempt from

                and the issuer of such security files reports 
                with the Commission pursuant to section 13 or 
                15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;

                registration pursuant to paragraph (4) or (11) 
                of such section, except that a municipal 
                security that is exempt from such registration 
                pursuant to paragraph (2) of such section is 
                not a covered security with respect to the 
                offer or sale of such security in the State in 
                which the issuer of such security is located; 
                or
                    ``(D) Commission rules or regulations 
                issued under section 4(2), except that this 
                subparagraph does not prohibit a State from 
                imposing notice filing requirements that are 
                substantially similar to those required by rule 
                or regulation under section 4(2) that are in 
                effect on September 1, 1996.

            ``(1) Fraud authority.--Consistent with this 
        section, the securities commission (or any agency or 
        office performing like functions) of any State shall 
        retain jurisdiction under the laws of such State to 
        investigate and bring enforcement actions with respect 
        to fraud or deceit, or unlawful conduct by a broker or 
        dealer, in connection with securities or securities 
        transactions.

                like functions) of any State from requiring the 
                filing of any document filed with the

                `prospectus' in section 2(10), but without 
                regard to the provisions of subparagraphs (A) 
                and (B) of that section; and
                    ``(B) includes a communication that is not

                of the Commission.

        later than 6 months after the date of enactment of the 
        Securities Amendments Act of 1996, the Commission

        behalf of the issuer' for purposes of this section.
            ``(3) State.--The term `State' has the same meaning 
        as in section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
            ``(4) Senior security.--For purposes of this

        class as to distribution of assets or payment of 
        dividends.''.
    (b) Study and Report on Uniformity.--The Commission shall 
conduct a study, after consultation with States, issuers, 
brokers, and dealers, on the extent to which uniformity of 
State regulatory requirements for securities or securities 
transactions has been achieved for securities that are not 
covered securities (within the meaning of section 18 of the 
Securities Act of 1933, as amended by paragraph (1) of this 
subsection). Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Commission shall submit a report to the 
Congress on the results of such study.

SEC. 103. BROKER-DEALER EXEMPTIONS FROM STATE LAW.

    (a) In General.--Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(h) Limitations on State Law.--
            ``(1) Capital, margin, books and records, bonding, 
        and reports.--No law, rule, regulation, or order, or 
        other administrative action of any State or political 
        subdivision thereof shall establish capital, custody, 
        margin, financial responsibility, making and keeping 
        records, bonding, or financial or operational reporting 
        requirements for brokers, dealers, municipal securities 
        dealers, government securities brokers, or government 
        securities dealers that differ from, or are in addition 
        to, the requirements in those areas established under 
        this title. The Commission shall consult periodically 
        the securities commissions (or any agency or office 
        performing like functions) of the States concerning the 
        adequacy of such requirements as established under this 
        title.
            ``(2) De minimis transactions by associated 
        persons.--No law, rule, regulation, or order, or other 
        administrative action of any State or political 
        subdivision thereof may prohibit an associated person 
        of a broker or dealer from affecting a transaction

SEC. 509. PROMOTING GLOBAL PREEMINENCE OF AMERICAN SECURITIES MARKETS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the United States and foreign securities 
        markets are increasingly becoming international 
        securities markets, as issuers and investors seek the 
        benefits of new capital and secondary market 
        opportunities without regard to national borders;
            (2) as issuers seek to raise capital across 
        national borders, they confront differing accounting 
        requirements in the various regulatory jurisdictions;
            (3) the establishment of a high-quality 
        comprehensive set of generally accepted international 
        accounting standards in cross-border securities 
        offerings would greatly facilitate international 
        financing activities and, most significantly, would 
        enhance the ability of foreign corporations to access 
        and list in United States markets;
            (4) in addition to the efforts made before the date 
        of enactment of this Act by the Commission to respond 
        to the growing internationalization of securities 
        markets, the Commission should enhance its vigorous 
        support for the development of high-quality 
        international accounting standards as soon as 
        practicable; and
            (5) the Commission, in view of its clear authority 
        under law to facilitate the access of foreign 
        corporations to list their securities in United States 
        markets, should report to the Congress, not later than 
        1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, on 
        progress in the development of international accounting 
        standards and the outlook for successful completion of 
        a set of international standards that would be 
        acceptable to the Commission for offerings and listings 
        by foreign corporations in United States markets.

SEC. 510. STUDIES AND REPORTS.

    (a) Impact of Technological Advances.--
            (1) Study.--

                            (i) the impact of technological 
                        advances and the use of on-line 
                        information systems on the securities 
                        markets, including steps that the 
                        Commission has taken to facilitate the 
                        electronic delivery of prospectuses to 
                        institutional and other investors;
                            (ii) how such technologies have 
                        changed the way in which the securities 
                        markets operate; and
                            (iii) any steps taken by the 
                        Commission to address such changes.
                    (B) Considerations.--In conducting the 
                study under subparagraph (A), the Commission 
                shall consider how the Commission has adapted 
                its enforcement policies and practices in 
                response to technological developments with 
                regard to--
                            (i) disclosure, prospectus 
                        delivery, and other customer protection 
                        regulations;
                            (ii) intermediaries and exchanges 
                        in the domestic and international 
                        financial services industry;
                            (iii) reporting by issuers, 
                        including communications with holders 
                        of securities;
                            (iv) the relationship of the 
                        Commission with other national 
                        regulatory authorities and 
                        organizations to improve coordination 
                        and cooperation; and
                            (v) the relationship of the 
                        Commission with State regulatory 
                        authorities and organizations to 
                        improve coordination and cooperation.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date 
        of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit a 
        report to the Congress on the results of the study 
        conducted under paragraph (1).
    (b) Shareholder Proposals.--
            (1) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study 
        of--
                    (A) whether shareholder access to proxy 
                statements pursuant to section 14 of the 
                Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been 
                impaired by recent statutory, judicial, or 
                regulatory changes; and
                    (B) the ability of shareholders to have 
                proposals relating to corporate practices and 
                social issues included as part of proxy 
                statements.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date

        report to the Congress on the results of the study 
        conducted under paragraph (1), together with any 
        recommendations for regulatory or legislative changes 
        that it considers necessary to improve shareholder 
        access to proxy statements.
    (c) Preferencing.--
            (1) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study of 
        the impact on investors and the national market system 
        of the practice known as ``preferencing'' on one or 
        more registered securities exchanges, including 
        consideration of--
                    (A) how preferencing impacts--
                            (i) the execution prices received 
                        by retail securities customers whose 
                        orders are preferenced; and
                            (ii) the ability of retail 
                        securities customers in all markets to 
                        obtain executions of their limit orders 
                        in preferenced securities; and
                    (B) the costs of preferencing to such

        conducted under paragraph (1).
            (3) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, 
        the term ``preferencing'' refers to the practice of a 
        broker acting as a dealer on a national securities 
        exchange, directing the orders of customers to buy or 
        sell securities to itself for execution under rules 
        that permit the broker to take priority in execution 
        over same-priced orders or quotations entered prior in 
        time.
    (d) Broker-Dealer Uniformity.--
            (1) Study.--The Commission, after consultation with 
        registered securities associations, national securities 
        exchanges, and States, shall conduct a study of the 
        impact of disparate State licensing requirements on 
        associated persons of registered brokers or dealers and 
        methods for States to attain uniform licensing 
        requirements for such persons.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date 
        of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit 
        to the Congress a report on the study conducted under 
        paragraph (1). Such report shall include 
        recommendations concerning appropriate methods 
        described in paragraph (1)(B), including any necessary 
        legislative changes to implement such recommendations.
      And the Senate agree to the same.

                                Managers on the Part of the Senate.
       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3005) to amend 
the Federal securities laws in order to promote efficiency and 
capital formation in the financial markets, and to amend the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 to promote more efficient 
management of mutual funds, protect investors, and provide more 
effective and less burdensome regulation, submit the following 
joint statement to the House and the Senate in explanation of 
the effect of the action agreed upon by the managers and 
recommended in the accompanying conference report:
      The Senate amendment struck all of the House bill after 
the enacting clause and inserted a substitute text.
      The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the Senate with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
House bill and the Senate amendment. The differences between 
the House bill, the Senate amendment, and the substitute agreed 
to in conference are noted below, except for clerical 
corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements 
reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clerical 
changes.
      The Managers agreed to the following resolution of issues 
between the House and Senate bills.
      The development and growth of the nation's capital 
markets has prompted the Congress to examine the need for 
legislation modernizing and rationalizing our scheme of 
securities regulation to promote investment, decrease the cost 
of capital, and encourage competition. The Managers have sought 
to achieve these goals while also advancing the historic 
commitment of the securities laws to promoting the protection 
of investors. In particular, the system of dual Federal and 
state securities regulation has resulted in a degree of 
duplicative and unnecessary regulation. Securities offerings 
and the brokers and dealers engaged in securities transactions 
are all currently subject to a dual system of regulation that, 
in many instances, is redundant, costly, and ineffective.
      During the course of consideration of this legislation, 
the Congress received testimony indicating that this 
duplicative regulation tends to raise the cost of capital to 
American issuers of securities without providing commensurate 
protection to investors or to our markets. Testimony also 
indicated that technological change has transformed the capital 
raising process, necessitating changes in the regulatory scheme 
to facilitate the flow of information to potential investors 
and reduce the marginal cost of capital to firms. The Managers 
have sought to eliminate duplicative and unnecessary regulatory 
burdens while preserving important investor protections by 
reallocating responsibility over the regulation of the nation's 
securities markets in a more logical fashion between the 
Federal government and the states.
      With respect to securities offerings, the Managers have 
allocated regulatory responsibility between the Federal and 
state governments based on the nature of the securities 
offering. Some securities offerings, such as those made by 
investment companies, and certain private placements are 
inherently national in nature, and are therefore subject to 
only Federal regulation. Smaller, regional, and intrastate 
securities offerings remain subject to state regulation. The 
Managers have preserved the authority of the states to protect 
investors through application of state antifraud laws. This 
preservation of authority is intended to permit state 
securities regulators to continue to exercise their police 
power to prevent fraud and broker-dealer sales practice abuses, 
such as churning accounts or misleading customers. It does not 
preserve the authority of state securities regulators to 
regulate the securities registration and offering process 
through commenting on and/or imposing requirements on the 
contents of prospectuses or other offering documents, whether 
prior to their use in a state or after such use. The Conference 
Report requires the SEC to conduct a study on the lack of 
uniformity in state regulation of non-covered securities. Such 
study shall focus on the effect of such uniformity or lack 
thereof on the cost of capital, innovation and technological 
development in securities markets, and duplicative regulation 
with respect to securities issuers, including small business.
      The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 
eliminates burdens and enhances innovation and efficiency for 
investment companies. Among these changes are provisions to 
facilitate the creation of funds, including funds of funds 
comprising unit investment trusts, to facilitate and streamline 
the registration process for investment companies, and improve 
the efficiency and usefulness of investment company 
advertising. In addition, the legislation grants the Securities 
and Exchange Commission additional authority regarding 
investment company books and records, and the preparation of 
shareholder reports. This authority is limited, however, and 
permits the Commission only to examine records that the 
Commission requires investment companies to maintain for 
inspection. The legislation does not grant the Commission 
authority to inspect any other documents that an investment 
company may maintain.
      The Managers agreed to include amendments to the 
Securities Act of 1933, and the Securities and Exchange Act of 
1934 to eliminate duplication, promote efficiency and protect 
investors.
      The Managers agreed to include amendments to the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 to eliminate duplication, 
promote efficiency and protect investors.
      The Managers agreed to include reauthorization of the SEC 
to reauthorize the Commission, and to reduce over time the fees 
collected by the agency. It is the intent of the Managers that 
at the end of the applicable ten year period, the SEC collect 
in fees a sum approximately equal to the cost of running the 
agency.
      The Managers agreed to include certain amendments to the 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to eliminate duplication, 
promote efficiency, and protect investors.
