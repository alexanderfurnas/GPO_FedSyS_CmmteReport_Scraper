divided between the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
Economic and Education Opportunities Committee. The rule 
further makes in order for the purpose of amendment an 
amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text 
of H.R. 3898. The rule waives points of order against the 
amendment in the nature of a substitute for failure to comply 
with clause 7 of rule XVI (relating to germaneness).
    The rule also provides for the consideration of the 
amendments printed in this report on the rule only in the order 
specified; if offered by the Member designated in the report; 
debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided 
and controlled by the proponent and an opponent; and which 
shall not be subject to amendment or a division of the question 
in the House or the Committee on the Whole. All points of order 
against the amendments printed in the report are waived. The 
rule also authorizes the Chair to postpone and cluster votes on 
amendments.
    Finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit, with 
or without instructions.

the Nation's linguistic resources by encouraging all residents 
to learn or maintain skills in a language other than English;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``English Plus Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
          (1) English is the primary language of the United 
        States, and all members of the society recognize the 
        importance of English to national life and individual 
        accomplishment.
          (2) Many residents of the United States speak native 
        languages other than English, including many languages 
        indigenous to this country, and these linguistic 
        resources need to be conserved and developed.
          (3) This Nation was founded on a commitment to 
        democratic principles, and not on racial, ethnic, or 
        religious homogeneity, and has drawn strength from a 
        diversity of languages and cultures and from a respect 
        for individual liberties.
          (4) Multilingualism, or the ability to speak 
        languages in addition to English, is a tremendous 
        resource to the United States because such ability 
        enhances American competitiveness in global markets by 
        permitting improved communication and cross-cultural 
        understanding between producers and suppliers, vendors 
        and clients, and retailers and consumers.
          (5) Multilingualism improves United States diplomatic 
        efforts by fostering enhanced communication and greater 
        understanding between nations.
          (6) Multilingualism has historically been an 
        essential element of national security, including the 
        use of Native American languages in the development of 
        coded communications during World War II, the Korean 
        War, and the Vietnam War.
          (7) Multilingualism promotes greater cross-cultural 
        understanding between different racial and ethnic 
        groups in the United States.
          (8) There is no threat to the status of English in 
        the United States, a language that is spoken by 97 
        percent of United States residents, according to the 
        1990 United States Census, and there is no need to 
        designate any official United States language or to 
        adopt similar restrictionist legislation.
          (9) ``English-only'' measures, or proposals to 
        designate English as the sole official language of the 
        United States, would violate traditions of cultural 
        pluralism, divide communities along ethnic lines, 
        jeopardize the provision of law enforcement, public 
        health, education, and other vital services to those 
        whose English is limited, impair government efficiency, 
        and undercut the national interest by hindering the 
        development of language skills needed to enhance 
        international competitiveness and conduct diplomacy.
          (10) Such ``English-only'' measures would represent 
        an unwarranted Federal regulation of self-expression, 
        abrogate constitutional rights to freedom of expression 
        and equal protection of the laws, violate international 
        human rights treaties to which the United States is a 
        signatory, and contradict the spirit of the 1923 
        Supreme Court case Meyer v. Nebraska, wherein the Court 
        declared that ``The protection of the Constitution 
        extends to all; to those who speak languages as well as 
        to those born with English on the tongue.''.

SEC. 3. GOVERNMENT POLICIES.

    The United States Government should pursue policies that 
promote English as the common language of the United States and 
that--
          (1) encourage all residents of this country to become 
        fully proficient in English by expanding educational 
        opportunities and informational resources;
          (2) conserve and develop the Nation's linguistic 
        resources by encouraging all residents of this country 
        to learn or maintain skills in a language other then 
        English;
          (3) respect the treaties with and the customs of 
        Native Americans, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians, 
        and other peoples indigenous to the United States and 
        its territories;
          (4) continue to provide services in languages other 
        than English as needed to facilitate access to 
        essential functions of government, promote public 
        health and safety, ensure due process, promote equal 
        educational opportunity, and protect fundamental 
        rights; and
          (5) recognize the importance of multilingualism to 
        vital American interests and individual rights, and 
        oppose restrictionist language measures.
