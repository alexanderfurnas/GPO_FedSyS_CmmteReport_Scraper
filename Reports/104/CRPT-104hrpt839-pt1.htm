  For purposes of this Act--
          (1) the term ``Organization'' means the United States 
        National Tourism Organization established under section 2; and
          (2) the term ``Board'' means the United States National 
        Tourism Organization Board established under section 3.

                          Purpose and Summary

    H.R. 2579, as reported, will establish a United States 
National Tourism Organization (USNTO) as a privately-funded, 
non-profit, non-Federal organization. The USNTO will be 
governed by a broad cross-section of the American travel and 
tourism industry, and will work to (1) promote the United 
States' share of the international travel and tourism market; 
(2) develop and implement a national travel and tourism 
strategy; (3) advise the President and Congress on how to 
implement this strategy and on other critical matters affecting 
the travel and tourism industry; (4) conduct travel and tourism 
market research; and (5) promote the interests of the United 
States travel and tourism industry at international trade 
shows. Federal agencies which conduct activities relating to 
international travel and tourism are required to give priority 
consideration to USNTO's recommendations and to report to 
Congress on any travel and tourism activities carried out with 
the participation of the United States Federal government. The 
authorization for the United States Travel and Tourism 
Administration (USTTA) is repealed, with the travel and 
tourism-related responsibilities of the Secretary of the 
Department of Commerce revised to be more narrowly focused on 
only those functions which the private sector is unable to 
implement effectively.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

    International travel and tourism is a multi-billion dollar 
industry in the United States. According to the Department of 
Commerce, inbound international tourism is our largest business 
services export, contributing towards a $22 billion 1994 
surplus in America's international travel account. The tourism 
industry, including local tourism, is the nation's second 
largest employer, and ranks third in retail sales at $417 
billion.
    Unfortunately, recent Federal tourism promotion efforts 
have failed to stem the rapid erosion of our country's 
international tourism market share. In 1993, the United States 
Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) in the Department of 
Commerce received $19.2 million to increase Federal efforts to 
promote international travel and tourism. For 1994, Congress 
appropriated another $21.5 million to further the USTTA's 
activities. Despite this infusion of Federal resources, the 
United States share of worldwide travel receipts actually 
dropped over the past three years, from a peak of 19.3 percent 
in 1992 down to 15.7 percent by the end of 1994. The United 
States has now fallen to only the third leading international 
destination, with its share of total global arrivals plummeting 
well over 8 percent. In part because of the failure of the 
USTTA to significantly positively impact America's 
international travel and tourism interests, Congress this year 
chose to discontinue USTTA's funding, effectively shutting the 
agency down.
    To preserve American interests and reverse this precipitous 
decline, the United States needs a new system for developing 
and implementing tourism policy and promotion. H.R. 2579, as 
amended, would form a new framework for the wide variety of 
businesses that compose the travel and tourism industry that 
will enable them to work together to maintain and enhance the 
United States share of the world market. It creates a 
Federally-chartered private tourism organization to promote and 
coordinate international travel and tourism to the United 
States. In so doing, it also will effectively transfer to the 
private sector the mantle of national tourism policy leadership 
from the recently dismantled and now defunct United States 
Travel and Tourism Administration.

                                Hearings

    On January 24, 1996, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, 
and Hazardous Materials held a joint hearing on H.R. 2579 with

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(D) of Rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, no oversight findings have been 
submitted to the Committee by the Committee on Government 
Reform and Oversight.

               New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(B) of Rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee states 
that H.R. 2579 would result in no new or increased budget 
authority or tax expenditures or revenues.

                        Committee Cost Estimate

    In compliance with clause 7(a) of Rule XIII of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the Committee believes that 
enactment of H.R. 2579 would result in minimal additional costs 
to the Federal government. The Committee further adopts as its 
own, with the reservations described below, the cost estimate 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
(CBO) pursuant to section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act 
of 1974.
    The revisions made by the Committee to the International 
Travel Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2122-2129) narrow, not expand, 
the existing duties of the Secretary of the Department of 
Commerce, to focus on the remaining tourism promotion 
activities still being carried out by the Department. The 
Committee notes that the specifically authorized activities 
would actually be decreased by this legislation, resulting in 
no additional costs beyond current authorization levels.

                  Congressional Budget Office Estimate

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(C) of Rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the following is the cost 
estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant 
to section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                    Washington, DC, August 1, 1996.
Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.,
Chairman, Committee on Commerce,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 2579, the United States National Tourism 
Organization Act of 1996, as ordered reported by the House 
Committee on Commerce on July 24, 1996. Assuming the 
appropriation of the necessary amounts, we estimate that 
enacting this bill could result in increased discretionary 
spending of about $2 million per year for fiscal years 1997 and 
1998, and between $3 million and $5 million per year 
thereafter. Enacting H.R. 2579 would affect direct spending and 
receipts; hence, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to the 
bill. However, CBO estimates that there would be no net impact 
on direct spending over time, and that the effect on receipts 
would be insignificant.
    Bill purpose: This bill would change the statutory basis of 
the travel and tourism programs administered by the Department 
of Commerce (DOC) and would establish a United States National 
Tourism Organization (USNTO) as a not-for-profit organization 
chartered by the federal government. The USNTO would be 
authorized to undertake a wide range of activities to promote 
tourism under the guidance of a National Tourism Organization 
Board. Although the USNTO would be a nongovernmental entity, 
the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade would 
serve as an ex-officio member of the board.
    H.R. 2579 would repeal the existing authorization for most 
of DOC's tourism activities and replace it with new statutory 
requirements. Under this measure, the department would be 
required to perform certain tasks not being done by the USNTO, 
states, or private sector, primarily in areas related to data 
collection, statistical modeling, official representation, and 
easing barriers to international travel and tourism. The bill 
also would direct the Department of State, the United States 
Information Agency (USIA), the United States Trade 
Representative, the Trade and Development Agency (TDA), and DOC 
to cooperate with the USNTO and give priority consideration to 
its recommendations. These and other federal agencies would be 
required to report to the Congress on their activities every 
two years. Finally, the bill would repeal DOC's authority to 
impose certain fees on commercial airlines and passenger cruise 
ship companies and to levy civil penalties for noncompliance.
    Impact on spending subject to appropriation: Based on 
information provided by the Department of Commerce, CBO 
estimates that DOC would spend about $2 million annually to 
develop and implement the kinds of programs outlined in this 
bill, assuming the appropriation of the necessary amounts. This 
is equivalent to the amount budgeted for fiscal year 1996 for 
the activities authorized under current law.
    The bill also would authorize certain agencies to devote 
resources to coordinating with the USNTO and giving priority 
consideration to the organization's recommendations. The extent 
of such agency efforts would depend on the nature of the 
USNTO's proposals, but could range from limited staff liaison 
to new program initiatives. For example, if the USNTO proposed 
initiatives similar to those recommended by the 1995 White 
House Commission on Travel and Tourism, we estimate that the 
USIA could spend between $1 million and $3 million annually to 
implement those proposals, assuming the appropriation of the 
necessary amounts. Any costs resulting from USNTO's 
recommendations to federal agencies would probably not be 
incurred until fiscal year 1999 because of the time needed by 
the USNTO to develop proposals and by the agencies and the 
Congress to consider them.
    We estimate that other provisions of the bill would have no 
significant impact on discretionary spending.
    Impact on direct spending and revenues: Authorizing the 
Department of State to assign priority to USNTO proposals could 
affect direct spending because recommendations for new 
initiatives probably would pertain to border security and 
visas, which are financed by fees charged for machine-readable 
visas. CBO estimates that enacting this bill would have no net 
impact on direct spending by the department over time, because 
it would not change the amount of collections or the 
expenditure of those collections.
    Repealing DOC's authority to impose fees and related civil 
penalties on commercial airlines and cruise companies could 
affect offsetting receipts and revenues, but we estimate that 
any impact would not be significant, because the department has 
never imposed such fees.
    Mandates statement: H.R. 2579 contains no intergovernment 
or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) and would not impose 
costs on the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. 
The bill would eliminate the authorization for assistance to 
state and local governments for tourism marketing activities. 
However, these activities are not mandated, and all funding for 
the Travel and Tourism Administration, which administered the 
programs, was eliminated on December 31, 1995.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Kathleen 
Gramp (for federal costs), and Leo Lex (for the state and local 
impact).
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee finds that the bill 
would have no inflationary impact.

             Section-by-Section Analysis of the Legislation

                         Section 1. Short Title

    The title of the Act is the ``United States National 
Tourism Organization Act of 1996.''

         Section 2. United States National Tourism Organization

    Section 2 establishes the United States National Tourism 
Organization (USNTO), a private, not-for-profit, Federally-
chartered organization. The USNTO shall not be considered a 
Federal agency, and thus is not subject to Federal sunshine 
laws and similar restrictions applying solely to the Executive 
Branch. The Committee intends that the USNTO shall receive a 
501(c)(6) status designation from the Internal Revenue Service.
    The USNTO is responsible for: increasing the United States' 
share of international travel and tourism; developing and 
implementing a national travel and tourism strategy; advising 
the President and Congress on the implementation of such 
strategy; operating travel and tourism promotion programs 
overseas; conducting travel and tourism market research; and 
promoting United States travel and tourism at international 
trade shows. The Committee intends that the USNTO shall work 
with the Department of Commerce's International Trade 
Administration and United States & Foreign Commercial Service, 
and other Federal agencies, to assume many of the former roles 
of the USTTA (see Section 7 for the continued duties of the 
Secretary of Commerce).
    The USNTO may accept financial contributions on behalf of 
itself or the USNTO Board (established in Section 3), and may 
enter into litigation, contracts, or investments in its own 
name. The USNTO may also provide financial assistance to any 
organization or association in furtherance of the USNTO's 
purpose and responsibilities. It is prohibited, however, from 
promoting a political party or candidate, although it is not 
restricted from promoting an issue or specific legislation.

      Section 3. United States National Tourism Organization Board

    Section 3 establishes a USNTO Board to govern the USNTO. 
The Board includes 46 members from specified private-sector 
associations, as well as a representative from the Commerce 
Department, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. The 
Board will meet at least semi-annually, serve without 
compensation, elect a Chair, and a President (who will serve on 
the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee), and create bylaws 
for the election or appointment of future Board members and for 
the hiring of additional staff and delegation of authority. The 
Committee does not intend to restrict the Board's ability to 
choose the number of future Board members or the composition of 
the Board, or to limit the ability of the Board to establish 
additional management, supervisory, or advisory structures.
    The Board shall establish procedures for: calling meetings 
and providing notice; closing meetings where confidential 
information will be discussed; designating a place of an 
official business for receipt of process; and appointing 
liaisons to the Tourism Policy Council (a Federal coordinating 
organization chaired by the Secretary of the Department of 
Commerce). The Committee recognizes that members of the travel 
and tourism industry have already established a national 
organization, the ``USA National Tourism Organization, Inc.'' 
(USA NTO, Inc.) to promote international tourism on an interim 
basis, and it is the Committee's assumption that the USA NTO, 
Inc. shall coordinate the first Board meeting.
    The Board shall present findings to Congress at least 
biannually, and shall report to the House Committee on Commerce 
and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, within one year of its first meeting, on a plan 
for long-term funding, with a focus on contributions from the 
private sector and local and State entities. The Board may 
suspend or terminate the USNTO if sufficient private sector and 
local and State funds are not received. While this section does 
not preclude any Federal funding, the Committee intends that 
the USNTO's funding should be generated by primarily non-
Federal sources.

            Section 4. United States Government Cooperation

    Section 4 directs the Secretary of State, the Director of 
the United States Information Agency, the Secretary of 
Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Trade 
and Development Agency to give priority consideration to the 
recommendations of the USNTO and to cooperate with USNTO 
activities. While the Committee recognizes that Federal 
agencies, coordinated by the Tourism Policy Council, must 
continue to retain ultimate responsibility for determining 
Federal travel and tourism policies, the Committee intends that 
Federal agencies shall look primarily to the USNTO for 
development of a national travel and tourism strategy and work 
together with the USNTO to implement and monitor the 
effectiveness of such strategy.
    The Under Secretary for International Trade, the Assistant 
Secretary for Trade Development, the United States and Foreign 
Commercial Service, the Director of the United States 
Information Agency, the United States Trade Representative, and 
the Trade and Development Agency shall report every two years 
to the House Committee on Commerce and the Senate Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation on any travel and tourism 
activities carried out with the participation of the United 
States Federal government. The Committee intends that these 
reports include any activities of these agencies that will have 
a significant impact on the United States share of 
international travel and tourism.

           Section 5. Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee

    The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) is 
directed to give priority consideration to the recommendations 
of the USNTO, and the President of the USNTO is made a member 
of the TPCC.

 Section 6. Repeal of United States Travel and Tourism Administration 
                         and Related Provisions

    Section 6 repeals USTTA's authorizing statutes and related 
provisions, including: restrictions on the Secretary of 
Commerce's performance of travel and tourism related duties; 
directives and restrictions relating to tourism marketing 
programs; required reporting by the Secretary on tourism trade 
barriers; directives to the Secretary on facilitation of entry 
of foreign tourists; establishment of the Travel and Tourism 
Advisory Board and the Rural Tourism Development Foundation; 
and the collection of a USTTA Facilitation Fee with 
corresponding civil fines. The Committee intends to allow the 
Secretary greater discretion and flexibility in carrying out a 
more narrow focus on international travel and tourism, without 
restrictions on method or required structure.

         Section 7. Powers and Duties of Secretary of Commerce

    The tourism-related duties of the Secretary of Commerce are 
narrowed to focus on critical promotion functions which, in the 
determination of the Secretary, are not being carried out by 
the USNTO or other private sector or State entities. The 
Committee intends that the Secretary will not undertake any 
travel and tourism promotion activities which would otherwise 
be carried out by the USNTO or others, but if such activities 
are not, or would not likely be, adequately performed by the 
States and private sector, that the Secretary continue to fill 
that void.
    The Secretary is directed to develop a tourism promotion 
plan, which may include programs to: collect and publish 
international travel and tourism statistics and other marketing 
information; design, implement, and publish international 
travel and tourism forecasting models; facilitate the reduction 
or elimination of barriers to international travel and tourism; 
and work with the USNTO, the Tourism Policy Council, State 
tourism agencies, and Federal agencies, to coordinate the 
Federal implementation of a national travel and tourism policy, 
represent the United States international travel and tourism 
interests to foreign governments, and maintain United States 
participation in international travel and tourism trade shows 
and fairs until such activities can be transferred to the USNTO 
and other private sector entities.

                   Section 8. Tourism Policy Council

    The Tourism Policy Council is slimmed down for greater 
effectiveness. The Secretary of Commerce, as the Chairman of 
the Council, is encouraged to consult with, and to the extent 
the Chair deems appropriate, invite the direct participation in 
Council meetings of the USNTO liaisons, as well as 
representatives of additional Federal agencies which have 
affected interests. The Committee intends that the Secretary 
will regularly invite USNTO liaisons to Council meetings and, 
where appropriate, integrate them into the Council to the 
extent possible without compromising disclosure of non-public 
information.
    Where necessary to prevent the public disclosure of non-
public information which may be presented by a Council member, 
the Council is allowed, at the discretion of the Chairman, to 
hold a closed meeting, and may exclude any individual who is 
not a Federal officer or employee. The Committee intends that 
the Council is not required to exclude non-Federal individuals, 
such as USNTO liaisons, in order to close a meeting to the 
general public.
    Provisions requiring designation of agency alternates are 
eliminated, as well as travel reimbursement provisions, 
specification of additional Council duties, authority to force 
Council agency members to transfer staff and resources to the 
Council, and limits on the purpose of policy committees. The 
Committee intends that participating or interested Federal 
agencies may, and should, continue to transfer resources as 
necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the Council. The 
Committee further recognizes that the Council may continue to 
form policy committees, and deletion of these limiting 
provisions are only intended to allow the Council greater 
flexibility in carrying out its activities.

                         Section 9. Definitions

    Section 9 defines ``Organization'' as the USNTO, and 
``Board'' as the USNTO's Board.

  [Sec. 201. In order to carry out the national tourism policy 
established by section 101(b) the Secretary of Commerce 
(hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') 
shall--
          [(1) develop, plan, and carry out a comprehensive 
        program designed to stimulate and encourage travel to 
        the United States by residents of foreign countries for 
        the purpose of study, culture, recreation, business, 
        and other activities as a means of promoting friendly 
        understanding and good will among peoples of foreign 
        countries and of the United States;
          [(2) provide export promotion services that will 
        increase the number of States, local governments (as 
        defined in section 3371(2) of title 5, United States 
        Code), and companies in the United States that sell 
        their tourism services in the international market, 
        expand the number of foreign markets in which exporting 
        States, cities, and companies are active, and inform

        paragraph (5) of this subsection;
          [(7) may make awards of merchandise manufactured and 
        purchased in the United States to travel agents and

        residents of foreign countries; and the Secretary may 
        establish such policies, standards, criteria, and 
        procedures as he may deem necessary or appropriate for 
        the administration of this paragraph;
          [(8) shall establish facilitation services at major

        program;
          [(12) shall encourage to the maximum extent feasible

        resources of the Department are used to effectively and 
        efficiently carry out the national tourism policy;
          [(14) may only promulgate, issue, rescind, and amend 
        such interpretive rules, general statements of policy, 
        and rules of agency organization, procedure, and 
        practice as may be necessary to carry out this Act; and
          [(15) may assist the Rural Tourism Development 
        Foundation, established under section 4 of the Tourism 
        Policy and Export Promotion Act of 1992, in the 
        development and promotion of rural tourism.
  [(b) The Secretary, under the authority of this Act, shall

and the United States in competition with business engaged in 
providing or arranging for such transportation or 
accommodations.
  [(c) No financial assistance will be made available under 
section 203 unless the Secretary determines that matching funds 
will be available from State or other non-Federal sources. Any 
recipient of financial assistance under section 203 shall 
provide matching funds (consisting of actual dollar 
expenditures on the program for which such financial assistance 
is provided) equal to at least 25 percent of such financial 
assistance. The Secretary is authorized to establish such 
policies, standards, criteria, and procedures and to prescribe 
such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or 
appropriate for the administration this subsection. Each 
recipient of assistance under section 203 shall keep such 
records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records 
which fully disclose the amount and disposition by such 
recipient of the proceeds of such assistance, the total cost of 
the project or undertaking in connection with which such 
assistance is given or used, and the amount of that portion of 
the cost of the project or undertaking supplied by other 
sources, and such other records as will facilitate an effective 
audit.
  [(d) The Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United 
States, or any of their duly authorized representatives shall 
have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any 
books, documents, papers, and records of the recipients that 
are pertinent to the assistance received under section 203.
  [(e)(1) The Secretary's tourism trade development efforts 
shall focus on the markets which have the greatest potential 
for increasing travel and tourism revenues.
  [(2)  By  October  1  of  each  year  (commencing  October 1, 
1993), the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal 
Register soliciting comment, from persons interested in tourism 
trade, concerning markets that would be an appropriate focus of 
tourism trade development efforts to be carried out in the 
twelve-month period that begins twelve months after the notice 
is published.
  [(3) Not later than three months after the notice is 
published under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall select the 
markets that the Secretary determines are an appropriate focus 
of tourism trade development efforts to be carried out in the 
twelve-month period described in paragraph (2). The selection 
shall be announced by publication in the Federal Register.
  [(4) At the same time the Secretary announces the selection 
of markets under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall issue a 
request for proposals from cooperative tourism marketing

          [(2) four members shall be appointed for terms of two 
        years, as designated by the Secretary at the time of 
        appointment. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy 
        occurring before the expiration of the term for which 
        the member's predecessor was appointed shall be 
        appointed only for the remainder of such term. A member 
        may serve after the expiration of his term until his 
        successor has taken office. Vacancies on the Board 
        shall be filled in the same manner in which the 
        original appointments were made. No member of the Board 
        shall be eligible to serve in excess of six consecutive 
        years or nine years in the aggregate.
  [(c) The Chairman and Vice Chairman and other appropriate 
officers of the Board shall be elected by and from members of 
the Board other than the Secretary.
  [(d) The members of the Board shall receive no compensation 
for their services as such, but shall be allowed such necessary 
travel expenses and per diem as are authorized by section 5703 
of title 5, United States Code. The Secretary shall pay the 
reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the Board in 
connection with the coordination of Board activities, 
announcement and reporting of meetings, and preparation of such 
reports as are required by subsection (f).
  [(e) The Board shall meet at least semi-annually and shall 
hold such other meetings at the call of the Chairman, the 
Administrator, or a majority of its members.
  [(f) The Board shall advise the Secretary with respect to the 
implementation of this Act. The Board shall prepare an annual 
report concerning its activities and include therein such 
recommendations as it deems appropriate with respect to the 
performance of the Secretary under this Act and the operation 
and effectiveness of programs under this Act. Each annual 
report shall cover a fiscal year and shall be submitted on or 
before the thirty-first day of December following the close of 
the fiscal year.
  [Sec. 304. For the purpose of carrying out this Act there is 
authorized to be appropriated an amount not to exceed 
$8,600,000 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, not 
to exceed $21,000,000 for fiscal year 1993, not to exceed 
$22,500,000 for fiscal year 1994, not to exceed $24,000,000 for

the Secretary without regard to sections 501 and 3702 of title 
44, United States Code. Funds appropriated under this section 
for the printing of travel promotional materials shall remain 
available for 2 fiscal years.
  [Sec. 305. As used in this Act, the term ``United States'' 
and the term ``State'' are defined to include the District of 
Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, 
Guam, American Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific 
Islands.
  [Sec. 306. (a) To the extent not inconsistent with treaties 
or international agreements entered into by the United States, 
the Secretary, on a calendar quarterly basis beginning January 
1, 1991, shall charge and collect from each commercial airline 
and passenger cruise ship line transporting passengers to the 
United States, a United States Travel and Tourism 
Administration Facilitation Fee, in an amount determined under 
subsection (b).
  [(b)(1) During the period from January 1, 1991, through 
December 31, 1991, the Secretary shall charge each commercial 
airline and passenger cruise ship line an amount equal to one 
dollar multiplied by the number of aliens described in section 
101(a)(15)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(15)(B)) arriving at any port within the United States 
aboard a commercial aircraft or cruise ship of such airline or 
passenger cruise ship line during that calendar quarter.
  [(2) Commencing in 1991, the Secretary shall each year 
determine and publish the amount of the fee described in 
subsection (a) for the 12-month period commencing on January 1 
of the succeeding calendar year, as follows:
          [(A) The Secretary (in consultation with the Attorney 
        General and the Secretary of State) shall estimate the 
        number of aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(B) of 
        the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 succeeding 
        calendar year, based upon the number of such aliens who 
        entered the United States during the previous calendar 
        year (as reported or estimated by the Attorney General) 
        and such other available information as the Secretary 
        deems reliable.
          [(B) The Secretary shall divide the amount 
        appropriated to the United States Travel and Tourism 
        Administration for the fiscal year during which such 
        determination is made by the number of aliens described 
        in subparagraph (A) expected by the Secretary to enter 
        the United States during the calendar year described in 
        such subparagraph, as estimated by the Secretary under 
        such subparagraph, and shall round the result up to the 
        nearest quarter-dollar.
          [(C) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal 
        Register the estimate required by subparagraph (A), 
        together with a description of the information 
        supporting such estimate, and the amount of the fee 
        determined under subparagraph (B) which shall be 
        applicable during the 12-month period commencing on 
        January 1 of the succeeding calendar year.
          [(D) For each calendar quarter beginning after 
        December 31, 1991, the Secretary shall charge each 
        commercial airline and passenger cruise ship line an 
        amount equal to the fee amount determined under 
        subparagraph (B) and applicable under subparagraph (C) 
        multiplied by the number of aliens described in section 
        101(a)(15)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
        U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(B)) arriving at any port within the 
        United States aboard a commercial aircraft or cruise 
        ship of such airline or passenger cruise ship line 
        during that calendar quarter.
  [(3) Neither the estimate of the Secretary under paragraph 
(2)(A) nor the amount determined by the Secretary under 
paragraph (2)(B) shall be subject to judicial review.
  [(c) Each commercial airline and passenger cruise ship line 
shall remit the fee charged by the Secretary under subsection 
(b), in United States dollars, no later than 31 days after the 
close of the calendar quarter of the arrival of the aliens on 
which the calculation of the fee is based.
  [(d) The Secretary shall deposit the fees received pursuant 
to subsection (c) in the general fund of the Treasury as 
offsetting receipts and ascribed to the travel and tourism 
activities of the Secretary.
  [(e) Beginning on October 1, 1992, the aggregate amounts 
collected for the fee charged under this section shall at least 
equal the appropriations made for the travel and tourism 
activities of the Secretary under this Act, but at no time 
shall the aggregate of amounts collected for any fiscal year 
under this section exceed 105 percent of the aggregate of 
appropriations made for such fiscal year for activities to be 
funded by such fees.
  [(f) The Secretary may prescribe such rules and regulations 
as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this 
section.
  [Sec. 307. (a) Any commercial airline or commercial cruise 
ship line which is found by the Secretary or the Secretary's 
designee, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, to 
have failed to pay to the Secretary, by the due date, the fee 
charged by the Secretary under section 306(a), may be ordered 
by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee to pay any fee 
amount outstanding plus interest on any late payment and, in 
addition, to pay a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each 
day payment to the Secretary is not made or was made late. The 
amount of such civil penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary 
or the Secretary's designee by written notice. In determining 
the amount of such penalty, the Secretary or the Secretary's 
designee shall take into account the nature, circumstances, 
extent, and gravity of the violation, and, with respect to the 
violator, the degree of culpability, and history of prior 
offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may 
require. Each day a payment to the Secretary required by this 
Act is late shall constitute a separate violation of this Act.
  [(b) If any commercial airline or cruise ship line fails to 
pay as ordered by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee, 
the Attorney General may, upon request of the Secretary, bring 
a civil action in any appropriate United States district court 
for the recovery of the amount ordered to be paid.
  [(c) Before requesting the Attorney General to bring a civil 
action, the Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or 
without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to 
imposition or which has been imposed under subsection (a).
  [(d) For the purpose of conducting any hearing under 
subsection (a), the Secretary or the Secretary's designee may 
issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses 
and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, 
and may administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the 
same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts 
of the United States. In case of contempt or refusal to obey a 
subpoena served upon any person pursuant to this subsection, 
the United States district court for any district in which such 
person is found, resides, or transacts business, upon 
application by the United States and after notice to such 
person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring 
such person to appear and give testimony before the Secretary 
or the Secretary's designee or to appear and produce papers, 
books, and documents before the Secretary or the Secretary's 
designee, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the 
court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.]
  Sec. 301. (a) In order to ensure that the United States' 
national interest in tourism is fully considered in Federal 
decision making, there is established a coordinating council to 
be known as the Tourism Policy Council (hereafter in this Act 
referred to as the ``Council'').
  (b) The Council shall consist of the following individuals:

           DISSENTING VIEWS OF THE HONORABLE JOHN D. DINGELL

    I oppose H.R. 2579, as reported, because it is unnecessary 
legislation, because it promises more than it delivers, and 
because it is a cynical approach to addressing legitimate 
issues involving the U.S. travel and tourism industry.
    No one disputes the importance of travel and tourism to our 
economy. The industry generates billions of dollars in revenues 
and employs tens of thousands of Americans. In my home State of 
Michigan, tourism plays an important role in the State's 
economy. In fact, Governor Engler's Tourism Director asked me 
to support full funding for the U.S. Travel and Tourism 
Administration (USTTA), stating that ``[e]limination of this 
agency or reduction in its already meager budget would 
seriously reduce our ability to contribute effectively to 
lowering the U.S. trade deficit through tourism.'' (December 
19, 1994 letter from Arthur E. Ellis, Director, Michigan Travel 
Bureau).
    I was a strong critic of USTTA in the past. My criticism of 
the agency had nothing to do with the importance of promoting 
legitimate U.S. tourism interests. Instead, it derived from the 
fact that the agency could not prove it brought into the U.S. 
more than what it cost American taxpayers to fund it. In 1985, 
I tried to abolish USTTA. That effort was rejected by a fully 
bipartisan majority of the Committee. The vote was 20-22.
    I supported legislation in the 100th Congress to make USTTA 
fully funded by industry user fees, because that addressed my 
biggest concern about the agency--eliminating general taxpayer 
support for USTTA. Though the legislation was enacted (section 
10301, Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, P.L. 100-
508), it was never implemented, because some of the biggest 
beneficiaries of USTTA's programs, like the airline industry, 
alleged the bill violated provisions of an international treaty 
(see, Federal Register, Vol. 57, No. 23, February 4, 1992).
    In the 102d Congress, the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
worked to enact bipartisan legislation to reform USTTA (Tourism 
Policy and Export Promotion Act of 1992, P.L. 102-372). Based 
on the new law, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Under 
Secretary Greg Farmer succeeded in making significant reforms 
of the agency. They made USTTA more accountable. They improved 
USTTA's relationships and partnerships with State and local 
governments. They worked closely with industry to reinvent the 
agency's programs. Their commendable efforts were evident in 
last year's White House Conference on Travel and Tourism, when 
government and industry officials came together and set 
objectives for implementing a national tourism plan.
    Ironically, just as USTTA was taking important strides 
toward fulfilling its statutory responsibilities, the 
Republicans passed legislation--as part of one of their many 
continuing resolutions that followed the disastrous partial 
government shutdowns--that zeroed out USTTA's appropriation 
(H.R. 3019, Balanced Budget Down Payment Act, Part II, P.L. 
104-134; see also, H. Rpt. 104-537, 142 Cong. Rec. H4187, April 
30, 1996). This action was consistent with legislation Commerce 
Committee Republicans supported that abolished USTTA, as part 
of a larger effort to ``eliminate'' the Department of Commerce 
(see, H.R. 1756, the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, as 
reported by the Committee on Commerce; see also, Title XVII, 
H.R. 2491, Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995).
    At the same time Republicans were busy abolishing funding 
for USTTA--and as if to apologize for doing so--H.R. 2579 was 
introduced.
    H.R. 2579 is a bill in search of a reason to exist. The 
main purpose of the bill is to create the United States 
National Tourism Organization, described in this report as a 
``privately-funded, non-profit, non-Federal organization.'' But 
why do we need Federal legislation to create a private 
organization? Either there is a compelling interest justifying 
government involvement in the promotion of U.S. tourism 
interests or there is not. If there is such an interest, then 
the decision to eliminate USTTA funding should be reconsidered. 
If there is not such a compelling interest, we should leave it 
up to industry to decide if it wishes to avail itself of State 
laws governing the formation of ``privately-funded, non-profit, 
non-Federal'' organizations.
    This bill is a fig leaf that tries to cover up what 
Republicans have done to USTTA. My Republican colleagues preach 
every day how we ought to get the Federal government out of the 
way and turn matters over to the States. Yet the fact is that 
adequate laws already exist in the District of Columbia and 
every one of the 50 States governing the establishment of non-
profit corporations (see, e.g., Title 29, District of Columbia 
Code). It doesn't take Federal legislation, like H.R. 2579, to 
create a non-profit corporation to promote American tourism 
interests.
    Supporters of H.R. 2579 refer to the bill as ``ground-
breaking'' legislation that is needed more than ever in view of 
the demise of USTTA (see, e.g., 142 Cong. Rec. E630, April 25, 
1996). Nothing could be further from the truth. The bill does 
nothing that the private sector cannot do on its own. I am 
sure, however, the private sector will be back soon asking us 
to shower money or other special benefits on their new 
Congressionally-blessed corporation, all at the taxpayers' 
expense.
    Indeed, at the January 24, 1996 hearing on H.R. 2579, 
witnesses described the lack of Federal commitment to travel 
and tourism. Judson Green, President of Walt Disney 
Attractions, noted that Australia ``invests'' $20 for each 
international visitor compared to only 28 cents by the United 
States government. Jonathan Tisch, President of Loews Hotels, 
testified that ``[c]urrently, the U.S. ranks 33rd in terms of 
national tourism promotion budgets--even countries such as 
Tunisia and Malaysia spend more.'' Roger Ballou, Chief 
Marketing Officer for Alamo Rent A Car, Inc., emphasized that 
governments of other countries ``devote significant resources 
to their national tourism organization, knowing that the 
investment pays off handsomely.'' This report ignores the calls 
for greater governmental involvement in tourism promotion, as 
clearly reflected in the record before the Committee, and 
instead concludes that the ``precipitous'' decline of the 
American share of worldwide travel receipts (18.9 percent in 
1993 to 17.9 percent in 1995) somehow will be cured by H.R. 
2579. If H.R. 2579 is enacted, I will be watching anxiously to 
see if, when, and how the U.S. National Tourism Organization 
will reverse the decline of U.S. tourism cited in this report 
(if any reliable statistics are available).
    I cannot in good conscience support this bill. It amounts 
to an apology to the travel and tourism industry--what 
politicians refer to as ``cover.'' It is designed to make it 
look like the Congress is doing something worthwhile while 
trying to hide what Republicans have already done.

                                                   John D. Dingell.
