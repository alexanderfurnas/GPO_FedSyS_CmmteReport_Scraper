          (2) Sections 5 through 9 shall take effect on July 1, 1997.

                          Purpose and Summary

    H.R. 1186, as reported, is intended to improve the ability 
of State-authorized boxing commissions to provide proper 
oversight of professional boxing, and to establish minimum 
health and safety standards for professional boxers. It ensures 
that no professional boxing match may be conducted without the 
supervision of a State-authorized boxing commission. It creates 
a uniform system of registration, licensing, and reporting, 
which is regulated and managed by States and private interests. 
Procedures are outlined for mutual recognition, review, and 
appeal of boxer suspensions. Minimum safety standards are 
established with the manner and extent of such standards left 
up to the States, including a pre-fight physical exam by a 
licensed physician, a physician and an ambulance or medical 
personnel with appropriate resuscitation equipment continuously 
present at ringside, and health insurance for each boxer to 
provide medical coverage for injuries sustained during a match. 
Members and employees of boxing commissions and the Association 
of Boxing Commissions are prohibited from belonging to, 
contracting with, or receiving compensation from those who 
sanction, arrange, or promote professional boxing matches or 
who have a financial interest in a boxer. Two studies are 
authorized, one by the Secretary of Labor to determine the 
feasibility of a national pension system for boxers; the second 
by the Department of Health and Human Services (National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) to develop 
recommendations for health, safety, and equipment standards for 
boxing. The Attorney General is empowered to enforce this 
legislation, and States are authorized to adopt additional 
regulations and penalties that are not inconsistent with these 
purposes.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

    Boxing is perhaps the oldest sport in existence, dating 
back to the Sumerians in 2600 BC. The ancient Greeks introduced 
boxing to the Olympics in 688 BC, with participants required to 
wear protective headgear and leather hand-coverings. The sport 
became more violent under the Romans, with slaves forced to 
fight for their freedom wearing only iron-studded gloves. 
Organized individual fighting has since been reintroduced and 
outlawed over the years, with modern boxing rules first 
introduced in England and the United States in the late 
nineteenth century.
    Unlike many modern sports, professional boxing has no 
single set of health and safety standards for its athletes. 
Matches are organized by an uncoordinated group of private 
sanctioning bodies and promoters who are only minimally 
concerned with the rights and safety of individual boxers. 
Boxing commissions do not even exist in a handful of States, 
and many existing commissions are undermanned, underfunded, and 
fail to provide such minimum safety precautions as evaluating a 
boxer's record for suspensions or ensuring health insurance 
coverage for injuries sustained by a boxer during a match.
    Issues of fraud also continue to haunt the sport. Boxing 
titles are handed out by an ``alphabet soup'' of sanctioning 
bodies. Numerous witnesses have testified before the Committee 
that fighters are not matched on the basis of merit, but rather 
according to the interests of certain key promoters with 
significant conflicts of interests. Legitimate title contenders 
find themselves shut out of championship competition if they 
don't pay their dues and play the game accordingly.
    Many fighters are intentionally mismatched in order to 
massage the win-loss record of favored individuals. These 
mismatches can result in a greatly increased risk of injury, 
especially when conducted with inadequate medical examinations 
and supervision. For example, the Committee examined the 
records of three boxers who together have lost hundreds of 
professional fights, receiving numerous consecutive suspensions 
which were subsequently ignored as they journeyed from State to 
State in search of the next fall to the canvass. Unfortunately, 
these poorly-supervised matches result in numerous long-term 
injuries, including chronic brain injuries.

                                Hearings

    Since 1983, the Committee on Commerce has held seven 
hearings on the sport of boxing, receiving testimony on issues 
of fraud and the dangers to boxer health and safety. H.R. 1186 
marks the third time that the Committee on Commerce has 
reported legislation to the full House. The Committee on 
Economic and Educational Opportunities has held an additional 
four hearings during this period, twice reporting boxing 
legislation.
    During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee on Commerce, 
Trade, and Hazardous Materials held a joint hearing on H.R. 
1186, the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996, with the 
Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities 
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, on June 11, 1996. 
Testimony was received from the following witnesses: the 
Honorable Pat Williams; the Honorable Major R. Owens; the 
Honorable John McCain; the Honorable Richard H. Bryan; the 
Honorable Bill Richardson; Mr. Marc Ratner, President of the 
Association of Boxing Commissions and Executive Director of the 
Nevada State Athletic Commission; Mr. Gregory P. Sirb, Vice 
President of the Association of Boxing Commissions and 
Executive Director of the Pennsylvania State Athletic 
Commission; Mr. David Dick, Director, Virginia State Department 
of Professional and Occupational Regulation; Mr. Bruce 
Anderson, Director, Boxing and Wrestling Commission Section of 
the Oregon State Police; Mr. Tim Witherspoon, professional 
boxer; Mr. Tony Thornton, professional boxer; and Dr. Charles 
Wilson, M.D., Atlantic City, New Jersey.

                        Committee Consideration

    On July 18, 1996, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and 
Hazardous Materials met in open markup session and approved 
H.R. 1186, the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996, for Full 
Committee consideration, as amended, by a rollcall vote of 11 
yeas to 10 nays.
    On September 18, 1996, the Committee on Commerce met in 
open markup session and ordered H.R. 1186 reported to the 
House, as amended, by a voice vote, a quorum being present.

                             Rollcall Votes

    Clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 24, 1996.
Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.,
Chairman, Committee on Commerce,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1186, the 
Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996.
    Enacting H.R. 1186 would affect direct spending and 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to 
the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

    1. Bill number: H.R. 1186.
    2. Bill title: Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Commerce on September 18, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: H.R. 1186 would permit a professional 
boxing match to take place only if the match conformed to 
conditions outlined in the bill. Matches could only be held in 
a state with a boxing commission or under the supervision of a 
state with a boxing commission. The bill would impose various 
health and safety standards, including a requirement that a 
physician certify the boxers in a match to be physically fit. 
Each boxer would need to present an identification card issued 
by a state boxing commission before the start of the match.
    H.R. 1186 would require state boxing commissions to 
establish procedures for evaluating the professional records of 
boxers and ensuring that no boxer is permitted to box while 
under suspension from any other state boxing commission. The 
bill would direct Indian tribes to establish standards for 
boxing matches on Indian reservations Tribes also could opt to 
contract with a state boxing commission to oversee matches held 
on its reservation. The bill also would establish standards to 
prevent conflicts of interest between the organizers and 
promoters of a match and those who monitor the industry.
    The bill would permit United States Attorneys to bring 
civil actions against anyone who violates provisions of the 
bill and would establish criminal fines and penalties for 
violations. Finally, the bill would require the Secretary of 
Labor to conduct a study on a national pension plan for 
professional boxers and the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services to develop recommendations for health, safety, and 
equipment standards for boxers and boxing matches.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates 
that enacting H.R. 1186 would have no significant impact on the 
federal budget. Based on information from the Office of the 
United States Attorneys, CBO estimates that the bill would not 
result in any significant cost to the federal government for 
additional civil actions brought by United States. Based on 
information from the Department of Justice we estimate that any 
increase in collections for criminal fines would not be 
significant.
    Criminal fines would be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund 
and spent in the following year as direct spending. The 
increase in direct spending would be the same as the amount of 
fines collected, with a one-year lag. Therefore, additional 
direct spending would also be negligible.
    Based on information from the Department of Labor and the 
Department of Health and Human Service, we estimate that the 
studies required by H.R. 1186 would cost about $500,000, 
assuming appropriation of the necessary funds.
    6. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets 
up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct 
spending or receipts through 1998. Enacting H.R. 1186 would 
affect direct spending and receipts through the imposition of 
criminal fines and the resulting spending from the Crime 
Victims Fund. However, CBO estimates that the amounts involved 
would not be significant. The following table summarizes the 
estimated pay-as-you-go impact of this bill.

                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 1996     1997     1998 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change in outlays............................        0        0        0
Change in receipts...........................        0        0        0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: H.R. 1186 would impose intergovernmental mandates 
as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public 
Law 104-4), but CBO estimates that the cost of these mandates 
would not be significant and would not exceed the $50 million 
threshold established in the law. The bill would place 
requirements on states that have boxing commissions and on 
Indian tribes that hold boxing matches on their reservations.
    State boxing commissions would be required to issue 
identification cards to each professional boxer who registers 
with the commission. They would also be required to establish 
various procedures and to file reports with each boxer registry 
certified by the Association of Boxing Commissions. Although 
the bill establishes these requirements for the 45 existing 
commissions, it does not require states to establish such 
commissions. Boxers residing in a state with no boxing 
commission could register with any other state's commission. 
Promoters seeking to put on a boxing match in a state that does 
not have a boxing commission could enter into an agreement with 
another state's commission to oversee the match. Consequently, 
states without boxing commissions would not be required to 
create them to comply with this bill. According to several 
state boxing officials, many commissions are already complying 
with the requirements set out in the bill. CBO estimates that 
the costs to state commissions not already in compliance would 
thus be minimal.
    The bill would also require Indian tribes, if they chose to 
regulate professional boxing matches held on their reservation, 
to have in place health and safety standards and other 
requirements that are at least as restrictive as either the 
standards of the states in which the reservations are located 
or the guidelines of the Association of Boxing Commissions. 
Instead of meeting this requirement, tribes could opt to 
contract with a state boxing commission to oversee matches. 
Industry data indicates that about 25 professional boxing 
matches have been held annually on reservations in recent 
years, and that the cost of contracting for supervision from a 
state boxing commission ranges from $500 to $1,500 per match. 
Assuming that tribes would incur similar costs whether they 
contract out or oversee the matches themselves, CBO estimates 
that the costs of the mandate on tribes would not exceed 
$40,000 per year. Even if the number of matches held on 
reservations increases dramatically in the future, total 
compliance costs would not be significant.
    8. Estimated impact on the private sector: H.R. 1186 would 
impose mandates on the promoters of professional boxing matches 
and on boxers. CBO estimates that the cost of those mandates 
would be well below the $100 million threshold.
    This bill would require that a promoter of a professional 
boxing match in a state without a boxing commission arrange to 
have the match supervised by a boxing commission from another 
state. Further, the promoter must provide written assurances to 
the supervising boxing commission that they have complied with 
the provisions of this act. Based on industry data, in recent 
years the number of unsupervised matches in the five states 
that do not have boxing commissions ranges from one to three 
annually. The total costs of supervision range from $500 to 
$1,500 per match. Thus CBO estimates this provision would 
impose costs of between $500 and $4,500 a year on the private 
sector.
    H.R. 1186 would require promoters of a boxing match to meet 
various health and safety standards in order to hold a boxing 
match. According to representatives of the boxing industry, 
some of those standards are now being met either on a mandatory 
or voluntary basis. At most, those new requirements would 
affect approximately 80 matches annually and about 700 boxers. 
The maximum private-sector costs associated with these safety 
standards would amount to approximately $100,000 a year. CBO 
expects that some states would exclude some requirements by 
subsequent regulation as allowed under section 5(2), thus 
reducing the required costs.
    Based on information from the Association of Boxing 
Commissions, CBO estimates that each boxer would be expected to 
pay approximately $15 for a renewable identification card as 
required by the bill. Data from the industry indicates that 
there are approximately 3,000 active boxers in the United 
States. Thus, the cost of this provision is estimated to be 
about $45,000.
    9. Previous CBO estimate: On August 1, 1995, CBO provided a 
cost estimate for S. 187, the Professional Boxing Safety Act, 
as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation on July 20, 1995. The two bills are 
similar; however, H.R. 1186 would require an additional study 
by the Department of Health and Human Services. CBO estimates 
that both bills would not result in any significant impact on 
the federal budget.
    10. Estimate prepared by: Federal cost estimate: Rachel 
Forward and Stephanie Weiner. Impact on State, local, and 
tribal governments: Pepper Santalucia. Impact on the private 
sector: Jean Wooster.
    11. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant 
Director for Budget Analysis.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee finds that the bill 
would have no inflationary impact.

                      Advisory Committee Statement

    No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act are created by this 
legislation.

             Section-by-Section Analysis of the Legislation

Section 1. Short title

    Section 1 sets forth the title of the Act as the 
``Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996''.

Section 2. Definitions

    Section 2 sets forth the definitions used in the Act.
    The Committee intends that ``boxing commissions'' can be 
any entity, private or public, that is authorized under State 
law to regulate professional boxing, so long as such entity 
does not violate the conflict of interest provisions in Section 
9 of this Act.
    ``Boxer registries'' are intended by the Committee to be 
the data banks for receiving and distributing information on 
the current status of licensed boxers. The Florida State 
Athletic Commission is currently receiving and distributing 
free updates on all suspended boxers in the United States. The 
Association of Boxing Commissions currently retains Fight Fax, 
Inc. as its record keeper. The Committee intends that the 
Association of State Boxing Commissions may designate any 
reasonable number of appropriate entities which can receive and 
distribute, for a fee or free-of-charge, the information 
required to be reported under Section 8.
    The Committee recognizes that the definition of 
``physician'' may encompass authorized doctors with practice 
specialties unrelated to typical boxing injuries, and expects 
that States shall further qualify and refine what types of 
physicians are most effective at ringside.
    ``Professional boxing matches'' involve two unarmed 
individuals physically striking each other with gloved fists 
with intent to cause harm as a sport for the purpose of 
receiving financial compensation. Professional boxing is not 
intended to include amateur competitions which are governed by 
USA Boxing, such as Olympic boxing, collegiate boxing, police 
athletic leagues, Golden Gloves, Silver Gloves, Local Boxing 
Committees, and other forms of local competitions which may 
involve nominal stipends for living and training expenses for 
members, but not cash prizes for individual competitions.
    The term ``promoter'' is not intended to include entities 
such as resorts that may participate to a minor extent in 
advertising the match, or other owners or operators of a venue 
where a match is taking place, where such entities are not 
primarily responsible for promoting the particular match in 
question.

Section 3. Purposes

    The purposes of the Act are to improve professional boxing 
safety standards and to assist States and their boxing 
commissions in providing appropriate regulatory oversight of 
professional boxing.

Section 4. Boxing matches in States without boxing commissions

    States are not required to establish or authorize boxing 
commissions. A professional boxing match may be held in a State 
without a boxing commission, but only if such match is 
supervised by a boxing commission authorized in another State. 
The match is then subject to the requirements both of the State 
of the supervising commission and the most recent version of 
the recommended regulatory guidelines certified and published 
by the Association of Boxing Commissions. It is anticipated 
that the Association of Boxing Commissions shall certify and 
publish a set of such guidelines before the July 1, 1997, 
effective date of Sections 5-9 of this Act, and that such 
guidelines shall be periodically updated as appropriate.

Section 5. Safety standards

    There are four safety standards required before a 
professional boxing match may take place: (1) each boxer must 
obtain a physical examination by a physician certifying that 
the boxer is physically fit to compete safely, with copies of 
the certification provided to the boxing commission; (2) an 
ambulance or medical personnel with appropriate resuscitation 
equipment must be continuously present on site; (3) a physician 
must be present continuously at ringside; and (4) health 
insurance must be provided for each boxer to cover injuries 
sustained during a match.
    Boxing commissions are given full latitude as to the manner 
in which the standards are to be carried out, and may adopt 
alternative requirements that provide equivalent protection of 
boxers' health and safety. For example, different boxing 
commissions may develop different requirements as to which 
persons involved in a match are responsible for making any 
payments necessary to ensure that the standards are met.
    While each boxing commission is responsible for developing 
regulations to implement these standards for boxing matches 
under its supervision, all four requirements must be met for a 
match to occur. Any individual who participates in the match, 
whether as a promoter, matchmaker, or boxer, who knows that one 
of these standards is not being met is subject to criminal 
penalties as set forth in Section 10.
    With respect to the first standard, the Committee expects 
that boxing commissions and the Association of Boxing 
Commissions shall require that such examination take place 
within a certain short time period before the match, as each 
entity considers appropriate. With respect to the second 
standard (ambulance/medical personnel), boxing commissions may 
adopt different regulations if expressly promulgated subsequent 
to the enactment of this Act, as appropriate to adapt to the 
needs and abilities of local venues. In essence, it is the 
intent of the Committee that the second standard be a default 
minimum requirement, adaptable to future needs of local 
communities as expressly determined by each commission.
    With respect to the fourth requirement, the Committee 
recognizes that many boxing commissions currently do not 
require health insurance to be provided to boxers in their 
jurisdictions. Boxing by necessity involves serious risk of 
injury, both in training and during a match. To ensure the long 
term health and safety of boxers, as well as to reduce the 
burdens placed on Federal health care programs as a result of 
inadequate health care coverage for boxers, each boxing 
commission is effectively required to determine the appropriate 
type and amounts of health insurance that should be provided to 
boxers who fight under its supervision.

Section 6. Registration

    Each boxer must register in the State in which he or she is 
a legal resident. If a boxer is a legal resident of a foreign 
country or a State which does not have an authorized boxing 
commission, then he or she can register in any State with an 
authorized boxing commission. Upon registration, the boxing 
commission shall issue to the boxer an identification card that 
contains: (A) a recent photograph of the boxer; (B) the boxer's 
social security number (or any similar identification number 
for foreign boxers), and (C) a personal identification number 
assigned to the boxer by a boxing registry (which may be the 
same as the boxer's social security number).
    Each boxer is responsible for renewing the identification 
card at least once every two years, or more frequently as 
required by the boxing commission in the State where the boxer 
resides. The boxer must present his or her identification card 
before a match to the supervising boxing commission, no later 
than the time of the weigh-in.

Section 7. Review

    Each boxing commission must establish procedures to 
evaluate the professional records of each boxer (as obtained 
through a boxing registry) before a match, as well as the 
physician's certification that a boxer is physically fit to 
compete (as provided under Section 5(a)(1) of this Act). A 
boxing commission shall be able to deny authorization for a 
boxer to fight, based solely on such evaluation.
    A boxing commission must deny a boxer the authority to 
fight if such boxer is under suspension from any boxing 
commission due to: (A) a recent knockout or series of 
consecutive losses; (B) an injury, requirement for a medical 
procedure, or physician denial of certification; (C) failure of 
a drug test; or (D) the use of false aliases, or falsifying, or 
attempting to falsify, official identification cards or 
documents.
    Each boxing commission must further adopt procedures to 
allow a boxer to appeal a suspension ordered by such 
commission. The appeal shall include, at a minimum, the right 
of a boxer to present contradictory evidence. The suspension 
must be revoked by the boxing commission if the boxer provides 
proof of a sufficiently improved medical or physical condition 
(where the suspension was based on reasons (A) or (B) above), 
or that such suspension was not, or is no longer, merited by 
the facts. The Committee expects each boxing commission to set 
forth in its procedures the process and standards for review 
and to make such procedures publicly available. The Association 
of Boxing Commissions has agreed to publish guidelines for 
commission review procedures, as well as establishing its own 
suspension review system for appeals by boxers wishing to fight 
in States in which they have not yet been suspended.
    Subsection (b) allows a boxing commission to authorize a 
boxer to fight despite a suspension by another boxing 
commission, but only under limited circumstances. If the boxer 
is suspended for any of the reasons listed above (paragraphs A-
D of Section 7(a)(2)), then such reprieve may only be granted 
if the boxer successfully appeals to the Association of Boxing 
Commissions. The Association of Boxing Commissions may grant 
such appeal if it determines that the suspension was without 
sufficient grounds, for an improper purpose, or not related to 
the health and safety of the boxer or the purposes of this Act. 
This provision is intended to prevent a corrupt or careless 
commission from destroying the professional career of a boxer 
by allowing the boxer to make an out-of-State appeal to be able 
to fight outside the State of the suspending commission.
    Subsection (b) further allows a boxing commission to 
authorize a boxer to fight despite a suspension by another 
boxing commission for reasons other than those listed in 
paragraphs A-D of Section 7(a)(2), if the commission consults 
with and provides written notification to the suspending boxing 
commission. This provision is intended to address situations 
unrelated to a boxer's health or safety, such as (but not 
limited to) suspensions for failure to pay certain 
administrative or other fees or fines. The consultation and 
written notification provide a minimum level of investigation 
necessary for a boxing commission to determine the exact nature 
of the suspension, while allowing each commission to determine 
whether the offense is sufficiently grave to automatically 
disqualify the boxer from fighting in that State.

Section 8. Reporting

    A boxing commission must report the results of each match 
that it supervises, including any related suspensions, within 
48 hours, not including weekends and holidays, to each boxer 
registry (as certified by the Association of Boxing 
Commissions).

Section 9. Conflicts of interest

    Boxing commission members and employees, and members of the 
Association of Boxing Commissions, and any other persons who 
administer or enforce State boxing laws, may not be formally 
associated with or contracted to receive compensation from 
boxing promoters, managers, sanctioning bodies, or other 
persons with a financial interest in any active boxer. The 
Committee recognizes that many current commissioners and 
commission employees are fully involved in all aspects of 
boxing, both for personal interest and as a profit-making 
activity. While most of these individuals are honest and 
benefit their commissions with continued hands-on expertise in 
the sport, the Committee believes that a bright-line 
prohibition is necessary to begin to curb the numerous 
conflicts of interest that are severely corrupting the sport of 
boxing.
    The provision excepts from the conflict of interest test, 
however, funds held in escrow for payment to another person in 
connection with a match. For example, promoters of a match are 
often required to deposit payments for referees, judges, 
ringside physicians and other individuals involved in a match 
directly with the supervising commission. The commission holds 
these funds until the completion of the match, at which time it 
distributes the payments to the various officials.
    The provision also excepts contracts and reasonable 
compensation received by a boxing commission to supervise an 
out-of-State match, as described in Section 4.

Section 10. Enforcement

    The Attorney General of the United States is authorized to 
bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the 
United States where the Attorney General has reason to believe 
that a person is engaged in a violation of this Act. The relief 
requested shall be as the Attorney General determines to be 
necessary to prevent the continued violation of this Act, 
including a temporary or permanent injunction or restraining 
order.
    The Attorney General may also bring criminal charges 
against a manager, promoter, matchmaker, or licensee who 
knowingly violates, or coerces or causes any other person to 
violate, the provisions of this Act. Charges may also be 
brought against any member or employee of a boxing commission 
or the Association of Boxing Commissions who knowingly violates 
the conflict of interest provisions (Section 9) of this Act. 
The penalties for conviction of such offenses shall be 
imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or fines of not more 
than $20,000. The Attorney General may also charge an 
individual who violates this Act in his or her capacity as a 
boxer with penalties upon conviction of fines not to exceed 
$1,000.

Section 11. Notification of supervising boxing commission

    A promoter who intends to hold a boxing match in a State 
without an authorized boxing commission must contract with an 
authorized boxing commission from another State (as set forth 
in Section 4) to supervise the match. The promoter must provide 
written notification to such commission, at least 14 days 
before the match, of the names of any person involved in the 
match that are under suspension from any boxing commission (and 
the identity of such commissions), as well as providing 
assurances that all applicable requirements of this Act will be 
met with respect to the match.

Section 12. Studies

    Two studies are authorized to provide future guidance for 
improving the long-term health and safety of boxers. The first 
study directs the Secretary of Labor to determine the 
feasibility and cost of creating a national pension system for 
boxers, including identification of potential funding sources. 
The second study shall develop recommendations for health, 
safety, and equipment standards for the sport of boxing and 
shall be performed by the Department of Health and Human 
Services, presumably within the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health.

Section 13. Professional boxing matches conducted on Indian 
        reservations

    Tribal organizations of American Indian tribes may 
authorize a boxing match to be held within their territory, and 
may chose to either supervise the match directly, or enter into 
a contract with an authorized boxing commission of any State to 
supervise a match. The tribal organization is then responsible 
for implementing health and safety standards, licensing 
requirements, and other requirements as set forth in Sections 
5-9 of this Act that are at least as restrictive as either the 
otherwise applicable standards and requirements of a State in 
which the reservation is located, if such State has an 
authorized boxing commission, or of the most recent regulations 
published and certified by the Association of Boxing 
Commissions.

Section 14. Relationship with State law

    This provision allows States to adopt supplemental or more 
stringent regulations that are not inconsistent with this Act. 
It further clarifies that States may authorize additional 
criminal, civil, and administrative fines for violations of 
this Act or other local regulations.

Section 15. Effective date

    Section 9 on conflicts of interest shall not apply to the 
Commonwealth of Virginia until after the contract of the 
current boxing commission expires on July 1, 1998. Sections 5 
through 9 of the Act shall otherwise take effect on July 1, 
1997. The remaining sections shall become effective January 1, 
1997.

         Changes in Existing Law Made by the Bill, as Reported

    This legislation does not amend any existing Federal 
statute.
