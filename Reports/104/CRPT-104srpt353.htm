                  Summary of Committee Recommendations

    The Committee mark provides a total of $28,810,460,000 in 
fiscal year 1997 budget authority. This amount is 
$3,987,686,000 below the President's fiscal year 1997 request 
and $670,230,000 below the House-passed version of the bill. 
The Committee does not provide any of the requested advanced 
appropriations for United Nations contributions to 
international organizations or contributions for international 
peacekeeping. The Committee mark provides $23,865,200,000 in 
discretionary budget authority, $4,440,000,000 in budget 
authority from the violent crime reduction trust fund, and a 
total of $106,579,000 in rescissions for the Departments, 
agencies, and programs within the jurisdiction of the Commerce, 
Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies 
appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. The House version of 
this bill, H.R. 3814, passed the House of Representatives on a 
vote of 246 to 179 on July 24, 1996. The Committee's 
recommendations to the Senate for this bill would result in 
$24,502,000,000 in new and prior-year discretionary outlays, 
and $2,915,000,000 in new and prior-year violent crime 
reduction trust fund outlays, as estimated by the Congressional 
Budget Office. The Committee also recommends appropriations 
totaling $521,524,000 for mandatory programs within the 
jurisdiction of this bill, resulting in estimated mandatory 
outlays of $515,000,000.
    For discretionary programs, the Committee's recommended 
appropriations are $2,725,844,000 in discretionary budget 
authority and $389,258,000 in violent crime reduction trust 
fund budget authority below the President's request, 
$585,312,000 in discretionary budget authority, and $84,918,000 
in violent crime reduction trust fund budget authority below 
the House-passed bill. The Committee notes that while most of 
the programs and agencies funded by this bill--such as the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, most of the 
Department of Commerce, the Department of State, and the United 
States Information Agency--lack authorizations for 
appropriations in fiscal year 1997, it recommends that the 
Senate meet its responsibilities to the American people and 
provide appropriations for these ongoing programs.

                            Bill Highlights

    The 602(b) allocation provided to the Commerce, Justice, 
and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies [CJS] 
Subcommittee is a total of $3,963,646,000 in budget authority 
below the President's request, $646,190,000 below the House-
passed bill, and $724,000,000 above a Congressional Budget 
Office freeze. This allocation was consistent with assumptions 
contained in the conference report on House Concurrent 
Resolution 178, the concurrent resolution on the budget for 
fiscal year 1997, which assumed an $800,000,000, or 3.8 percent 
increase, for administration of justice, which includes law 
enforcement activities at the Justice and Treasury Departments, 
and other Federal agencies.
    The Committee notes that a 3.8-percent increase for the 
Department of Justice would force hiring freezes and reductions 
in force at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, the Border Patrol, and several 
other important law enforcement agencies. A 3.8-percent funding 
increase would force the Bureau of Prisons to close newly 
opened prison facilities and delay bringing new Federal prison 
facilities online.
    In order to provide adequate resources for crime-fighting 
activities at the Federal, State, and local level, the 
Committee's mark cuts noncrime-fighting accounts by a total of 
$677,861,000--or 6.5 percent--below a freeze in order to 
provide a $1,331,572,000 increase to fund legitimate Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement activities and an increase of 
$227,472,000 to the Federal judiciary to handle increased 
caseload.
Department of Justice
    The Committee mark contains a comprehensive crime-fighting 
initiative with a special emphasis placed on counterterrorism. 
The recommendation provides $15,904,168,000 in resources to the 
Department of Justice, including the maximum funding allowed 
from the violent crime reduction trust fund.
    The Committee's crime-fighting initiative provides funding 
to support Federal, State, and local law enforcement, prisons, 
prosecutors, and other crime-fighting activities.
    Highlights of the initiative include:
  --Comprehensive counterterrorism initiative.--$152,026,000 in 
        increased resources to: (1) prevent, investigate, and 
        improve rapid response capabilities to potential 
        terrorist threats; (2) increase security measures to 
        help protect the lives of Americans at home and abroad; 
        and (3) target State sponsors of terrorism;
  --$2,699,500,000 to support State and local law enforcement 
        including $1,400,000,000 for the Community Oriented 
        Policing Services [COPS] Program to meet the shared 
        goal of hiring 100,000 new police by the year 2000, 
        $503,000,000 for the local law enforcement block grant, 
        and $535,000,000 for the Edward Byrne Memorial State 
        and Local Law Enforcement Grant Program;
  --$4,664,268,000 to support Federal law enforcement agencies 
        such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug 
        Enforcement Administration, and the Border Patrol;
  --$4,447,776,000 in appropriations and fee-funded accounts to 
        incarcerate Federal prisoners, apprehend and detain 
        fugitives, operate and maintain existing Federal prison 
        facilities, and build and activate new or expanded 
        facilities;
  --$970,000,000 in grants to support State and local prison 
        construction for the incarceration of violent criminals 
        and reimburse States and localities for the costs of 
        incarcerating criminal aliens;
  --$1,394,344,000 for U.S. attorneys and general legal 
        activities to enhance Federal prosecution of criminals; 
        and
  --$197,500,000, the full amount authorized, for the Violence 
        Against Women Act Program.
    In the wake of the World Trade Center bombing, the bombing 
of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, the 
bombing in Dahran, Saudi Arabia, the apparent bombing of TWA 
Flight 800, and the bombing at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic 
Park, the Committee has made counterterrorism a top priority in 
this bill. For that reason, the Committee has shifted violent 
crime reduction trust fund [VCRTF] resources away from so-
called prevention programs toward counterterrorism and other 
critical law enforcement activities as authorized in the 
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public 
Law 104-132) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement 
Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322).
    As part of this effort, the Committee proposes three 
provisions from the Senate-passed version of the Comprehensive 
Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995. The provisions relating to 
taggants, multipoint wiretaps, and expanded wiretap authority 
for terrorism investigations are included as general provisions 
in title I.
    The Committee has left no stone unturned in his effort to 
save the taxpayers money; the mark would cut $76,998,000 from 
the President's fiscal year 1997 budget request for the 1997 
cost of Justice personnel who were not hired or prisons which 
were not activated in fiscal year 1996 even though Congress 
provided adequate funding for this purpose. The Committee's 
mark would allow $90,000,000 in end-of-year carryover balances 
at the Bureau of Prisons to remain available in fiscal year 
1997 to support ongoing Federal prison operations. The 
Committee mark saves an additional $132,385,000 by increasing 
the use of current Immigration and Naturalization Service fee 
collections for authorized congressional crime-fighting 
priorities.
Department of Commerce
    The Committee recommends a total of $3,640,807,000 for the 
U.S. Trade Representative, the International Trade Commission, 
and the Department of Commerce for fiscal year 1997. 
Recommended funding for these accounts is $685,367,000 below 
the President's request, $48,224,000 below a freeze at fiscal 
year 1996 levels, and $104,554,000 above the funding contained 
in the House-passed bill.
    On May 8, 1996, in his first appearance before the Senate 
as Secretary of Commerce, Michael Kantor announced an 
initiative to reduce Commerce personnel by an additional 5 
percent below current levels within the next 7 months. While 
most of these reductions are a direct result of the 1996 
appropriation (Public Law 104-134), the Committee welcomes 
Secretary Kantor's contribution to streamlining departmental 
operations and has built the Kantor plan into his assumptions 
for fiscal year 1997 funding for the Department.
    The recommendation includes $1,998,349,000 for the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA], an increase of 
$137,695,000 in order to enhance environmental stewardship, 
manage our Nation's fisheries, and continue modernization of 
the National Weather Service.
    For the Census Bureau, a total of $350,200,000 is provided. 
This is an increase of $66,078,000 over fiscal year 1996 to 
increase economic information and prepare for the 2000 census.
    The Committee recognizes the Government's role in continued 
basic research and continues its support for the core functions 
of the National Institute of Science and Technology and 
continues support for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership--
Hollings Center--Program.
    The fiscal year 1996 appropriation eliminated the U.S. 
Travel and Tourism Administration. The Committee recommends 
major downsizing of the Economic Development Administration, 
the Advanced Technology Program, the Minority Business 
Development Agency, the Information Infrastructure Grant 
Program, and several other functions within the Department.
The judiciary
    The recommendation provides a total of $3,282,284,000, an 
increase of $227,472,000, over fiscal year 1996 levels, to help 
the judiciary handle the increased caseload resulting from 
additional Federal prosecution efforts funded by the Committee. 
This amount includes an increase of $25,000,000 for security of 
the courts in light of the threat of terrorism.
Department of State and related agencies
    In total, recommended funding for the Department of State, 
the U.S. Information Agency, and the Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency are at or below the fiscal year 1997 
authorized levels contained in the conference report to 
accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1996-97, as passed by the Senate on March 28, 
1996. Funding for virtually every program in this title is at 
or below the fiscal year 1997 authorization level provided in 
that bill.
    The recommendation provides $2,639,429,000 for State 
Department operations and an additional $8,400,000 from the 
counterterrorism fund at the Department of Justice for enhanced 
security at overseas posts. In total, this funding level is 
$28,114,000 above the levels provided in the House-passed bill, 
$66,598,000 below the President's request, and $524,331,000 
below a freeze at fiscal year 1996 levels. The recommendation 
also contains a new initiative aimed at improving management of 
overseas real estate.
    The recommendation provides $550,000,000 for contributions 
to international organizations and provides no funds for 
payment of arrearages. Sufficient funding is provided to cover 
the full fiscal year 1997 assessment for U.S. participation in 
the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Trade 
Organization, and the International Civil Aviation 
Organization. The recommendation includes a reform initiative 
aimed at encouraging the State Department to hold the United 
Nations to its goal of a no-growth budget for the 1996-97 
biennium.
    The recommendation provides $282,600,000, the full fiscal 
year 1997 assessment, for contributions for United Nations 
peacekeeping operations. No funding is provided for payment of 
arrearages.
    The recommendation fully funds Cuba broadcasting operations 
as a separate appropriations account.
    The recommendation eliminates funding for the Asia 
Foundation and the National Endowment for Democracy.
Other related agencies
    A total of $698,919,000 is provided to the Small Business 
Administration to promote small business development. This 
amount includes an increase of $55,851,000 for Business Loan 
Programs to maintain access to capital for small businesses.
    The recommendation does not provide funding for the 
Maritime National Security Program. The Committee notes that 
$46,000,000 was provided for this new program in fiscal year 
1996 pending authorization of the program. To date, no 
authorization has been enacted.
    The recommendation would provide funding for the Legal 
Services Corporation of $288,000,000, and would maintain 
restrictions on the use of these funds in order to focus these 
resources to where the greatest need exists.
Rescissions
    The Committee mark rescinds a total of $106,579,000 from 
four accounts--two in the Department of Justice and two in the 
Department of Commerce. Rescission amounts are based on 
estimates provided to the Committee on or before June 25, 1996.
    Proposed rescissions include: $30,000,000 from the working 
capital fund at the Department of Justice, $34,779,000 from the 
immigration emergency fund at the INS, $31,800,000 from 
construction at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology, and $10,000,000 from NOAA.
                     TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

    The Committee has made funding for law enforcement the 
centerpiece of the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill.
    The Committee's 602(b) allocation for nondefense 
discretionary spending is $3,767,800,000 below the President's 
request and $783,600,000 above a freeze at fiscal year 1996 
funding levels.
    The Committee recommends $15,904,168,000 in new budget 
(obligational) authority in the accompanying bill for the 
Department of Justice with a strong emphasis on law enforcement 
activities for fiscal year 1997. This amount is $1,331,572,000 
more than the fiscal year 1996 funding level. The remaining 
$4,440,000 is derived from the violent crime reduction trust 
fund, which is an increase of $484,031,000 in trust fund 
spending over the current year, and $84,918,000 less than the 
trust fund spending recommended by the House.

                         General Administration

                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $74,282,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      83,256,000
House allowance.........................................      78,493,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              70,653,000

    This account funds the development of policy objectives and 
the overall management of the Department of Justice.
    The Committee recommends a total of $70,653,000 for general 
administration for fiscal year 1997. This amount is $3,629,000 
below the fiscal year 1996 appropriation, $12,603,000 below the 
request, and $7,840,000 below the House allowance.
    The recommendation provides sufficient resources to 
maintain current staffing and operations with one exception. 
For fiscal year 1997, the Justice Department plans to employ 
more than 250 people at a projected cost to the taxpayers of 
more than $25,000,000 for legislative and public affairs. To 
ensure that scarce resources are targeted to the support and 
oversight of crime-fighting activities, the Committee has 
recommended bill language freezing legislative and public 
affairs activities at fiscal year 1995 levels throughout the 
Department. These activities may not be supplemented by either 
reimbursable or nonreimbursable details.
    The recommendation includes a requested reduction of 
$5,000,000 in resources provided in fiscal year 1996 for 
departmental management and financial oversight of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS].
    The Committee notes that on June 6, 1996, the Department of 
Justice estimated that there would be $5,125,000 in end-of-year 
carryover balances in this account. The Committee directs that 
these resources will be used to continue existing operations 
with the exceptions noted above.
    The recommendation does not include $3,200,000 under this 
account and $11,924,000 under the Office of Inspector General 
for the preparation and audit of Department-wide financial 
statements required under the Government Management Reform Act 
of 1994. The Committee concurs in the House recommendation 
directing the general manager of the Department's working 
capital fund [WCF] to use retained earnings available in fiscal 
year 1997 to cover the necessary costs for preparation and 
audit of financial statements for those appropriation accounts 
within the Department of Justice which are regular customers of 
the WCF.
    Comprehensive review of Federal detention and 
incarceration.--Three separate agencies within the Department 
of Justice play a major role in detention and incarceration--
the Bureau of Prisons [BOP], the U.S. Marshals Service, and the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS]. The Committee 
supports the Attorney General's efforts to consolidate 
duplicative functions within the Department of Justice, such as 
the joint prison alien transportation system [JPATS]. While 
budgetary constraints will prevent the Department of Justice 
from continuing to grow at current rates, demographic changes, 
increased resources for law enforcement and prosecution, and 
longer sentences will continue to stretch prison and detention 
capacity. Under these circumstances, the Committee believes 
that a thorough review of the current BOP, U.S. Marshals, and 
INS Federal prisoner and detainee programs is warranted. The 
Committee directs the Attorney General to evaluate the 
performance of these agencies and develop recommendations to 
consolidate management of their operations where possible. 
Recommendations are to be submitted to the Committee by 
November 15, 1997. Past administrations responded to similar 
requests by endorsing the status quo. The Committee would urge 
the Attorney General not to make the same mistake. In recent 
years, Congress has invested heavily in border control and 
enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. Alien detention and 
incarceration appears to be a weak link in the administration's 
current immigration policy, one that needs critical attention. 
The report should: (1) analyze the performance of each of the 
three agencies with major Federal prisoner and detainee 
programs in the Department of Justice; (2) evaluate whether a 
major consolidation of those functions into one or two agencies 
over a 3- to 5-year timeframe is warranted; and (3) recommend 
interim steps which would reduce costs and streamline 
operations of Federal prisoner and detainee operations, such as 
a consolidated ground transportation system, or a unified 
construction management operation.
    Federal/State cargo theft task force.--Within resources 
provided to the Department, the Committee directs the Attorney 
General to allocate $1,000,000 to implement the Federal/State 
cargo theft task force announced by Attorney General Reno in 
1994.
    The recommendation does not include bill language proposed 
by the House to eliminate the Office of the Associate Attorney 
General.

                         counterterrorism fund

                     (including transfer of funds)

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $16,898,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       9,688,000
House allowance.........................................       9,450,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              40,000,000

    The Committee recommends $40,000,000 for the 
``Counterterrorism fund'' account which was established in 
Public Law 104-19, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations 
for Additional Disaster Assistance, for Anti-Terrorism 
Initiatives, for Assistance in the Recovery from the Tragedy 
that Occurred at Oklahoma City, and Rescissions Act, 1995. This 
fund is under the control and direction of the Attorney 
General, to: (1) cover the extraordinary and contingency costs 
that have occurred and are expected to occur as a result of the 
Oklahoma City bombing, and (2) to cover costs related to any 
potential or actual future domestic or international terrorist 
act.
    The recommendation provides $30,312,000 more than the 
request, $30,550,000 more than the House allowance, and 
$23,102,000 more than the 1996 appropriation.
    Comprehensive counterterrorism strategy.--The Committee is 
deeply concerned that the administration lacks a comprehensive 
strategy for combating domestic and international terrorism. 
The Committee directs that the Attorney General, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Defense, the National Security Advisor, the Director of Central 
Intelligence, the Secretary of Transportation, the DIAP, and 
representatives from State and local law enforcement, develop 
recommendations for implementation of a comprehensive 5-year 
counterterrorism strategy. At a minimum, the plan must contain 
(1) resource requirements, (2) a national infrastructure threat 
assessment, (3) improved Federal, State, and local coordination 
of counterterrorism, and (4) a deployment strategy. The 
strategic plan is to be submitted to the Senate and House 
Appropriations Committees by no later than November 15, 1996.
    Counterterrorism initiative.--The Committee recognizes that 
several Federal, State, and local agencies have a role in 
combating terrorism. Funds are provided in this account to 
supplement that effort. Recommended increases include:
    Joint terrorism task forces.--$2,700,000 for increased 
state and local participation in FBI joint terrorism task 
forces.
    Increased State/local role in counterterrorism.--$1,500,000 
for a new program to support details of State and local law 
enforcement officials at the FBI Counterterrorism Center.
    Enhanced diplomatic security.--$8,400,000 to the State 
Department for enhanced security measures at overseas posts. 
The recommendation includes $4,300,000 for security equipment, 
$2,700,000 for the local guard program, and $1,400,000 for 
armored vehicles in terrorist threat posts. These increases are 
consistent with recommendations contained in the State 
Department's spring 1996 infrastructure requirements.
    Enhanced investigations of chemical/biological/nuclear 
export controls.--$2,500,000 for the Bureau of Export 
Administration [BXA] at the Department of Commerce to increase 
on-board criminal investigator staff (25 positions and 22 
FTE's) to investigate alleged export control violations--
particularly those involving nuclear and missile technology 
controls and chemical and biological controls. The Committee 
expects BXA to pursue investigations without impeding 
legitimate international trade.
    Lookout Program expansion.--$3,826,000 for 30 FBI positions 
and 15 FTE's to staff surveillance posts to monitor, identify, 
and neutralize activities of State sponsors of terrorism.
    Security at new courthouses.--$4,000,000 to supplement 
funds under the judiciary's ``Court security'' account in order 
to provide for security officers and associated equipment at 
new and renovated Federal courthouses.
    Targeting State sponsors of terrorism.--$3,000,000 to 
international broadcasting operations at the U.S. Information 
Agency to increase programming to countries the United States 
lists as sponsors of terrorism as well as countries where 
American citizens and property are threatened by acts of 
terrorism. Funding is to be allocated on the basis of 
Broadcasting Board of Governors recommendations subject to the 
reprogramming procedures outlined in section 605 of this act.
    There will be necessary expenses that are not known at the 
present time such as the cost of investigating the July 27, 
1996, bombing at Olympic Centennial Park in Atlanta, GA. The 
Committee recommendation allows the Attorney General to make 
the determination on a case-by-case basis of other necessary 
expenses which may be covered by funds appropriated to this 
account. The Attorney General may also use these funds to 
engage in planning, and the execution of plans, related to 
upcoming significant events which offer the potential of being 
targeted for acts of terrorism. As part of this prevention and 
deterrence effort, the Committee has provided the following:
    2002 winter Olympic games, Salt Lake City, UT.--The 
Attorney General is directed to work with State and local law 
enforcement officials in Utah to develop a security plan for 
the upcoming Olympic games. The Committee recommendation 
provides $3,000,000 for necessary counterterrorism security and 
communications infrastructure enhancements and upgrades in 
preparation for the 2002 games.
    Bill language is added to provide that of the funds 
provided in this account, $8,400,000 is to be provided to the 
Department of State for overseas diplomatic security 
enhancements as outlined in the Department of State's spring 
1996 infrastructure requirements report. Bill language is 
included to provide $2,500,000 to the Bureau of Export 
Administration at the Department of Commerce to increase 
onboard criminal investigator staff in export enforcement to 
investigate alleged export control violations--particularly 
those involving nuclear and missile technology controls and 
chemical and biological controls. Bill language is included to 
provide $4,000,000 to court security for the Federal judiciary.
    The Attorney General is required to notify the Committees 
on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the 
Senate in accordance with section 605 of this act, prior to the 
obligation of any funds from this account.

                   Administrative Review and Appeals

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $86,666,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     126,258,000
House allowance.........................................     112,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             107,909,000

    The recommendation would provide funding of $107,909,000 
for fiscal year 1997, of which $48,000,000 is provided from the 
violent crime reduction trust fund, $18,349,000 less in total 
budget resources than the request, and $4,091,000 less than the 
House allowance.
    This account provides funding for the Executive Office for 
Immigration Review [EOIR]. EOIR includes the Board of 
Immigration Appeals, immigration judges, and administrative law 
judges who decide through administrative hearings whether to 
admit or exclude aliens seeking to enter the country, and 
whether to deport or adjust the status of aliens whose status 
has been challenged. This account also funds the Office of the 
Pardon Attorney which receives, investigates, and considers 
petitions for all forms of Executive clemency. The 
recommendation would provide a total of $106,428,000 for EOIR 
and $1,481,000 for the Office of the Pardon Attorney.
    In addition to providing sufficient resources to maintain 
current operations, the Committee recommendation includes the 
following increases for EOIR:
    Expedited removal of deportable aliens.--$2,099,000, 8 
immigration judges and 16 support positions.
    Caseload resulting from increased border enforcement.--
$4,397,000, 16 immigration judges and 32 support staff.
    Expedited processing of asylum and criminal alien cases.--
$3,870,000, 40 staff attorneys and 14 support positions for the 
Board of Immigration Appeals as the final installment of a 
planned 3-year expansion of EOIR designed to handle increased 
asylum and criminal alien caseload on an expedited basis.
    Of the total amount provided, $48,000,000 is for expanded 
special deportation proceedings under the violent crime 
reduction trust fund as authorized by the Violent Crime Control 
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-322.

                      Office of Inspector General

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $28,960,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      51,949,000
House allowance.........................................      31,960,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              31,960,000

    The Committee recommends $31,960,000 for the Office of 
Inspector General for fiscal year 1997. This amount is 
$19,989,000 below the request. The recommendation is $3,000,000 
more than the current year appropriation and is identical to 
the House allowance.
    Although the Committee did not include the requested base 
transfer of $5,000,000 from the ``General administration'' 
account for additional audits of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Services [INS], the Committee concurs with the 
House recommendation to transfer $1,000,000 from INS 
legislative and public affairs to support increased audits and 
investigations of INS.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous fiscal years, which makes: (1) up to 
$10,000 of this appropriation available for emergencies of a 
confidential nature; and (2) funds available for the 
acquisition of motor vehicles.

                         U.S. Parole Commission

                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $5,446,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       5,201,000
House allowance.........................................       4,490,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               5,201,000

    This Commission is an independent body within the 
Department of Justice which makes decisions regarding requests 
for parole and supervision of Federal prisoners.
    The Committee recommends $5,201,000 for the Parole 
Commission for fiscal year 1997. This amount is $235,000 less 
than the current year appropriation, and is the same as the 
request.
    The Parole Commission is scheduled to be phased out as a 
result of the creation of sentencing guidelines. The 
Committee's recommendation assumes that the Commission will 
continue to reduce its staffing level in order to facilitate a 
timely termination of its operations.

                            Legal Activities

                        general legal activities

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $421,520,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     458,027,000
House allowance.........................................     428,543,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             429,028,000

    This appropriation funds the establishment of litigation 
policy, conduct of litigation, and various other legal 
responsibilities, through the Office of the Solicitor General, 
the Tax Division, the Criminal Division, the Civil Division, 
the Environmental and Natural Resources Division, the Civil 
Rights Division, the Office of Legal Counsel, Interpol, and the 
Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair 
Employment Practices.
    The Committee recommends a total of $429,028,000 for 
general legal activities for fiscal year 1997, of which 
$7,750,000 is provided from the violent crime reduction trust 
fund [VCRTF] as authorized in the Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-322) and the 
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public 
Law 104-132). The total amount recommended is $7,508,000 more 
than current year funding, and is $28,999,000 less than the 
request.
    The $7,750,000 derived from the VCRTF is to sustain the 
cost of Civil Division attorneys working for the deportation of 
criminal aliens. This recommendation continues an effort begun 
last year to use violent crime trust fund amounts to strengthen 
enforcement of our immigration laws.
    In order to continue to strongly support law enforcement 
with the limited budgetary resources available this year, the 
Committee has provided for an increase in order to maintain 
current levels of strength at the Criminal Division, and 
intends that the reduction from the total request for legal 
activities will not negatively impact the operations of the 
Criminal Division. In addition, the Committee recommendation 
assumes adequate resources will be provided to the Civil Rights 
Division in light of recent church burnings.
    The Committee recommends bill language, similar to that 
included in previous fiscal years, which: (1) allows up to 
$20,000 for expenses of collecting evidence; (2) makes up to 
$10,000,000 available for litigation support contracts; (3) 
makes up to $17,525,000 available for office automation 
systems; (4) makes up to $1,000 available to the U.S. National 
Central Bureau--Interpol for reception and representation 
expenses; and (5) allows acceptance of gifts for hosting the 
1997 Interpol regional conference.
    Bill language is added freezing legislative and public 
affairs staffing in this account at fiscal year 1995 levels.

               the national childhood vaccine injury act

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $4,028,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       4,028,000
House allowance.........................................       4,028,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               4,028,000

    The Committee recommends a reimbursement of $4,028,000 for 
fiscal year 1997 from the vaccine injury compensation trust 
fund to cover Justice Department expenses associated with 
litigating cases under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury 
Act of 1986. This amount is the same as the request and the 
current year appropriation.

                           Antitrust Division

                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $85,143,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      94,979,000
House allowance.........................................      84,336,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              94,979,000

    The Antitrust Division investigates potential violations of 
Federal antitrust laws, represents the interests of the United 
States in cases brought under these laws, acts on antitrust 
cases before the Supreme Court, and reviews decisions of 
regulatory commissions relating to antitrust law.
    The Committee recommendation assumes a total of $94,979,000 
in budget (obligational) authority for the Antitrust Division 
for fiscal year 1997. This recommendation is the full requested 
amount for fiscal year 1997, is $9,836,000 more than the amount 
provided in the current year, and is $10,643,000 more than the 
House allowance. The full amount provided will be derived from 
anticipated offsetting fee collections in fiscal year 1997, 
resulting in no new net direct appropriation for this account. 
The Committee notes that use of unobligated fee collections 
from the prior year are subject to the reprogramming 
requirements outlined in section 605 of this act.
    The recommendation includes bill language under the 
``Federal Trade Commission'' [FTC] account that changes the 
current Hart-Scott-Rodino filing fee structure from a flat fee 
to a graduated fee scale. This structure reduces the amount of 
the fee for acquiring companies with assets of $100,000,000 or 
less, and increases the fees on larger companies; this is 
intended to reduce the burden on small business, while more 
accurately reflecting the enforcement workload of the Antitrust 
Division and the Federal Trade Commission.
    The recommendation includes bill language for the Antitrust 
Division, similar to that included in previous fiscal years, 
which: (1) allows $94,979,000 in fees to be credited to this 
account; (2) reduces appropriated funds as fees are collected; 
and (3) makes fees in excess of $94,979,000 available until 
expended in fiscal year 1998. Language proposed in the budget 
is also included which adds the phrase ``from the general 
fund'' to make it clear that the source of appropriated funding 
for the Division is the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.

                             U.S. Attorneys

                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $925,509,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     993,688,000
House allowance.........................................     974,905,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             965,316,000

    This account supports the Executive Office for U.S. 
Attorneys and the 94 U.S. attorneys offices throughout the 
United States and its territories. The U.S. attorneys serve as 
the principal litigators for the U.S. Government for criminal, 
civil, and debt collection matters.
    The Committee recommends a total of $965,316,000 for the 
U.S. attorneys for fiscal year 1997, of which $31,000,000 is 
provided from the violent crime reduction trust fund [VCRTF] as 
authorized in Public Law 103-322 and Public Law 104-132. The 
total amount provided is an increase of $39,807,000 above 
current year funding, $28,372,000 below the request, and is 
$9,589,000 below the House allowance.
    The Committee recommendation provides for all requested 
increases to preserve the current strength of the U.S. 
attorneys offices. The Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys is 
encouraged to identify budgetary savings, in addition to the 
administrative savings allocated in fiscal year 1996, with 
which to fund the highest priority program increases. Of 
amounts available from the violent crime reduction trust fund, 
$1,000,000 is provided for Federal victim counselors to address 
violence against women, and $9,633,000 is provided for 
deportation of criminal aliens.
    The Committee intends that, of the amounts available to the 
Department of Justice in this act, up to $3,800,000 may be 
allocated to fund supervision of the 1996 International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters election, subject either to the 
reprogramming authorities provided in section 605 of this act 
or the transfer authorities in section 107 of this act.
    The Committee notes that the pilot debt collection program 
Congress established to make use of private entities has proven 
effective to recover some of the billions in outstanding nontax 
debts owed to the Federal Government. To the extent possible 
within the resources provided, the Committee directs the 
Department of Justice to expand this pilot program.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous fiscal years, which: (1) makes up to 
$2,500,000 for debt collection purposes available until 1998; 
(2) makes up to $10,000,000 for automated litigation support 
contracts available until expended; and (3) makes available up 
to $8,000 to be used for official reception and representation 
expenses.

                        u.s. trustee system fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $102,390,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     111,633,000
House allowance.........................................     107,950,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             107,950,000

    The U.S. trustee system provides administrative support to 
expeditiously move bankruptcy cases through the bankruptcy 
process and ensures accountability of private trustees 
appointed to administer bankruptcy estates. This system was 
authorized in Public Law 99-554, the Bankruptcy Judges, U.S. 
Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986. It also 
established a U.S. trustee system fund in the U.S. Treasury, 
and provided for the collection of fees into the fund to 
finance program operations.
    The Committee recommendation provides a total of 
$107,950,000 in budget (obligational) authority for the U.S. 
trustees for fiscal year 1997. This level is $5,678,000 above 
current year authority, is $3,683,000 below the budget request, 
and is the same as the House allowance.
    The recommendation includes new language as in the budget 
request, under section 109, to restructure quarterly fee 
payments for debtors under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 
but does not include the new surcharge on chapter 13 trustees 
payments proposed by the administration. In addition, the 
Committee recommendation includes language to allow all fees 
collected to be used as offsetting collections to the U.S. 
trustee program.
    The recommendation also includes bill language which: (1) 
allows deposits to the U.S. trustee system fund to be used to 
pay refunds due depositors; (2) allows $107,950,000 in 
offsetting fee collections to be retained and used for 
necessary expenses in this appropriation; (3) reduces 
appropriated funds as such fees are collected; and (4) makes 
offsetting fee collections in excess of $107,950,000 available 
until expended in fiscal year 1998.

                  foreign claims settlement commission

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $830,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         878,000
House allowance.........................................         878,000

Committee recommendation

                                                                 953,000

    The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission settles claims of 
American citizens arising out of nationalization, 
expropriation, or other takings of their properties and 
interests by foreign governments. The Committee recommends 
$953,000 for the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission for 
fiscal year 1997. This amount is $75,000 above both the request 
and the House allowance in order to provide for the 
adjudication of claims against Germany relating to World War 
II, arising under Public Law 104-99 and the September 19, 1995, 
settlement agreement between the United States and Germany.

                         U.S. Marshals Service

                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $448,248,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     515,039,000
House allowance.........................................     485,214,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             482,495,000

    The U.S. Marshals Service is made up of 94 U.S. marshals 
offices with the responsibility for the protection of the 
Federal judiciary, protection of witnesses, execution of 
warrants and court orders, and the custody and transportation 
of unsentenced prisoners.
    The Committee recommends $482,495,000 for the U.S. Marshals 
Service for fiscal year 1997, of which $25,000,000 will be 
provided from the violent crime reduction trust fund [VCRTF] as 
authorized in Public Law 103-322. This amount is $34,247,000 
above the current year appropriation, $32,544,000 less than the 
request, and $2,719,000 less than the House allowance.
    The Committee recommendation provides the requested costs 
of keeping the Marshals Service at its current strength, plus 
some increases described below. The recommendation assumes that 
$5,117,000 of funds previously needed within the Seized Assets 
Management Program will be available for use elsewhere because 
noted improvements in the management of that program have led 
to significant employee reductions.
    The Committee recommendation includes increases of 
$22,214,000 for costs relating to new or renovated courthouse 
locations, including necessary equipment and staffing. In 
addition, the recommendation provides increases of $4,700,000 
to correct security deficiencies at the D.C. Superior Court, 
$3,708,000 to restore intermittent deputy positions for 
prisoner related activities, $426,000 for enhanced witness 
security, and $5,000,000 for adequate personnel to support 
increased law enforcement efforts in various parts of the 
country. The Committee encourages the Marshals Service to 
identify additional savings in order to meet other requested 
increases including additional judicial protection and 
development of an enhanced prisoner tracking information 
system.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous appropriations acts, which allows up 
to $6,000 to be used for official reception and representation 
expenses, and allows for the acquisition of motor vehicles for 
police-type use without regard to the general purchase price 
limitation. New bill language is included which makes up to 
$4,000,000 for development, implementation, maintenance and 
support, and training for an automated prisoner information 
system, and $2,200,000 for the justice prisoner and alien 
transportation system [JPATS], available until expended. In 
addition, bill language is included which will allow the 
Marshals Service to earn reimbursement for the maintenance and 
transport of State, local, and territorial prisoners by JPATS.
    Bill language is added freezing legislative and public 
affairs staffing at fiscal year 1995 levels.

                       federal prisoner detention

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $252,820,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     405,262,000
House allowance.........................................     405,262,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             405,262,000

    Under this program, the U.S. marshals contract with State 
and local jails and private facilities to house unsentenced 
Federal prisoners for short periods of time, usually before and 
during trial, and while awaiting transfer to Federal 
institutions after conviction.
    The Committee recommendation includes a direct 
appropriation of $405,262,000 for Federal prisoner detention 
for fiscal year 1997, the full amount requested in the budget. 
This amount is $109,931,000 above the appropriation for the 
current year, and is the same as the House allowance.
    The Committee notes that the large increase in funding for 
this account reflects a restoration of $73,511,000 in carryover 
funding used in fiscal year 1996, and an increase to reflect an 
estimated rise in jail days of 844,000 over the fiscal year 
1996 level. The total estimated number of jail days for fiscal 
year 1997 is 8,934,101, an increase of 11 percent over the 
current year, and an increase of 31 percent since 1994. At the 
same time, many local facilities no longer have extra room for 
Federal prisoners because of rising arrest rates at the local 
level. The Department's Federal detention plan for 1993-97 
warned of a Federal detention crisis that could threaten public 
safety, and described efforts within the Marshals Service, 
Bureau of Prisons, and Immigration and Naturalization Service 
to plan for this crisis. The Committee looks forward to the 
timely update this year of that report in order to adequately 
plan for future needs in this area. The Committee directs the 
Department to include a plan for addressing the problems it has 
experienced in developing accurate USMS detention population 
projections. In addition, the Committee expects the Department 
to continue to cooperate in innovative approaches to detention 
needs, such as the consolidation of detention space within 
conveniently located Federal buildings used by other law 
enforcement agencies.
    The Committee disagrees with House report language 
regarding detention of criminal aliens at Naval Air Station 
[NAS] Miramar. In addition, the Committee is aware of concern 
regarding the ability to detain and transport Federal prisoners 
in Utah, and urges the Department to carefully consider the 
status of detention needs in that area.

                     fees and expenses of witnesses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $85,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     102,702,000
House allowance.........................................     100,702,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             102,702,000

    This account provides for fees and expenses of witnesses 
who appear on behalf of the Government in cases in which the 
United States is a party, including fact and expert witnesses. 
These funds are also used for mental competency examinations 
and witness/informant protection.
    The Committee recommends $100,702,000 for fees and expenses 
of witnesses for fiscal year 1997. This amount is the full 
budget estimate for this program, which is considered mandatory 
for budget scorekeeping purposes. The Committee recommendation 
provides an additional $2,000,000 under this account, as 
requested in the budget, for alternative dispute resolution 
efforts in order to reduce delays currently experienced with 
civil litigation in cases where the Federal Government is a 
party.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous appropriations acts, which allows: 
(1) up to $4,750,000 for protected witness safe sites; (2) up 
to $1,000,000 for the purchase and maintenance of armored 
vehicles for prisoner transportation; and (3) up to $4,000,000 
available for the purchase, installation, and maintenance of a 
secure automated information system.

                      community relations service

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $5,319,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       5,502,000
House allowance.........................................       5,319,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               5,319,000

    The Committee recommendation provides $5,319,000 for the 
Community Relations Service for fiscal year 1997, the same as 
current year funding and $183,000 below the budget request.
    The Community Relations Service [CRS] provides assistance 
to communities and persons in the prevention and resolution of 
disagreements relating to perceived discriminatory practices. 
The functions formerly conducted by the Community Relations 
Service within the reception, processing, and care of Cubans 
and Haitians program [CHEP] were transferred to the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service [INS] pursuant to the fiscal year 
1996 appropriations act.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, identical to 
that included in fiscal year 1996, which allows the Attorney 
General to provide additional resources for CRS, through a 
transfer of funds from other Department of Justice programs 
under section 605 of this act, if emergent circumstances exist.

                         assets forfeiture fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $30,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      30,000,000
House allowance.........................................      16,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              30,000,000

    This account provides funds to supplement existing 
resources to cover additional investigative expenses of the 
FBI, DEA, INS, and U.S. marshals, such as awards for 
information, purchase of evidence, equipping of conveyances, 
and investigative expenses leading to seizure. Funds for these 
activities are provided from receipts deposited in the assets 
forfeiture fund resulting from the forfeiture of assets. 
Expenses related to the management and disposal of assets are 
also provided from the assets forfeiture fund by a permanent 
indefinite appropriation.
    The Committee recommends $30,000,000 for the assets 
forfeiture fund for fiscal year 1997. This amount is the same 
as current year funding and the budget request, and is 
$14,000,000 more than the House allowance.

                    Radiation Exposure Compensation

                        administrative expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $2,655,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       2,000,000
House allowance.........................................       2,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               2,000,000

    This program was established to permit the payment of 
claims to individuals exposed to radiation as a result of 
atmospheric nuclear tests and uranium mining in accordance with 
the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990.
    The Committee recommends $2,000,000, the full amount 
requested and the same level as the House allowance, for the 
expenses of the Civil Division necessary to handle claims and 
litigation arising from the Radiation Exposure Compensation 
Act. The recommendation is $655,000 below the current level.

          payment to the radiation exposure compensation fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $16,264,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      13,736,000
House allowance.........................................      13,736,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              13,736,000

    This account provides funds to be available in order to 
make payments to approved claimants under the Radiation 
Exposure Compensation Act of 1990. The Committee is aware that 
recent estimates show that carryover funding of $13,854,000, 
plus interest earnings, plus the advance appropriation of 
$16,264,000 provided last year for fiscal year 1997 will 
provide sufficient funds to meet all expected needs for fiscal 
year 1997. The Committee recommendation includes an 
appropriation of $13,736,000 to be made available on September 
30, 1997.

                      Interagency Law Enforcement

                 Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $359,843,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     372,017,000
House allowance.........................................     372,017,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             352,461,000

    The Interagency Crime and Drug Enforcement Program, through 
its 13 regional task forces, utilizes the combined resources 
and expertise of its 11 member Federal agencies, in cooperation 
with State and local investigators and prosecutors, to target 
and destroy major narcotics trafficking and money laundering 
organizations. Through this program, the 1996 appropriation 
provided $71,741,000 to the Treasury Department, $625,000 to 
the Coast Guard, and $1,469,000 for an administrative office.
    The Committee recommends $352,461,000 for interagency crime 
and drug enforcement for fiscal year 1997, $7,382,000 below 
fiscal year 1996 funding levels, $19,556,000 below the request, 
and $19,556,000 below the House allowance.
    While the Committee supports interagency coordination in 
the fight against crime, many of the administrative 
requirements that apply to participating agencies in these task 
forces add another layer of redtape and overhead costs to 
investigations with little operational benefit. The Committee 
notes that this coordinating function is now shared to varying 
degrees by three separate entities--Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, Office of Investigative Agency Policy [OIAP], 
and OCDEF.
    More than 27 percent of the requested funding provided in 
this account goes to support the operations of Federal agencies 
outside the Department of Justice. As part of the Committee's 
comprehensive truth-in-budgeting initiative, bill language is 
included which stipulates that this will be the final Federal 
payment to this account. This action is intended to force the 
Office of Management and Budget to follow the Committee's 1996 
recommendation and move the resources provided in this account 
to the participating agencies' budgets in the fiscal year 1998 
budget to: (1) eliminate duplication and overlap of 
administrative costs; (2) ensure that to the extent possible 
money provided for law enforcement is directed to those at the 
front line in the fight against crime; and (3) more accurately 
reflect each agency's role in the Federal crime-fighting 
efforts.
    The request would provide $74,314,000 to the Treasury 
Department, $625,000 to the Coast Guard, and $1,507,000 for an 
administrative office. The recommendation would freeze Justice 
accounts at fiscal year 1996 levels and reduce support for 
these non-Justice agencies by 10 percent. Funding for the 
administrative office is intended to provide for closeout 
costs.
    In addition, the Committee recommends bill language, 
similar to that included in previous appropriations acts, 
which: (1) allows for intergovernmental agreements; (2) makes 
$50,000,000 available until expended; (3) allows funds to be 
used under existing authorities available to participating 
organizations; and (4) allows the Attorney General to 
reallocate unobligated balances among participating 
organizations.

                                                           2,650,653,000

    The Committee recommendation provides $2,691,353,000 in 
budgetary resources for Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] 
operations for fiscal year 1997. The total includes $40,700,000 
in end-of-year carryover balances, a direct appropriation of 
$2,295,453,000, $195,200,000 in defense discretionary funding 
for counterterrorism, counterintelligence and national security 
activities, and $160,000,000 from the violent crime reduction 
trust fund pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death 
Penalty Act of 1996, Public Law 104-132 and the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-322. 
This operating level is $368,270,000 above the appropriation 
for the current year.
    Comprehensive counterterrorism initiative.--The Committee 
recommendation includes more than $195,200,000 to support and 
enhance the FBI's investigative capabilities in responding to 
major terrorism incidents and activities around the world. In 
addition to increases provided in the Department of Justice 
counterterrorism fund, the recommendation contains an increase 
of $92,855,000 in defense discretionary resources for enhanced 
counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence, and other 
national security related activities which include:
    Hazmat/chemical/biological/nuclear terrorism.--18 positions 
and $7,516,000 to establish staff capability within the FBI 
Laboratory to respond to terrorism and other situations 
involving hazardous materials [hazmat], chemical and biological 
agents, and nuclear materials; purchase necessary protective 
equipment, chemical and biological agent detection equipment, 
specialized shipping containers, laboratory equipment, health/
safety equipment, training, and research/development.
    Counterterrorism investigations.--$18,276,000, 108 
additional agents, and 123 additional support positions, as 
requested, to address growing domestic and international 
counterterrorism caseloads.
    Computer Intrusion/Threat Assessment Center [CITAC].--
$7,516,000 and 70 positions to establish and equip a center to 
identify, investigate and counter illegal electronic intrusion 
into government computer networks and the National Information 
Infrastructure.
    Bomb Data Center/arson profiling.--$1,405,000 for the FBI 
Laboratory Bomb Data Center to improve training provided to 
State and local public safety personnel at the hazardous 
devices school and to acquire advanced tools, crime scene gear, 
and related materials.
    Legal attache expansions.--$1,172,000 for the cost of 
opening new FBI legal attache [legatt] offices in Riyadh, Kiev, 
Tallinn, Warsaw, and Pretoria. The costs for staffing and 
operations of these new offices, the four new offices opened in 
fiscal year 1996 (Beijing, Cairo, Islamabad, Tel Aviv), and 
expansion of the existing legatt office in Moscow are to be 
provided from base funding provided to the FBI. The Committee 
recommendation is consistent with the FBI legal attache 
deployment plan developed jointly by the Departments of Justice 
and State and approved by the Committee on July 18, 1996.
    Computer analysis response teams.--$1,180,000 to establish 
and outfit computer analysis response teams in FBI field 
offices.
    Counterterrorism support staff.--$1,427,000 and 41 
positions to provide clerical and administrative support to 
agents, intelligence research specialists, and non-FBI 
personnel assigned to the FBI's Counterterrorism Branch.
    Annualization of counterterrorism staff hired in fiscal 
year 1996.--$22,285,000.
    The recommendation also includes the following crime-
fighting initiatives: an increase of $14,289,000, 137 positions 
and 69 FTE's, from the violent crime reduction trust fund for a 
joint FBI/DEA initiative targeting the four most significant 
Mexican drug trafficking organizations; an increase of 
$5,764,000, 176 positions and 88 FTE's, double the request, for 
safe streets task forces; an increase of $5,725,000, 2 
positions and 1 FTE, as requested, to continue working with the 
Federal law enforcement wireless users group to develop a 
national public/law enforcement public safety network; an 
increase of $3,327,000, 129 positions and 65 FTE's, as 
requested, for additional Freedom of Information and Privacy 
Act [FOIPA] declassifications staff to work down the existing 
backlog of FOIPA requests; an increase of $20,240,000, for the 
national instant criminal background check system; and 
$9,500,000 for grants to States to establish, develop, update, 
or upgrade computerized identification systems that are 
compatible with NCIC, DNA forensic laboratories, or automated 
fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with 
IAFIS.
    Hiring delays.--Over the past 2 years, Congress has made 
increasing Federal law enforcement staffing a funding priority. 
Because of the administration's failure to meet increased 
staffing targets provided by Congress for fiscal year 1996, the 
Department of Justice now estimates that the FBI will not spend 
$17,000,000 of the $22,500,000 provided in the 1995 
counterterrorism supplemental, Public Law 104-19, to hire 427 
additional support staff. For similar reasons, the FBI will not 
be able to spend an additional $23,700,000 in funds provided by 
Congress in the fiscal year 1996 appropriation to increase 
onboard FBI staff. As a result of these hiring delays, the 
Committee believes that $40,700,000 in requested funds will not 
be needed to maintain current FBI operations and onboard 
staffing levels.
    Directed use of unexpended counterterrorism funds.--Of the 
aforementioned $17,000,000 in unused counterterrorism funding, 
the Committee directs that these resources be expended in 
fiscal year 1996 for the following one-time costs in support of 
the FBI's counterterrorism activities: $9,000,000 for enhanced 
security equipment for FBI field offices; $1,200,000 for two 
mobile/deployable evidence response team laboratories; 
$2,400,000 for 12 evidence response team trailers; $3,000,000 
for advanced render-safe response team equipment; and 
$1,400,000 for development and deployment of a hazardous 
response forensic data base.
    National Crime Information Center 2000 [NCIC 2000].--Since 
1991, Congress has provided a total of $400,000,000 to upgrade 
the 26-year-old NCIC system which is managed by the FBI and 
used by more than 72,000 local, State, and Federal agencies. 
NCIC is a critical online law enforcement data base that 
routinely handles between 1 and 4,000,000 transactions per day. 
A contract was awarded in March 1993 for the development of the 
new system with an expected initial operating capacity in March 
1995. The FBI now advises that: (1) the cost for completing 
this project will be $104,200,000 more than originally 
estimated; and (2) deployment will be over 3\1/2\ years behind 
schedule. Last year, the Committee called this situation to the 
attention of the FBI Director and the Attorney General, urged 
that this project become a top management priority within the 
Department, and demanded that the FBI provide quarterly 
progress reports to the Committee on the status of this 
project. Congressional scrutiny has dramatically improved the 
management and direction of this project over the past several 
months.
    One of the factors contributing to delays and cost 
increases has been the failure on the part of the FBI and the 
users of the system to finalize the baseline requirements of 
the NCIC 2000 system. The Committee is pleased that on June 12, 
1996, the Criminal Justice Identification Services Advisory 
Policy Board [CJISAPB] representing users of the NCIC system 
agreed to defer further changes to NCIC until NCIC 2000 
development is complete. The budget request would add two new 
files--criminal aliens and protective orders--to the NCIC 2000 
at a cost of $8,250,000. The recommendation includes funding 
for incorporation of the requested capabilities into the 
development of NCIC 2000 on the two conditions. First, these 
are to be the last changes to the system until NCIC 2000 is 
fully operational. Additional requirements, no matter how 
appealing, will only increase taxpayer costs and lead to 
further delays. Second, this is to be the last appropriation 
for development of NCIC 2000. Any further cost over-runs are to 
be absorbed within the operating budget of the FBI subject to 
the reprogramming procedures outlined in section 605 of this 
act.
    Integrated automated fingerprint system [IAFIS].--Since 
1992, Congress has provided a total of $400,000,000 to develop 
a reliable electronic fingerprint data base and searching 
system for Federal, State, and local law enforcement. The 
initial proposal for development of this system projected that 
IAFIS would cost $520,500,000 and that the system would be 
operational in early 1999. Last year, the Committee noted that 
while the FBI had entered into contracts on each of four 
components of this system, the Bureau's failure to develop an 
adequate integration strategy meant there was little assurance 
that the system would function when the segments were 
completed. While the Committee is pleased that the FBI has 
worked to correct that problem, as of March 19, 1996, the FBI 
estimated that completion of the IAFIS project will be 
$119,500,000 over-budget and more than 1 year behind schedule. 
Neither of these estimates reflect adjustments for an 
incremental development approach that are currently being 
negotiated. Revised estimates are expected shortly.
    The President's budget assumes that a total of $92,200,000 
will be provided for IAFIS in fiscal year 1997. While the 
Committee recommendation continues requested funding to avoid 
further delays, the FBI is on notice that this Committee will 
not tolerate additional cost increases or further delays on 
this important project. Any future cost increases are to be 
funded from FBI base operations subject to the reprogramming 
procedures outlined in section 605 of this act.
    The Committee expects the FBI to continue providing the 
House and Senate Appropriations Committees with quarterly 
progress reports on these two projects. The Committee is aware 
that the FBI currently projects that as a result of hiring 
delays it will not utilize $23,700,000 of FTE (5 agents and 266 
support staff) as a result of lapses in hiring support staff 
positions provided in the 1995 Oklahoma City counterterrorism 
supplements (Public Law 104-19). Rather than permit the FBI to 
utilize those resources for other purposes, the recommendation 
directs that these funds be transferred into the Department of 
Justice working capital fund to finance completion of the NCIC 
2000 project and help cover cost over-runs on IAFIS.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous appropriations acts, which allows: 
(1) for purchase of passenger vehicles without regard to 
general purchase price limitations, and the acquisition and 
operation of aircraft; (2) up to $70,000 for unforeseen 
emergencies; (3) up to $50,000,000 for ADP, telecommunications, 
and technical equipment, and up to $1,000,000 for undercover 
operations to remain available until September 30, 1997; (4) 
not less than $195,200,000 for counterterrorism investigations, 
foreign counterintelligence, and national security activities; 
(5) up to $88,400,000 to remain available until expended; (6) 
up to $10,000,000 to reimburse State and local police for 
assistance related to violent crime, terrorism, and drug 
investigations; and (7) up to $45,000 for official reception 
and representation expenses.
    New language is included freezing FBI legislative and 
public affairs at fiscal year 1995 levels.
    While bill language specifying the amount for the 
fingerprint identification system is no longer included, the 
Committee expects that of the resources provided, $74,400,000 
will be used for expenses related to automation of fingerprint 
identification services. Any change to this amount requires 
notification to the Committee pursuant to reprogramming 
requirements outlined in section 605.

Committee Recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The Committee recommendation does not include direct 
appropriation for the Telecommunications Carrier Compliance 
Program. The request included $100,000,000 to reimburse 
equipment manufacturers and telecommunications support services 
for implementation of the Communications Assistance for Law 
Enforcement Act of 1994 [CALEA].
    CALEA authorizes appropriations of $500,000,000 for the 
Attorney General to pay telecommunications carriers for the 
costs directly associated with modifying their existing 
equipment, services, and facilities to allow law enforcement to 
conduct court-authorized wiretaps. The pace of technological 
change in the telecommunications industry poses an enormous 
challenge to law enforcement in its efforts to monitor 
increasingly sophisticated criminal operations. The FBI and 
national security agencies face similar challenges in their 
conduct of foreign counterintelligence and terrorism 
investigations in the United States.
    While the Committee recognized that digital telephony was a 
top law enforcement priority in fiscal year 1996, it chose to 
deny funding. At that time, the FBI confidently asserted that 
the industry's compliance costs for CALEA requirements would 
not exceed $500,000,000, but industry estimates of their costs 
of complying with new FBI capacity and capability requirements 
ran as high as $1,800,000,000. Over the past year, the 
Committee pressured the FBI to work more closely with industry 
representatives to develop a more rational, reasonable, and 
cost-effective approach toward CALEA implementation. While 
progress has been made, the FBI's poor track record of 
delivering high-tech contracts on-time and on-budget precludes 
the Committee from recommending direct appropriations for this 
fund this year.
    Instead, the Committee--like the House--has chosen to 
establish a new telecommunications carrier compliance fund 
[TCCF]. Since law enforcement, national security agencies and 
the intelligence community all have a stake in this issue, each 
is authorized to transfer unobligated balances that are 
available until expended into this fund, subject to applicable 
reprogramming requirements, for the purpose of providing 
reimbursement to telecommunications carriers for CALEA 
implementation.
    In addition, the Committee directs that of the balances 
which will be deposited in the working capital fund at the 
Department of Justice in October 1996, $10,000,000 are to be 
transferred to the TCCF to help finance the first phase of the 
FBI's current CALEA deployment plan.

Committee recommendation

                                                              28,144,000

    The Committee recommends $28,144,000 from the violent crime 
reduction trust fund, as authorized by section 811 of the 
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public 
Law 104-132), for construction for the FBI.
    The recommendation includes the following:
    FBI laboratory construction.--$21,889,000 as the second 
installment toward completion of the laboratory. The Committee 
notes that the initial $150,200,000 cost estimate for 
construction of the laboratory included $22,000,000 for site 
acquisition. On June 4, 1996, FBI Director Freeh reported to 
the Committee that: ``a definite site has been selected for 
construction of the new FBI laboratory. It will be located on 
FBI property at the FBI Academy at Quantico, VA.'' As a result 
of this decision, site acquisition funds will no longer be 
needed to complete the proposed facility. Discrepancies among 
cost estimates for completion of the laboratory have persuaded 
the Committee to withhold funding sufficient to complete this 
facility at this time. The Committee urges the Department of 
Justice to review current design options and submit a 
construction plan with cost estimates and a time line for 
completion of this facility by no later than October 15, 1996. 
The balance needed to complete this critical facility should be 
included in the fiscal year 1998 budget request.
    FBI headquarters renovations.--$2,968,000 to begin planned 
renovations of space vacated by the relocation of the Criminal 
Justice Information Services Division.
    FBI practical problems training course.--$2,000,000 for 
expansion of the practical problems training course at the FBI 
Academy.
    Necessary maintenance/upgrades.--$1,287,000, as requested, 
for the FBI Academy located at Quantico, VA.

Committee recommendation

                                                             976,824,000

    The Committee recommends total budget authority of 
$976,824,000 for Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA] salaries 
and expenses for fiscal year 1997, of which $52,824,000 is 
derived from the diversion control fund, and $172,000,000 is 
derived from the violent crime reduction trust fund for 
activities authorized by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death 
Penalty Act of 1996, Public Law 104-132 and the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-322.
    The recommendation includes an additional $36,306,000 in a 
new DEA ``Construction'' account.
    The recommendation does not include $71,000,000 by transfer 
from the Community Oriented Policing Services [COPS] Program as 
proposed by the House.
    In recent years, DEA support personnel and infrastructure 
resources have failed to keep pace with the growing complexity 
and sophistication of drug trafficking and distribution 
operations. The Committee recommendation attempts to give DEA 
the tools it needs to properly wage the war on drugs.
    The Committee is concerned that over the past 2 years, the 
administration has failed to fully utilize increased resources 
provided to DEA on a bipartisan basis to fight the war on 
drugs. In 1995, Congress provided over 300 additional DEA 
agents to restore agent staffing to peak levels before the 
hiring freeze proposed by the administration in 1993. At the 
end of 1995, only 70 additional agents had been hired. 
According to information provided to the Committee by DEA, in 
June 1996, DEA faced a hiring shortfall of 109 special agents 
and 42 diversion investigators. The Committee directs that DEA 
make the hiring and training of these critically needed 
positions its top management priority.
    Comprehensive counternarcotics initiative.--The startling 
increase in teenage drug use and the increasing availability of 
drugs in the United States since 1992 has prompted the 
Committee, within an allocation that is more than 
$3,700,000,000 lower than the President's request, to provide 
more total resources to DEA than recommended by the President. 
The Committee's drug control initiative includes additional 
resources to increase infrastructure and training capacity in a 
new DEA ``Construction'' account.
    In addition to funds provided to maintain current 
operations and staffing levels at DEA, the Committee 
recommendation for the ``Salaries and expenses'' account 
contains the following increases.
    Enhanced investigation, intelligence, and drug interdiction 
efforts.--$10,000,000 for a cooperative effort with the FBI to 
penetrate command and control communications of Mexican drug 
trafficking organizations; $8,131,000 and 50 agents for 
investigations from court-approved title III wiretaps; 
$2,394,000, 4 agents, and 15 diversion investigators to focus 
on methamphetamine activity along the Southwest border; 
$5,900,000 to complete the planned expansion of the Mobile 
Enforcement Team [MET's] Program and an additional $4,000,000 
for a new MET's initiative focusing on drug problems in rural 
areas; $632,000 and 3 positions, as requested, to open a 
country office in Pretoria, South Africa as part of DEA's 
heroin strategy; and $4,133,000 and 14 positions for a 
requested joint classified intelligence project with FBI and 
the Department of Justice.
    Equipping DEA to combat sophisticated drug trafficking 
organizations.--$2,750,000 to purchase microwave intelligence 
gathering system [MIGS] equipment for improved surveillance 
operations; $1,124,000 to purchase modern tracking equipment 
critical to long-range surveillance of vehicles, ships, and 
aircraft; $7,000,000 to purchase wireless radio equipment for 
DEA domestic offices; $3,000,000 to procure new digital 
intercept equipment to convert two division offices to the new 
technology; $14,425,000 for ADP system upgrades, including 
$4,425,000 for Project MERLIN and $6,867,000 for FIREBIRD; 
$2,000,000 to purchase aircraft and replacement parts; 
$5,036,000 to purchase replacement vehicles; $3,500,000 for ADP 
equipment and maintenance; $1,500,000 for laboratory equipment; 
and $8,500,000 to redeploy DEA agents where they are most 
needed.
    In addition, the Committee directs that $3,500,000 of 
unobligated balances in the working capital fund at the 
Department of Justice be made available to support 
implementation of the FIREBIRD project.
    Drug diversion control fee account.--The recommendation 
includes $52,824,000 for DEA's Drug Diversion Control Program 
for fiscal year 1997, the full amount requested and $4,329,000 
above the 1996 funding level. The Drug Diversion Control 
Program targets the diversion, distribution, manufacture, and 
abuse of legitimate pharmaceuticals. DEA annually registers 
more than 900,000 drug handlers, of these, more than 1,670 are 
manufacturers, distributors, importers, exporters, and others 
who handle large volumes of controlled substances. Registrants 
pay fees which fully support the cost of this program.
    Operation Alliance.--The recommendation maintains funding 
for Operation Alliance at the fiscal year 1996 level. This 
operation is a multiagency entity whose primary mission is to 
facilitate and improve coordination of drug-related law 
enforcement organizations operating in the Southwest.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous appropriations acts, which allows: 
(1) up to $70,000 for unforeseen emergencies; (2) for expenses 
for drug education and training; (3) purchase of passenger 
vehicles without regard to general purchase price limitations, 
and acquisition and operation of aircraft; (4) up to $1,800,000 
for research and up to $15,000,000 for transfer to the ``Drug 
diversion control fee'' account to remain available until 
expended; (5) up to $4,000,000 for evidence and information, up 
to $4,000,000 for contracting for ADP and telecommunications, 
$4,000,000 for technical equipment, and up to $2,000,000 for 
laboratory equipment to remain available until September 30, 
1998; and (6) up to $50,000 for official reception and 
representation expenses.
    New language is included freezing DEA legislative and 
public affairs at fiscal year 1995 levels.

Committee recommendation

                                                             $36,306,000

    The Committee recommends establishing a new 
``Construction'' account for DEA to finance needed 
infrastructure improvements and renovations.
    The recommendation includes $7,000,000 requested in the 
``Salaries and expenses'' account for renovations to DEA's 
forensic laboratory facilities. In addition, the Committee 
recommends $29,306,000 to complete the Justice Training Center 
to be located at the FBI Academy at Quantico, VA; $11,200,000 
had been provided previously for facility design and site 
preparation. When completed, this new facility will enable DEA 
to conduct the bulk of its domestic and international training 
onsite at the FBI academy, and free up additional classroom and 
office space occupied by DEA at current Academy facilities. Any 
increase in construction costs above the amounts provided for 
this facility are to be absorbed within base DEA operations. 
Funding is provided from the violent crime reduction trust fund 
as authorized by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty 
Act of 1996, Public Law 104-132, to expand the instructional, 
operational support, and construction of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation Academy and the Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-322.

                                                           1,029,991,000

    The Committee recommends total new budget (obligational) 
authority of $3,009,157,000 for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service [INS] for fiscal year 1997. This is a 
net increase of $451,687,000 over the current fiscal year, 
$57,751,000 less than the request, and $87,751,000 less than 
the House allowance. Of the total amount recommended, 
$539,476,000 is derived from the violent crime reduction trust 
fund, as authorized in the Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-322, and the 
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Public 
Law 104-132, and $1,029,991,000 will be derived from offsetting 
fee collections.
    Realignment of fee-supported expenditures to support 
congressional priorities.--The recommendation includes a major 
realignment of resources within the ``Immigration examinations 
fee'' and ``Immigration user fee'' accounts to support 
congressional immigration priorities and free up appropriated 
funds for increased border enforcement and detention/
deportation of illegal aliens at levels above those contained 
in the request. Rather than increase fees to accomplish this 
goal, the Committee has chosen to draw down planned end-of-year 
carryover funds in these accounts.
    Emphasis on enforcement.--Recognizing the Federal 
Government's responsibility for enforcing our immigration laws, 
Congress has increased funding for INS by over 74 percent since 
1993. In fiscal year 1996, the Congress provided the largest 
increase ever provided to the INS--a $558,000,000, or a 27-
percent, increase. In fiscal year 1996, additional resources 
were provided for over 3,000 new INS personnel, including 1,400 
more personnel on the front lines of the border, and 1,500 more 
investigations and detention and deportation personnel to 
locate, apprehend, and remove illegal aliens from the United 
States. The recommendation for fiscal year 1997 includes 
$308,270,000 in program increases for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service which emphasize stopping illegal 
immigration at our borders and ensuring that persons who have 
entered the country illegally are detained and deported. The 
increases provide for over 2,100 new INS personnel--over 1,000 
more personnel on the front lines of the border, including 900 
new Border Patrol agents, and 150 new land border inspectors, 
and over 199 more investigations and detention and deportation 
personnel to locate, apprehend, and remove illegal aliens from 
the United States. The recommendation provides a total of 1,700 
additional detention beds, 1,000 more than requested, to detain 
illegal aliens.
    The Committee's recommendations for specific accounts 
within the INS are described in more detail below.

                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES

                     (including transfer of funds)

Appropriations, 1996....................................  $1,711,023,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................   2,142,082,000
House allowance.........................................   2,167,782,000

Committee recommendation

                                                           1,973,625,000

    The Committee recommendation provides a total of 
$1,973,625,000 for INS salaries and expenses, including 
$539,476,000 from the violent crime reduction trust fund as 
authorized in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1994, Public Law 103-322, and the Antiterrorism and 
Effective Death Penalty Act, Public Law 104-132.
    Base transfer to immigration examinations fee.--The 
recommendation transfers base funding for the Information and 
Records Management Program, a total of $56,525,000, to the 
``Immigration examinations fee'' account in order to free up 
additional resources for higher priority border control, 
deportation, and detention initiatives. The immigration 
examinations fee may be used for expenses in providing 
immigration adjudication and naturalization services and 
support.
    Comprehensive immigration initiative.--In addition to funds 
required to maintain current operations and onboard staffing 
levels, the Committee recommendation includes the following:
    Border control.--A total increase of 1,160 positions, 472 
FTE's and $148,467,000 from the violent crime reduction trust 
fund is recommended to enhance border control, including:
  +$107,608,000 for 900 new Border Patrol agents and 110 
        support personnel, instead of 700 new agents as 
        requested by the administration;
  +$27,093,000 for infrared scopes, low light television 
        systems, sensors and the replacement of three 
        helicopters, including upgraded forward-looking 
        infrared systems;
  +$1,466,000 for international antismuggling activities; and
  +$12,300,000 for 150 new land border inspectors for the 
        Southern border.
    The Committee is aware of technology advances that are 
currently available that would enhance border control 
activities. Within the overall amount recommended for border 
automation and technology, the Committee has provided 
$7,000,000 more than the requested amount for additional 
investments in force multiplying technology to be deployed 
along the Southwest border. In addition to night vision 
goggles, low light television, and other technologies currently 
deployed along the border, the Committee expects the INS to 
examine the use of smart multisensor acquisition and remote 
transmitting system [SMARTS] technology, a network of sensor 
packages and communication repeaters that can monitor large, 
sparsely populated regions of the United States-Mexico border, 
and thermal imaging sensor upgrades for Border Patrol 
helicopters. Allocation of these additional resources is 
subject to the reprogramming procedures as outlined in section 
605 of this act.
    Detention and removal of deportable aliens.--The Committee 
is concerned that despite increased resources and efforts by 
INS to locate and apprehend illegal aliens residing in the 
United States, the illegal alien population continues to grow. 
Congressional efforts to identify, apprehend, detain, and 
deport illegal aliens have been undercut by a lack of detention 
resources that are critical to INS's ability to remove aliens 
from the United States. The Committee is deeply concerned that 
the administration's immigration initiative provides 
insufficient resources for detaining aliens that have been 
apprehended and/or issued orders for deportation, to ensure 
their removal. A report issued in March 1996 by the Department 
of Justice Office of Inspector General found that only 11 
percent of illegal aliens who are ordered deported by INS, but 
are not detained, are actually removed from the United States.
    The Committee recommendation, therefore, places greater 
emphasis on providing adequate detention resources than 
requested by the administration. The recommendation provides 
increases of $77,781,000 for additional deportation personnel 
and a 1,700-bed increase in detention capacity (1,000 more than 
requested by the administration). These additional resources 
are necessary to ensure the removal of deportable aliens and 
address increased detention requirements resulting from 
implementation of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
    Since providing detention and deportation services for 
excludable aliens is an allowed use of the immigration user 
fee, the Committee has decided to shift the bulk of the 
recommended increases for alien detention and deportation--
$56,056,000--to that account. Within the ``Salaries and 
expenses'' account, the recommendation provides an increase of 
$21,725,000, 500 beds, 24 detention officers, and 12 FTE's from 
the violent crime reduction trust fund for detention and 
removal of deportable aliens.
    Infrastructure.--The Committee recommendation also includes 
$35,069,000 from the violent crime reduction trust fund for 
increased infrastructure improvements, including:
  +$14,070,000 for replacement of obsolete radios;
  +$14,000,000 for replacement of vehicles and buses;
  +$1,619,000 to upgrade the Security Program in INS, provide 
        followup on audit and field assessment findings, and 
        expand the legal proceedings portion of the 
        Institutional Hearing Program; and
  +$5,380,000 for training to support long-range career 
        development of journeymen employees.
    The recommendation includes language requested by the 
Department of Justice completing the transfer of the Cuban 
Haitian resettlement program from the Community Relations 
Service to this account.

Offsetting fee collections

    The Committee recommends a total of $1,029,991,000 in 
expenditures from fee-funded accounts, an increase of 
$208,544,000 over the current year, to support activities 
related to the legal admission of persons into the United 
States. These activities are supported entirely by fees paid by 
persons who are either traveling internationally or are 
applying for immigration benefits. The recommended increases 
occur in two major fee-funded accounts: immigration 
examinations fee and immigrations users fee. In both cases, the 
INS's most recent end-of-year carryover balance estimates were 
significantly higher than proposed in the President's budget. 
The following increases are recommended:

                         Immigration user fees

    An anticipated increase of $32,477,000 in revenues from 
persons paying fees on international flights or sea travel will 
support an increase of $12,171,000 needed to maintain current 
operations and onboard staffing levels. The Committee 
recommendation also includes the following program increases:
    Increased inspections.--$12,649,000 and 153 positions for 
airport inspections staffing for increased border control and 
facilitation at existing airports throughout the United States; 
$2,479,000 and 30 positions to staff two new airports in 
Hawaii; and $2,491,000 and 15 positions for a preinspection 
program in Ottawa, Canada.
    Expanded detention and deportation.--$5,000,000 for 
expansion of the interior repatriation program started in San 
Diego this fiscal year; $4,000,000 for the port court 
initiative; $3,000,000 for enhancements to the justice prisoner 
alien transportation system [JPATS]; $32,147,000 to activate 
1,200 detention beds, 500 more than requested by the 
administration; $3,970,000, 28 positions and 14 FTE's to expand 
the Institutional Hearing Program; and $7,213,000, 40 positions 
and 20 FTE's to implement the local jail initiative.

                     Immigration examinations fees

    The Committee recommendation includes $586,800,000 of 
spending from offsetting collections from persons applying for 
immigration benefits. In addition to shifting base funding for 
information resources management [IRM]--$56,525,000--from 
salaries and expenses to this account, the recommendation 
includes the following program increases:
    Handling increased caseload.--$3,597,000 to continue 
temporary staffing in Miami, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, 
and San Francisco to handle naturalization caseloads; 
$2,246,000 to continue temporary staffing in Miami, Newark, New 
York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco to handle adjustment of 
status case processing; $3,600,000 for FBI fingerprint checks; 
$2,217,000 to fund court costs for naturalization ceremonies; 
$6,591,000 to support the service center direct mail records 
contract; and $4,819,000 to continue the pilot records contract 
currently ongoing in Miami, Los Angeles, and Chicago District 
offices.
    Enhanced immigration investigations and support.--
$1,279,000 for antismuggling efforts; $2,244,000, 23 positions, 
and 11 FTE's to expand the identification of criminal aliens in 
local jails; $4,164,000, 17 positions, and 5 FTE's to expand 
the Institutional Hearing Program; $726,000 for increased 
equipment for INS investigators; $3,325,000 for the Law 
Enforcement Support Center; $7,576,000 for ADP contract 
support; and $490,000 to enhance the Computer Security Program.
    These increases are financed by reducing projected end-of-
year carryover balances in this account from $92,400,000 to 
$17,400,000.

                      Land border inspection fees

    The Committee recommendation includes $11,054,000 in 
spending from the land border inspection fund, an increase of 
$4,149,000 over the current year, to support activities related 
to land border fee pilot projects. The current revenues 
generated in this account are from dedicated commuter lanes in 
Blaine and Port Roberts, WA, Detroit Tunnel and Ambassador 
Bridge, Michigan, and Otay Mesa, CA. The additional resources 
in 1997 will be for five additional dedicated commuter lanes in 
El Paso, Laredo, and Hidalgo, TX; and Nogales and San Luis, AZ, 
and experimenting with various automation technology to 
facilitate the inspection process. The Committee recommendation 
includes language that extends these pilot projects through 
September 30, 1999. In addition, language is included that 
allows for the implementation of these projects in other States 
on the southern border, including California, but prohibits the 
collection of a universal border crossing fee.
    Peace Arch Crossing Entry [PACE] Program.--The Committee 
recognizes that the PACE dedicated commuter lane has been a 
major success in easing congestion and improving the local and 
regional economic development at the Blaine, WA, Port of 
Entry--the third busiest border crossing between the United 
States and Canada. The Committee also recognizes that the 
Washington State Department of Transportation has dedicated 
$2,700,000 in State transportation funds--conditioned on a 
Federal match--to widen the Pacific Highway crossing from two 
lanes to four lanes and lengthen the PACE lane on Interstate 5. 
The United States/Canada Shared Border Accord has resulted in 
an expansion by Canada of the CANPASS/PACE Program to other 
highway, airport, and marine ports of entry in the Lower 
Mainland of British Columbia adjacent to Blaine, WA, and 
Whatcom County.
    The Committee encourages INS to work with the Cascadia 
Cross-Border Working Group to expand the PACE Program on the 
United States side to match the Canadian program enhancements 
pursuant to the goals of the accord. To provide resources for 
this expansion, the Committee encourages the INS to direct 75 
percent of the funds collected locally by the PACE Program to 
the Northwest region.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous appropriations acts, which allows: 
(1) up to $50,000 to meet unforeseen emergencies and up to 
$5,000 to be used for official reception and representation 
expenses; (2) for the purchase of motor vehicles for police-
type use and for uniforms, without regard to general purchase 
price limitations; (3) for the acquisition and operation of 
aircraft and for immigration-related research; (4) up to 
$400,000 for research to be available until expended; (5) up to 
$30,000 to be paid to individual employees for overtime; (6) up 
to $10,000,000 for basic officer training; (7) up to $5,000,000 
for payments to State and local law enforcement agencies 
engaged in cooperative activities related to immigration; and 
(8) funds in this act or any other act to be used for the 
continued operation of the San Clemente and Temecula 
checkpoints unless the checkpoints are open and traffic is 
being checked on a continuous 24-hour basis.
    Deployment of resources.--The Committee expects that INS 
will continue to deploy new Border Patrol agent and inspector 
positions to support the greatest areas of illegal traffic. The 
Committee expects this personnel to be assigned to the front 
lines on the immediate border and on primary inspection lanes 
to facilitate traffic across the border. The Committee also 
expects INS to review the requirements of States and localities 
in the central and western region of the country in its 
allocation of additional personnel to detain and remove illegal 
aliens, especially criminal aliens involved in criminal 
activities such as drug trafficking. Furthermore, the Committee 
expects continued consultation on redeployment initiatives 
started in fiscal year 1996. The Committee directs INS to 
consult with the Appropriations Committees of both the House 
and the Senate before a final allocation of these agents is 
determined.
    In determining distribution of additional INS agents, the 
Committee requests that the INS provide special consideration 
to placing additional special agents in Nebraska. Nebraska is 
in a unique situation with regard to immigration because of the 
size of the meatpacking industry. With 222 meatpacking plants, 
Nebraska is a major draw for those seeking illegal employment. 
Because I-80, which runs the length of Nebraska, is a major 
pipeline for illegal immigrants. The Committee believes that 
increased special agents enforcing the law along I-80 will 
benefit other States.
    Report on removals of criminal and noncriminal aliens.--The 
Committee is aware that INS has revised its estimate for 
removals of criminal aliens during fiscal year 1996 from 
110,000 to 62,000. While this level still reflects an increase 
in removals over the 50,000 removals accomplished in 1995, the 
Committee was led to believe that when it provided $129,000,000 
in additional resources in fiscal year 1996 to detain and 
deport criminal and illegal aliens, removals of aliens who are 
illegal residing in the United States, would significantly 
increase. The Committee expects that with the additional 
resources included in the recommendation, INS should exceed its 
estimate of 93,000 removals for fiscal year 1997. The Committee 
directs the INS to submit a quarterly report on removals 
beginning no later than January 1, 1997, that outlines the 
number of removals in the following categories: criminal aliens 
removed; noncriminal aliens removed; port court removals; and 
the number of outstanding final orders of deportation or 
exclusion.
    INS management reforms.--The Committee is deeply troubled 
by information suggesting that INS is currently shifting tens 
of millions of dollars within INS accounts in violation of 
legal reprogramming requirements. This is precisely the kind of 
activity that led the INS in past years to misappropriate tens 
of millions of dollars to GSA rent that Congress had intended 
for Border Patrol hiring and training. The Committee directs 
the Attorney General to review this situation immediately, 
recommend corrective action, and report her findings to the 
Committee by no later than September 15, 1996. In addition, the 
Committee is aware of a recent investigation by the Department 
of Justice Office of the Inspector General regarding deception 
by INS senior officials of the congressional task force on 
immigration reform's factfinding visit to the Miami District in 
June 1995. The Committee concurs with the House action to 
transfer $1,000,000 from INS legislative and public affairs to 
the inspector general. This reduction shall have no effect on 
casework capabilities within INS.

                              Construction

    The Committee recommends $5,541,000 for construction 
projects for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the 
same as the amount requested. Of the amount recommended, 
$4,441,000 will provide for removal of leaking underground fuel 
storage tanks at INS-owned facilities, and $1,100,000 will 
support health and safety code improvements at the Port Isabel 
detention facility.

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................  $2,567,578,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................   2,887,816,000

Committee recommendation

                                                           2,768,316,000

    The Committee recommends total budgetary resources of 
$2,883,540,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Federal 
prison system for fiscal year 1996, including $25,224,000 from 
the violent crime reduction trust fund, $2,768,316,000 from 
discretionary appropriations, and $90,000,000 in end-of-year 
carryover balances.
    The Committee recommendation includes an increase of 
$254,998,000 needed to maintain current operations and on-board 
staffing levels within the Bureau of Prisons [BOP].
    Activation of new prisons.--The Committee understands that 
because of delays in scheduled activations for 1997 the 
appropriation required for the Federal prison system can be 
reduced by $30,000,000 without affecting requested program 
levels. According to information provided to the Committee by 
the BOP on July 17, 1996, the Bureau anticipates $90,000,000 in 
funds that will carry over from fiscal year 1996 as a result of 
delays in activations of facilities that were scheduled to open 
either in 1996 or previous years. Bill language is added to 
expand the carryover authority of the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
to $90,000,000 for fiscal year 1997 and future years. This 
change is necessary to address projected growth in the number 
of Federal prison inmates within tight budgetary constraints 
and ensure that all resources within this appropriations 
account are utilized to the maximum extent possible for 
activations and other operating expenses of the Federal Prison 
System. As a result of these changes, funding required for the 
Federal prison system can be reduced by $120,000,000 below the 
request without affecting requested program levels.
    According to information provided to the Committee by the 
Bureau of Prisons on July 3, 1996, work delays that have 
already occurred will prevent planned prison expansions at 
Carswell AFB, TX, and Morgantown, WV, from accepting inmates in 
fiscal year 1997 as originally planned. In addition, activation 
of the new prison health facility located at Butner, NC, will 
be delayed until early fiscal year 1998. The recommendation 
provides initial funding to prepare these facilities for 
activation and ensure that security at these facilities is not 
compromised.
    The Committee recommendation includes $63,061,000 to 
activate the following new and expanded facilities:
  --Beaumont, TX--960 bed high security facility;
  --Edgefield, SC--1,152 bed medium security facility with a 
        512 bed minimum security camp;
  --Seattle, WA--677 bed detention facility; and
  --Elkton, OH--1,536 bed low security facility with a 512 bed 
        minimum security camp.
    In addition, the recommendation includes an increase of 
$11,724,000 in resources from the violent crime reduction trust 
fund as authorized in the Violent Crime Control and Law 
Enforcement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-322, to add 5 
residential drug treatment units, for a total of 44 programs, 
to treat between 5,000 and 6,000 Federal prison inmates with 
substance abuse problems.
    Privatization of Federal prison facilities.--The Committee 
is troubled by the administration's election-year reversal of 
the President's prison privatization initiative which would 
have privatized all future pretrial, minimum, and low security 
prisons with the exception of those which will be part of 
Federal correctional complexes. The first two facilities slated 
for privatization under that policy were to be located in Taft, 
CA. Construction of those two facilities has been completed and 
the facilities are ready to accept inmates but for the awarding 
of a contract to a private vendor by the BOP. Because of (1) 
the considerable time and expense already put forth to prepare 
for the privatization of these facilities; (2) the benefits 
that prison privatization already has demonstrated at the State 
and local level; and (3) support within that community for 
privatization, the Committee directs the Bureau of Prisons to 
undertake a 5-year prison privatization demonstration project 
involving the two Taft facilities. A demonstration project is 
needed to give the administration and Congress an opportunity 
to monitor safety and operational concerns cited by the 
Department of Justice in its June 5, 1996, letter to the 
Committee announcing its decision to reverse the President's 
privatization initiative. The Committee directs BOP to proceed 
with the immediate implementation of this demonstration 
project.
    Health care privatization demonstration project.--In fiscal 
year 1996, the Committee directed the Bureau of Prisons [BOP] 
to develop a 3-year demonstration project to evaluate 
privatization of health care services in Federal prisons. The 
Committee supports BOP's plan to implement the pilot at the 
correctional complex in Beaumont, TX. The Committee understands 
that requests for proposals have been announced, bids have been 
submitted, and are currently under review. The Committee urges 
BOP to complete bid review expeditiously in order to award a 
contract early in fiscal year 1997.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous appropriations acts, which allows: 
(1) for the purchase of motor vehicles for police-type use and 
the purchase of uniforms without regard to the general purchase 
price limitation; (2) for the provision of technical advice to 
foreign governments; (3) for transfer of funds to the Health 
Resources and Services Administration; (4) for the Director to 
enter into contracts to furnish health care; (5) up to $6,000 
for reception and representation expenses; (6) up to 
$90,000,000 as discussed above for activation of prisons to 
remain available until September 30, 1998; (7) up to 
$20,000,000 for contract confinement expenses for the care and 
security of Cuban and Haitian entrants; (8) the Federal Prison 
System to enter into contracts and other agreements with 
private entities for a multiyear period for the confinement of 
Federal prisoners; (9) the National Institute of Corrections to 
be included in this account and merges balances from prior 
years to this account. In addition, one-time language is 
deleted, as requested, that prohibited the privatization of any 
Federal prison facilities located in Forrest City, AR, and 
Yazoo City, MS.

                        Buildings And Facilities

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $334,728,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             385,700,000

    The Committee recommends a total of $385,700,000 for fiscal 
year 1997 for the construction, modernization, maintenance, and 
repair of prison and detention facilities housing Federal 
prisoners. This amount is $90,000,000 more than the budget 
request.
    Building added capacity in the Federal Prison System.--The 
Committee is concerned about the level of overcrowding in the 
Federal Prison System which, as of mid-July, is 23 percent 
above rated capacity. The October 1995 disturbances clearly 
indicate that the level of overcrowding in Federal prisons 
remains dangerously high. Under these circumstances, the 
Committee views the administration's plan, as outlined in the 
budget, for 115 percent overcrowding by 2005 as insufficient 
and irresponsible. The Committee recommendation includes 
$90,000,000 above the request for the Bureau of Prisons [BOP] 
to accelerate the planned expansion of Federal prison capacity 
by constructing one more U.S. penitentiary with a minimum 
capacity of 960 high security beds. The Committee directs BOP 
to evaluate critical space needs, review site options for the 
high security facility, and report back with its recommendation 
by no later than 30 days after this legislation is enacted. The 
Committee has provided this additional funding to address what 
it views as the greatest long-term need within BOP--adequate 
bed space for Federal inmates convicted of violent crimes. The 
recommendation reflects the Committee's strongly held view that 
building adequate prison capacity is a critical component of a 
successful crime-fighting strategy. The Committee remains 
committed to a goal of zero overcrowding in the Federal Prison 
System.
    The recommendation includes:
  --$90,000,000 for construction of a U.S. Penitentiary at a 
        site to be determined by the Bureau of Prisons;
  --$97,000,000 for the construction of a medium security 
        facility and camp at George Air Force Base, CA;
  --$50,147,000 for a Federal detention facility in Hawaii; and
  --$34,270,000 for construction of 144 additional holding 
        cells for use by the U.S. Marshals Service.
    Hawaii detention facility.--The recommendation provides 
$50,147,000 to commence design and construction of a pretrial 
detention facility in Hawaii. Given the urgent and longstanding 
need for establishing and operating this facility, as well as 
the unique nature of establishing and operating it in Hawaii, 
the Committee directs BOP to include the funds needed for 
completed construction and future operation of this facility in 
future budget submissions.
    The Committee encourages the use of local labor and 
services, where appropriate and cost effective, for the 
construction of these facilities.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous appropriations acts, which allows: 
(1) for planning, acquisition of sites, and construction of 
facilities; (2) for leasing a facility in Oklahoma City; (3) 
for acquisition, remodeling, and equipping facilities by 
contract or force account; (4) up to $14,074,000 to construct 
inmate work areas; (5) for use of prisoner labor; (6) up to 10 
percent of this appropriation to be transferred to the 
``Salaries and expenses'' account; and (7) for up to 
$36,570,000 for renovation and construction of Marshals Service 
prisoner holding facilities.

                                                               3,042,000

    The Committee recommends a limitation on administrative 
expenses of $3,042,000 for the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. 
for fiscal year 1997, which is $698,000 below the amount 
requested, $181,000 above the current year limitation, and 
identical to the House allowance.
    The Committee directs Federal Prison Industries [UNICOR] to 
continue seeking competitively bid manufacturing joint ventures 
with the private sector. It is the Committee's view that these 
efforts have not only provided UNICOR increased resources, but 
also provided prison inmates with improved job skills which 
help reduce recidivism.

    The Committee recommends a total of $3,986,555,000 in new 
budget (obligational) authority for fiscal year 1996, including 
$3,344,100,000 from the violent crime reduction trust fund, for 
the various law enforcement assistance, juvenile justice, 
research, and statistics programs of the Office of Justice 
Programs [OJP].
    Included in these amounts are funds to continue providing 
assistance to States and localities, such as the State and 
Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program, the Community 
Oriented Policing Services [COPS] Program, the violent offender 
incarceration and truth-in-sentencing incarceration grants, the 
State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, the Violence Against 
Women Grant Program, Byrne grant program, Weed and Seed 
Program, juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, and 
victims of child abuse programs.

Committee recommendation

                                                             101,629,000

    The Committee recommends $101,629,000 in direct 
appropriations for justice assistance for fiscal year 1997.
    Funding included under the violent crime reduction trust 
fund in fiscal year 1996 for Violence Against Women Act 
programs, the State prison drug treatment program and the 
Missing Alzheimer's Patient Program are included in the 
recommendation under State and local law enforcement assistance 
for fiscal year 1997.
    The funding provided for justice assistance provides 
assistance to States in the form of research, evaluation, 
statistics, information sharing, emergency assistance, missing 
children assistance and the management and administration of 
all grants provided through the Office of Justice Programs. An 
explanation of each program follows:
    National Institute of Justice.--The Committee 
recommendation provides $31,629,000 for the National Institute 
of Justice [NIJ] for fiscal year 1997, which is a $1,649,000 
increase over the current year appropriation. The increase is 
provided to support increased research, evaluation and 
demonstration programs within NIJ. In addition, $20,000,000 
will be provided to NIJ in fiscal year 1997, as was provided in 
fiscal year 1996, from the local law enforcement block grant 
for assisting local units to identify, select, develop, 
modernize, and purchase new technologies for use by law 
enforcement. NIJ is the Nation's primary source of research and 
development in the field of criminal justice. NIJ fosters 
innovation in law enforcement technologies and practices, 
investigative causes and patterns of crime, and informs the 
public of research and development findings. Within the total 
funding level provided to NIJ for fiscal year 1997, the 
Committee has provided resources for the following projects:
    Defense/justice partnership.--The Committee supports 
increased resources of $1,629,000 and 10 FTE's to provide for 
NIJ management and oversight of this program to support joint 
efforts by the Justice Department and the Department of Defense 
to adapt defense technologies to law enforcement use, field 
prototype systems for evaluation, develop standards and test 
products, and develop technologies that will minimize the risk 
of death or injury to law enforcement/corrections officers and 
citizens.
    Technology enhancements for State/local law enforcement.--
The fiscal year 1996 appropriation provided $20,000,000 for 
this purpose consistent with the local law enforcement block 
grant. Of the funds provided, the Committee understands that as 
of July 15, 1996, only $2,200,000 had been obligated. The 
Committee directs that the allowed use of the remaining fiscal 
year 1996 funds and those provided for fiscal year 1997 be 
modified to include counterterrorism technologies, computerized 
identification systems, and forensic DNA analysis technologies 
as outlined in sections 811 and 821 of the Antiterrorism and 
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Public Law 104-134.
    The Committee is aware of a number of technology 
initiatives that will enhance law enforcement capabilities. 
Within the overall amounts provided for NIJ, the Committee 
expects the Office of Justice Programs to provide an 
appropriate level of resources to be transferred to the FBI for 
continued operations of the Center of Advanced Support in 
Technology for Law Enforcement [CASTLE].
    National study on correctional health care.--In both the 
House and Senate reports accompanying the appropriations act 
for fiscal year 1996, the Committee encouraged NIJ to undertake 
a national study on health care services currently available in 
jails, prisons, and juvenile facilities. The Committee is aware 
that of the more than 11 million persons released from jails, 
prisons and juvenile correctional facilities annually, many 
carry drug-resistant tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or other 
infectious diseases that place the general public at risk. The 
Committee understands that NIJ is conducting a feasibility 
review to prioritize specific issues within the correctional 
health care arena that are in greatest need of research and 
evaluation. The Committee directs that $1,000,000 of the funds 
provided to NIJ be used to support a grant award for a national 
study on the health care status of soon-to-be-released inmates, 
which identifies problems areas, particularly as they relate to 
linkages which exist between correctional institutions and 
community health resources.
    Bureau of Justice Statistics.--The Committee recommendation 
provides $21,379,000 for the Bureau of Justice Statistics [BJS] 
for fiscal year 1997, which is the same amount provided in the 
current year appropriation. The BJS is responsible for the 
collection, analysis and publication of statistical information 
on crime, criminal offenders, victims of crime, and the 
operations of the Nation's justice systems.
    Emergency assistance.--The Committee recommendation 
provides no new budget authority for the Emergency Assistance 
Program, as requested by the Department. This program offers 
Federal assistance to States in response to situations of an 
emergency nature.
    Missing children.--The Committee recommendation provides 
$5,971,000 for the Missing Children Program for fiscal year 
1997, which is the same amount provided in the current year 
appropriation, and the full amount requested. This program 
provides funds to combat crimes against children, particularly 
kidnaping and sexual exploitation.
    Regional information sharing system.--The Committee 
recommendation provides $14,500,000 for fiscal year 1997 for 
the regional information sharing system [RISS], which is the 
same amount provided for the current year appropriation, and 
the full amount requested. The RISS program provides funds to 
maintain six regionally based information sharing centers 
throughout the United States to assist States in addressing 
major, multijurisdictional crimes.
    White Collar Crime Information Center.--The Committee 
recommends a total of $3,850,000 for the National White Collar 
Crime Center [NWCCC] for fiscal year 1997, and the full amount 
requested. This program provides assistance to State and local 
law enforcement and regulatory agencies in addressing 
multijurisdictional white collar crimes.
    Management and administration.--The Committee 
recommendation provides $24,300,000 and 300 FTE's for the 
management and administration [M&A] of the Office of Justice 
Programs. In addition, reimbursable funding will be provided 
from the ``Juvenile justice'' account, community oriented 
policing services and the violent crime reduction programs for 
the administration of grants under these activities. Total 
funding for the administration of grants is as follows:

    Edward Byrne grants to States.--The Committee 
recommendation provides $535,000,000 for the Edward Byrne 
Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, of 
which $60,000,000 is for discretionary grants and $475,000,000 
for formula grants. Of the formula grant funding recommended by 
the Committee, $175,000,000 is provided under the violent crime 
reduction trust fund as authorized under the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Public Law 103-322. 
This amount is identical to both the current year appropriation 
and the budget request. The recommendation is $25,000,000 lower 
than the House allowance.
    Discretionary grants.--The Committee recommendation 
provides $60,000,000 for discretionary grants under chapter A 
of the Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Assistance Program 
to be administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance [BJA] to 
public or private agencies and nonprofit organizations, for 
educational and training programs, technical assistance, 
improvement of State criminal justice systems, and 
demonstration projects of a multi-jurisdictional nature. Within 
the amount provided for these discretionary grants, the 
Committee expects BJA to provide:
  --$28,500,000 for the Weed and Seed Program.
    Within available resources the Committee urges BJA to 
favorably consider:
  --Continuation of the National Crime Prevention Council and 
        expansion of the National Citizens Crime Prevention 
        Campaign (McGruff);
  --Continued support for SEARCH Group, Inc. to expand and the 
        National Technical Assistance Program, which provides 
        support to State and local criminal justice agencies to 
        improve their use of computers and information 
        technology;
  --Support for the trauma reduction initiative;
  --Continuation of the National Council of Juvenile and Family 
        Courts;
  --Continuation and expansion of the Drug Abuse Resistance 
        Education [DARE AMERICA] Program;
  --Continuation of the National Judicial College;
  --Continuation of Project Return;
  --Support for victim information and notification everyday 
        [VINE]; and
  --Support for the National Night Out Program.

              Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund Programs

    Local law enforcement block grant.--The Committee 
recommendation includes $503,000,000 to continue the local law 
enforcement block grant program started last year, which 
provides grants to localities to reduce crime and improve 
public safety. By eliminating several earmarks contained in the 
1996 appropriation, the recommendation increases available 
block grant resources by $21,000,000. Of the amounts provided, 
$20,000,000 will be provided to NIJ for assisting local units 
to identify, select, develop, modernize, and purchase new 
technologies for use by law enforcement.
    The recommendation for funding for the local law 
enforcement block grant continues the commitment to provide 
local governments
with the resources and flexibility to address specific crime 
problems in their communities with their own solutions. The 
Committee notes that although this grant program was new in 
fiscal year 1996, applications for grants and estimated funding 
allocations have already been distributed to localities. The 
Committee commends the Bureau of Justice Assistance for their 
timeliness in implementation of this grant program.
    The recommendation contains bill language earmarking 
$20,000,000 of these funds for the Boys and Girls Clubs of 
America, $4,500,000 more than the total resources provided for 
this worthwhile program in fiscal year 1996.
    National instant criminal background check system.--The 
recommendation provides $50,000,000 for States to upgrade 
criminal history records so that these records can interface 
with other data bases holding information on other categories 
of individuals who are prohibited from purchasing firearms 
under Federal or State statute. In addition, $20,460,000 is 
included in the recommendation for the FBI to complete 
development of the national instant criminal background check 
system.
    State prison grants.--The recommendation provides 
$640,000,000 for the State Prison Grant Program, of which 
$170,000,000 is available to States for the incarceration of 
criminal aliens, and $12,500,000 is for the Cooperative 
Agreement Program. This program provides grants to States to 
build and expand temporary or permanent correctional 
facilities, boot camps, and jails to increase the capacity for 
confinement of violent criminals. The amount available for 
prison grants is $457,500,000, which is $52,500,000 more than 
both the 1996 funding availability and the request for this 
program. Because these funds are intended to increase prison 
capacity, the recommendation does not include language added by 
the House which would allow California to use these funds to 
support ongoing prison operations.
    Research and development to support counterterrorism 
technologies.--The Committee recommendation includes 
$10,000,000, as authorized in section 821 of the Antiterrorism 
and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, to be transferred to 
the National Institute of Justice to develop technologies that 
can be used to combat terrorism, develop standards, and assess 
requirements for technologies to assist State and local law 
enforcement in the national program to combat terrorism. The 
Committee urges NIJ, in cooperation with the Department of 
Defense, to focus on off-the-shelf technologies and current 
technologies utilized by Federal agencies that may be converted 
to law enforcement use.
    Local firefighter and emergency services training.--The 
Committee recommends $5,000,000, as authorized in section 819 
of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 
for grants to provide specialized training and equipment to 
enhance the capability of metropolitan fire and emergency 
service departments to respond to terrorist attacks.
    State Criminal Alien Assistance Program.--The 
recommendation provides $330,000,000 for the State Criminal 
Alien Assistance Program [SCAAP] for the reimbursement to 
States for the costs of incarceration of criminal aliens. This 
amount is in addition to $170,000,000 which is included for 
this purpose under the State Prison Grants Program. Thus, the 
Committee recommends a total of $500,000,000 for reimbursement 
to States for alien incarceration, which is the full amount 
requested, the same level as provided in fiscal year 1996 and 
the House allowance.
    The Committee is disappointed that the administration is 
not expected to allocate SCAAP resources provided in fiscal 
year 1996 this year. The current plan would award grant funds 
on November 22, 1996. The Committee urges OJP to accelerate its 
schedule for release of these much needed funds.
    Violence Against Women Act.--The Committee recommends 
$196,500,000, the full amount authorized, for grants to support 
the Violence Against Women Act. This amount represents an 
increase of $22,000,000 over the current year appropriation. 
Grants provided under this recommendation are for the following 
programs:

\1\ Included under U.S. attorneys.                                                                              

    In fiscal year 1996, the Committee provided $174,500,000 
for grant programs under the Violence Against Women Act to 
combat domestic violence. This amount represented an increase 
of $148,500,000 over the previous year--a 543-percent 
increase--recognizing the importance of combating domestic 
violence, despite budget constraints. This funding was to be 
distributed to States so that new programs could be started 
that would significantly enhance the availability of services, 
prosecutors, and law enforcement to women and children who are 
subjected to domestic violence.
    The 1996 increase was provided to expand units of law 
enforcement officers and prosecutors specifically targeted at 
crimes against women, develop and implement effective arrest 
and prosecution policies to prevent, identify and respond to 
violent crimes against women, strengthen programs addressing 
stalking and provide much needed victims services including 
specialized domestic violence court advocates to obtain 
protection orders. In addition, programs would be strengthened 
to encourage reporting of domestic violence by providing 
assurances that law enforcement and attorney support systems 
would be available.
    The Committee is deeply concerned that as of May 1996 only 
$473,000 of the $175,000,000 has been provided to State and 
local agencies and as a result the network of services, law 
enforcement personnel and support systems, are still not 
available to victims of domestic violence. Despite the emphasis 
by Congress, the Department has failed to effectively manage 
this important program. The Committee expects the Department to 
implement a plan to distribute the resources provided in this 
bill within 60 days of enactment, and report to the Committee 
on this plan by September 1, 1996.
    Substance abuse treatment for State prisoners.--The 
Committee recommends $29,700,000, a 10-percent increase over 
1996 funding levels, for grants to States and units of local 
government for development and implementation of residential 
substance abuse treatment programs within State correctional 
facilities, and certain local correctional and detention 
facilities. This amount is $2,700,000 more than was provided in 
fiscal year 1996, $6,300,000 below the request, and $5,300,000 
below the House allowance.
    Safe Return Program.--The Committee recommendation includes 
$900,000 to continue and expand the national program to locate 
missing Alzheimer patients.
    DNA identification State grants.--The recommendation 
includes $3,000,000 for grants to States and units of local 
government to support programs and projects to develop or 
improve the capability to analyze DNA in a forensic laboratory. 
The amount provided is the full amount requested and $2,000,000 
above the amount provided in fiscal year 1996. Within the 
amount made available under this program and in conjunction 
with State grants for this purpose under the FBI and the 
expanded use of technology grants available through the local 
law enforcement block grant, up to $32,500,000 is available to 
develop or improve forensic DNA testing capabilities in State 
and local forensic laboratories and to foster cooperation and 
mutual assistance among forensic DNA laboratories within 
States, such as between States that are seeking to match and 
exchange DNA identification records for law enforcement 
purposes using the FBI's combined DNA index system [CODIS]. The 
Committee expects OJP to examine the proposal to establish a 
South Carolina State DNA identification record data base and 
provide a grant, if warranted.
    Assistance for at-risk youth.--The recommendation does not 
include $8,000,000 for at-risk youth programs. Instead, a 
$10,000,000 increase above the request has been provided to 
juvenile justice and delinquency prevention programs.
    Motor vehicle theft prevention.--The recommendation 
provides $1,000,000 for grants to combat motor vehicle theft 
through cooperative partnerships between car owners and State 
and local law enforcement to reduce car theft committed by 
professional auto thieves and to facilitate their recovery. 
This amount is the same level provided in fiscal year 1996 for 
this program.
    Law enforcement family support programs.--The 
recommendation does not continue funding for this program.
    Senior citizens against marketing scams.--The 
recommendation does not provide $2,000,000, as requested, for a 
new program to assist law enforcement in preventing and 
stopping marketing scams against the elderly. The Committee 
believes that sufficient resources are provided to Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement to address this problem.
    Tuberculosis in prisons.--The recommendation does not 
include additional funds for treatment of tuberculosis is 
Federal and State prisons. In fiscal year 1996, $200,000 was 
provided for this program.
    Presidential summit on crime.--The recommendation does not 
provide $500,000, as requested, to conduct a Presidential 
summit on crime.
    The Committee understands that a critical need of State and 
local law enforcement is improved information systems for the 
identification and tracking of criminals. The recommendation 
will provide grants to States, Indian tribal, and local 
criminal justice agencies and nonprofit organizations to 
improve their efficiency through improved technology and 
automation. Grants can be made to: (1) increase the use of 
mobile digital terminals; (2) improve communications systems, 
such as computer-aided dispatch and incident reporting systems; 
(3) establish or improve ballistics identification programs; 
(4) increase the application of automated fingerprint 
identification systems and their communications on an 
interstate and intrastate basis; and (5) improve the 
computerized collection of criminal records.
    The Committee believes that grants should be used to the 
greatest extent possible to promote information sharing among 
Federal, State, and local criminal justice agencies and the 
development and implementation of compatible systems. The 
Committee expects that, when considering applications for 
grants made under this program, the Attorney General shall, to 
the extent possible, ensure State, Indian tribal, and local 
criminal justice agency proposals include technology that is 
compatible with or can interface with other national law 
enforcement and criminal justice information systems being 
developed, in particular, National Crime Information Center 
2000, the national instant background check system, national 
incident-based reporting system, and DRUGFIRE.

                         Weed and Seed Program

    The Committee recommendation provides $28,500,000 for the 
Weed and Seed Program from discretionary grants under the Byrne 
Program, the full amount requested and the same level as 
provided in 1996.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous fiscal years, making funds available 
for grants or agreements with State agencies or to reimburse 
Federal agencies in order to execute the weed and seed 
strategy, and also allows for the use of other Department of 
Justice funds to support the Weed and Seed Program.

                  Community Oriented Policing Services

Appropriations, 1996....................................  $1,400,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................   1,976,155,000
House allowance.........................................   1,400,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                           1,400,000,000

    The recommendation includes $1,400,000,000 for community 
oriented policing services--the COPS Program--for fiscal year 
1997.
    Maintaining a commitment to hiring 100,000 new police.--The 
fiscal year 1997 budget was submitted before agreement was 
reached on the fiscal year 1996 funding level for the COPS 
Program. The recommendation provides sufficient funding to meet 
the agreed upon target of 100,000 police by 2000. According to 
the most recent information available from the Justice 
Department, 47,627 new police will have been hired by the end 
of fiscal year 1997. At that time, an estimated $259,300,000 in 
end-of-year carryover balances will be available to hire more 
police. With a total of more than $1,650,000,000 available for 
fiscal year 1997, the COPS Program should be able to hire more 
than 20,000 new police in fiscal year 1997, bringing the total 
number of new hires to more than 67,000.
    The Committee continues to believe that the primary 
objective of COPS funding is to hire new police officers in the 
most cost-effective manner possible. In fiscal year 1996, 
$144,000,000, over 10 percent of the funds provided for this 
program, were used to support nonhiring initiatives. From this 
point forward, the COPS office should use grant funds to the 
maximum extent possible to hire more police, and should not use 
these funds for nonhiring projects. To help accomplish this 
goal, the Committee expects that in fiscal year 1997 hiring 
grants will continue to include grants under the Universal 
Hiring Program and the COPS MORE Program.
    Funding for nonhiring purposes, such as equipment, 
training, and overtime, is available to localities through the 
local law enforcement block grant and should not be duplicated 
under this program.
    The Committee continues bill language similar to the 1996 
appropriation limiting the amount spent on program 
administration. Unlike the House, the Committee believes an 
increase in staff is warranted to reduce delays in processing 
COPS grants. The Committee has included $19,800,000 limitation 
on management and administrative costs within this account to 
support 186 positions and 174 FTE's. Funding is for grant 
awards, payment processing, and post-awarded monitoring. The 
Committee would be willing to consider a reprogramming request 
for additional staff based on a demonstrated need. The 
Committee will only consider additional funding necessary to 
ensure prompt grant processing and payment and necessary 
monitoring and evaluation.
    Because the COPS Program remains ahead of schedule, bill 
language is included which would permit the administration to 
provide up to $20,000,000 for drug courts and up to $42,500,000 
for the administration's drug-testing initiative subject to the 
reprogramming procedures outlined in section 605 of this act.

                       Juvenile Justice Programs

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $148,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     149,500,000
House allowance.........................................     149,500,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             158,500,000

    The Committee recommendation provides a total of 
$158,500,000 for juvenile justice programs for fiscal year 
1997. This funding level is $10,000,000 more than the 1996 
appropriation. It is $9,000,000 more than either the request or 
the House allowance.
    Juvenile justice and delinquency prevention.--The Committee 
is aware of the growing problem of juvenile crime and that the 
rise in violence among youths is reaching crisis levels. The 
latest crime reports show alarming statistics--while overall 
crime fell 2 percent last year and violent crime fell by 4 
percent, the murder rate among teenagers between 1990 and 1994 
increased by 22 percent. Almost one-fourth of those arrested 
for weapons offenses in 1993 were under the age of 18. In 1994, 
juveniles accounted for one out of five violent crime arrests.
    The Committee recognizes that changes to juvenile justice 
and delinquency prevention [JJDP] programs are being considered 
in the reauthorization process of the Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Act of 1974. As such, the Committee recommendation 
includes language that provides that funding included for these 
programs shall be subject to the provisions of any 
authorization legislation that is enacted and that any 
provisions in this act that are inconsistent with that 
legislation shall no longer have effect.
    The Committee recommendation includes a total of 
$154,000,000 for fiscal year 1997 for administrative expenses 
and grants to States and localities for projects in the areas 
of education, research, prevention and rehabilitation as 
follows:
  --$5,000,000 for the Office of Juvenile Justice Programs 
        [OJJP] (part A).
  --$70,000,000 for formula grants for assistance to State and 
        local programs (part B).
  --$26,000,000 for discretionary grants for national programs 
        and special emphasis programs (part C).
  --$12,000,000, a $2,000,000 increase over fiscal year 1996 
        levels to expand the youth gangs (part D) program which 
        provides grants to public and private nonprofit 
        organizations to prevent and reduce the participation 
        of at-risk youth in the activities of gangs that commit 
        crimes.
  --$11,000,000, a $1,000,000 increase above the request for 
        discretionary grants for State challenge activities 
        (part E). This new program authorizes the OJJP 
        Administrator to award grants which could increase the 
        amount of a State's formula grant by up to 10 percent, 
        if that State agrees to undertake some or all of the 10 
        challenge activities included in this program. These 
        challenge activities are designed to improve various 
        aspects of a State's juvenile justice and delinquency 
        prevention programs.
  --$7,000,000, $3,000,000 more than requested, for the 
        Juvenile Mentoring Program (part G). This program seeks 
        to reduce juvenile delinquency, improve academic 
        performance, and reduce the drop-out rate among at-risk 
        youth through the use of mentors. The program brings 
        together young people in high crime areas with law 
        enforcement officers and other responsible adults who 
        are willing to serve as long-term mentors.
  --$23,000,000 for incentive grants for local delinquency 
        prevention programs (title V), a $3,000,000 increase 
        above the request. These grants are transmitted through 
        the State advisory groups to units of general local 
        government for delinquency prevention programs and 
        other activities for at-risk youth. Within the 
        increased amounts appropriated for discretionary grants 
        under title II and title V of the JJDP Act, the 
        Committee expects OJJP to examine each of the following 
        proposals, to provide grants if warranted, for each 
        proposal: a grant to the Institute on Violence and 
        Destructive Behavior; the Parents' Resource Institute 
        for Drug Education [PRIDE]; a grant to the coalition 
        for juvenile justice; restorative justice challenge 
        grants; the Teen Night Out Program; a Kansas Juvenile 
        Intake and Assessment Center; a grant to Parents 
        Anonymous, Inc. to enhance the capability of the 
        organization's national office to support delinquency 
        prevention and self-help programs in local chapters; 
        and continued support for law-related education.
    In addition, the Committee urges OJJP to pay particular 
attention to intervention and crime prevention programs which 
focus on addressing the unique circumstances and Indian 
reservations.
    Of the funds provided, the Committee directs that 
$1,500,000 be allocated to the establishment of the Jimmy Ryce 
Law Enforcement Training Center to meet the needs of State and 
local law enforcement officials investigating missing and 
exploited children cases.
    Victims of Child Abuse Act. The Committee recommends a 
total of $4,500,000 for the various programs authorized under 
the Victims of Child Abuse Act [VOCA]. In addition, funding of 
$6,750,000 is provided for victims of child abuse programs is 
included under the Violence Against Women Program funded under 
State and local assistance, violent crime reduction programs. 
The total amounts recommended for Victims of Child Abuse Act, 
equal the amounts provided in the current fiscal year and the 
full amount requested in the budget. The following programs are 
included in the recommendation:
  --$4,500,000 to improve investigations and prosecutions 
        (subtitle A) as follows:
  --$500,000 to establish regional children's advocacy centers, 
        as authorized by section 213 of VOCA;
  --$2,000,000 to establish local children's advocacy centers, 
        as authorized by section 214 of VOCA;
  --$1,500,000 for a continuation grant to the National Center 
        for Prosecution of Child Abuse for specialized 
        technical assistance and training programs to improve 
        the prosecution of child abuse cases, as authorized by 
        section 214a of VOCA; and
  --$500,000 for a continuation grant to the National Network 
        of Child Advocacy Centers for technical assistance and 
        training, as authorized by section 214a of VOCA.

                    Public Safety Officers Benefits

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $30,608,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      32,326,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              32,326,000

    The Committee recommendation includes the requested 
language for death and disability benefits under the Public 
Safety Officers Benefits Program for fiscal year 1997, which 
will fully fund anticipated payments. This program provides a 
lump sum death benefit payment to eligible survivors of 
Federal, State, and local public safety officers whose death 
was the direct and proximate result of a traumatic injury 
sustained in the line of duty. The recommendation also includes 
$2,200,000 the full amount requested, and the amount provided 
by the House, for lump sum payments to public safety officers 
who are permanently disabled in the line of duty.

               General Provisions--Department of Justice

    The Committee has included the following general provisions 
for the Department of Justice in this bill:
    Section 101 provides language, included in previous 
appropriations acts, which makes up to $45,000 of the funds 
appropriated to the Department of Justice available for 
reception and representation expenses.
    Section 102 provides language, included in previous 
appropriations acts, which continues for fiscal year 1997 
certain authorities for the Justice Department that were 
contained in the Department of Justice Authorization Act, 
fiscal year 1980.
    Section 103 provides language, included in appropriations 
acts prior to 1994, which prohibits the use of funds to perform 
abortions in the Federal Prison System.
    Section 104 provides language, included in previous 
appropriations acts, which prohibits the use of the funds 
provided in this bill to require any person to perform, or 
facilitate the performance of, an abortion.
    Section 105 provides language, included in previous 
appropriations acts, which states that nothing in the previous 
section removes the obligation of the Director of the Bureau of 
Prisons to provide escort services to female inmates who seek 
to obtain abortions outside a Federal facility.
    Section 106 provides language, similar to that included in 
previous appropriations acts, and recently amended in Public 
Law 104-19, which allows the Department of Justice to spend up 
to $10,000,000 for rewards for information regarding acts of 
terrorism against a U.S. person or property at levels not to 
exceed $2,000,000 per reward.
    Section 107 provides language, similar to that included in 
previous appropriations acts, which allows the Department of 
Justice, subject to the Committee's reprogramming procedures, 
to transfer up to 5 percent between any appropriation, but 
limits to 10 percent the amount that can be transferred into 
any one appropriation.
    Section 108 provides language included in prior 
appropriations acts that allows balances remaining in the 
assets forfeiture fund after September 30, 1996, to be 
available to the Attorney General for any authorized purpose of 
the Department of Justice.
    Section 109 adds new language, as proposed by the 
administration, to restructure quarterly fee payments for 
debtors under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and to allow 
all fees collected from chapter 7, 11, and 13 filings to be 
used as offsetting collections to the U.S. Trustees Program. 
Language is also included to clarify the intent of an amendment 
passed last year that fees are to be assessed in all pending 
chapter 11 cases.
    Section 110 adds language that establishes the 
telecommunications carrier compliance fund for payments to 
telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers to 
implement technology changes required under the Communications 
Assistance for Law Enforcement Act. Further description is 
provided under the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    While the Committee agrees that the administration should 
take steps to end illegal importation of Rohypnol, it has not 
included nonbinding language adopted by the House.
    Section 111. The Committee recommendation includes language 
requested by the Department of Justice to help moderate the 
effects of Victims of Crime Act [VOCA] fund deposits on VOCA-
funded programs. Additionally, language would allow the reserve 
fund to be used to assist the victims of the Oklahoma City 
bombing throughout the trial. Assistance could include payment 
of travel expenses to and from the trial site and crisis 
counseling.
    Sections 112, 113, and 114 provide bill language that has 
the same effect as language contained in the Senate-passed 
version of the Comprehensive Terrorism Prevention Act of 1995. 
On June 7, 1995, that bill passed the Senate on a 91-8 vote.
    Section 112 requires the Secretary of Treasury to study the 
tagging of explosive materials for purposes of detection and 
identification. Section 112: (1) reinstates the requirement to 
study taggants in black and smokeless powder; (2) eliminates 
the requirement to hold congressional hearings; and (3) reduces 
the time for making regulations effective for all taggants from 
270 days to 90 days.
    Section 113 would authorize courts to approve multipoint 
wiretaps, either where law enforcement officials can show that 
the suspect is changing telephones frequently for the purpose 
of avoiding interception, or where the very fact that the 
criminal was moving around and changing phones had the effect 
of thwarting surveillance, regardless of the criminal's intent. 
Law enforcement officials must still show probable cause that 
the suspect is committing a crime in order for the court to 
approve the wiretap. Section 113 does not in any way amend the 
requirement that a judge must certify that the wiretap meet all 
existing statutory and constitutional requirements.
    Section 114 adds to the list of crimes for which wiretaps 
can be authorized, such as: terrorist acts abroad; terrorist 
acts involving weapons of mass destruction; terrorist acts 
transcending national boundaries; providing material support to 
terrorists; violence at international airports; terrorist acts 
using biological weapons; and production of false 
identification documents such as visas and passports.
         TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND RELATED AGENCIES

    The Committee recommends a total of $3,640,807,000 for the 
U.S. Trade Representative, the International Trade Commission, 
and the Department of Commerce for fiscal year 1997. This 
amount is $685,367,000 below the total request, $48,224,000 
below the total amount appropriated for these programs for 
fiscal year 1996, and $104,554,000 above the House allowance.
    In April 1996, Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and 33 
Government and industry leaders were tragically lost when their 
Air Force aircraft crashed in Croatia. These dedicated 
individuals were taking part in a trade mission to Bosnia and 
Croatia trying to help that war torn region recover and develop 
economically. The loss of such talented and dedicated public 
servants was mourned throughout America, but nowhere more than 
at the Department of Commerce.
    Secretary Brown, Kathryn Hoffman, Duane Christian, Carol 
Hamilton, Bill Morton, Chuck Meissner, Gail Dobert, Lawrence 
Payne, Adam Darling, Steve Kaminski, Naomi Warbasse, and Kathy 
Kellogg represented the best and the brightest this country has 
to offer. They will be missed. The Committee wishes to 
acknowledge their contribution and their service to the Nation 
and expresses its condolences to their families and friends.
    On May 8, 1996, in his first appearance before the Senate 
as Secretary of Commerce, Michael Kantor announced an 
initiative to reduce Commerce personnel by an additional ``5 
percent below current levels within the next 7 months.'' While 
most of these reductions are a direct result of the 1996 
appropriation (Public Law 104-134), the Committee welcomes 
Secretary Kantor's contribution to streamlining departmental 
operations and has built his plan into its recommendations for 
fiscal year 1997 funding for the Commerce Department accounts 
contained in this title.
    While the House version of House Concurrent Resolution 178, 
Concurrent Resolution of the Budget--Fiscal Year 1997, assumed 
elimination of several functions within the Department of 
Commerce, neither the Senate version of the budget resolution 
nor the conference report on House Concurrent Resolution 178 
contained those assumptions. This issue is still under debate 
in the 104th Congress. The Committee recommends the elimination 
and downsizing of several functions within the Department. In 
fiscal year 1996, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration 
was abolished and residual sector specific functions for 
tourism were assumed by the International Trade Administration. 
As a result of this action, the tourism sector is given 
treatment consistent with other industries. In its funding 
recommendations for fiscal year 1997, the Committee has given 
priority to the core functions of the Department that will 
likely be continued in some form regardless of the outcome of 
the debate on the Department's future.

                  Trade and Infrastructure Development

    The Committee has included under this section of title II, 
the U.S. Office of the Trade Representative, the International 
Trade Commission, and the Department of Commerce agencies 
responsible for trade promotion and enforcement and economic 
infrastructure development.

                            RELATED AGENCIES

                Office of the U.S. Trade Representative

Committee recommendation

                                                              21,449,000

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $21,449,000 
for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] for 
fiscal year 1997. This amount is equal to both the budget 
request and the House allowance. It is $560,000 above a freeze 
at fiscal year 1996 levels.
    The Committee recommendation supports the reductions in 
personnel and administrative costs contained in the request 
which partially offset the requested one-time increase of 
$560,000 to replace the wiring in the Winder Building in 
Washington, DC, which cannot support planned computer and 
communications systems.
    The Committee is aware of concerns expressed about the 
Government of Mexico's daily limit on duty-free goods brought 
back across the United States-Mexican land border. The 
Committee is concerned about the lack of parity between United 
States and Mexican policies, and urges the United States Trade 
Representative to address this disparity in its bilevel 
discussions with Mexico and report back to the Committee on its 
efforts.

                     International Trade Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $40,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      41,707,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              41,707,000

    The International Trade Commission [ITC] is an independent, 
quasi-judicial agency responsible for conducting trade-related 
investigations, providing Congress and the President with 
independent technical advice relating to U.S. international 
trade policy, and performing other statutory responsibilities 
such as quasi-judicial determinations on trade matters filed 
with the Commission.
    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $41,707,000 
for the International Trade Commission for fiscal year 1997. 
This amount is the same as the budget request, and is a 
$1,707,000 increase over the current level and the House 
allowance.

Committee recommendation

                                                             267,939,000

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $267,939,000 
for the programs of the Commerce Department's International 
Trade Administration. The recommendation is $3,054,000 above 
enacted levels, $338,000 below the budget request, and 
$4,061,000 below the House allowance.
    On July 2, 1996, the Committee approved a reprogramming 
request to restructure ITA. This reorganization effort is 
intended to improve the Department's ability to enforce one of 
its most important missions: enforcement of trade laws and 
trade agreements. The proposal establishes a trade compliance 
center in order to enhance efforts to analyze and monitor 
foreign compliance with trade agreements. The new center is 
designed to serve as a focal point for U.S. companies 
interested in obtaining more information on the real impact of 
new and existing trade agreements, the rights they have as a 
result, and the market opportunities they present. The 
reorganization is to occur within existing resources within the 
division and with no increase in personnel.
    The Committee recommendation for ITA funding provides 
sufficient funding to maintain core trade policy, enforcement, 
and trade promotion activities. The Committee notes that in 
recognition of the importance of ITA's mission, it has not 
reduced appropriations to reflect Secretary Kantor's plan to 
cut Department personnel by 5 percent. The Committee recommends 
that resulting savings be used to augment the U.S. and Foreign 
Commercial Service and Trade Development divisions.
    Recommended funding levels are reflected below:

    The Committee believes that Mexico presents a potentially 
significant market for the United States. The lack of current, 
reliable environmental information for United States business 
on Mexican environmental laws has become an impediment to 
United States companies seeking business opportunities in 
Mexico. Accordingly, the recommendation includes $428,000 for a 
grant to the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce to 
analyze, collect, translate, format, and start distributing 
English versions of Mexico's current environmental regulations 
and standards.
    The recommendation includes $7,500,000 for the National 
Textile Center and $3,000,000 for the Textile/Clothing 
Technology Center, the same as provided in the House allowance 
and in fiscal year 1996. The Committee recognizes the 
importance of expanding the National Textile Center [NTC] 
University Consortium and has included an increase of $500,000 
for the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to join the 
NTC.
    United States and Foreign Commercial Service [US&FCS].--The 
recommendation assumes full funding for both the domestic and 
international offices of the US&FCS, including annualization of 
the increases provided in fiscal year 1996 to complete the 
reorganization of the domestic field structure, including four 
additional U.S. regional export assistance centers recently 
established. Commensurate with these funding increases, the 
recommendation increases the authorized FTE staffing level for 
US&FCS by 106 FTE's, to 1,331, the level authorized in fiscal 
year 1995.
    To increase the level of access to US&FCS export assistance 
centers [EAC], the Committee encourages the US&FCS to modify 
its current EAC network plan to include at least one additional 
district export assistance center in each region and report 
back to the Committee with its recommendations by no later than 
October 15, 1996.

Committee recommendation

                                                              34,698,000

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $34,698,000 
for the Bureau of Export Administration [BXA]. The Committee 
notes that BXA is unauthorized.
    BXA is the principal agency involved in the development, 
implementation, and enforcement of export controls for dual use 
technologies and weapons of mass destruction. The Export 
Enforcement Division [EE] detects, prevents, investigates and 
assists in the sanctioning of illegal dual-use exports.
    Counterterrorism initiative.--Events over the past 2 years 
have forced the United States to reevaluate its strategy for 
dealing with the terrorist threat. As part of its 
counterterrorism initiative, the Committee recommendation 
includes an additional $2,500,000 from the ``Counterterrorism 
fund'' account in the Department of Justice to increase onboard 
criminal investigator staff in export enforcement by 25 
positions and 22 FTE's. The Committee has provided this 
increase to enhance BXA's ability to combat terrorism by 
investigating alleged export control violations--particularly 
those involving nuclear and missile technology controls and 
chemical and biological controls. The Committee expects BXA to 
use these resources to pursue investigations, and to identify 
possible steps for better integrating export enforcement 
activities with domestic regulations related to controlled 
biological agents, without impeding legitimate international 
trade. The Committee supports BXA's implementation of plans to 
notify and visit potential exporters of controlled biological 
agents when these institutions and laboratories are identified 
by new HHS reporting requirements, and to encourage other 
countries, particularly Australia group countries, to adopt 
national policies for identifying potential importers and 
exporters of biolgocal agents.
    Fastener Quality Act implementaion.--The recommendation 
includes $1,200,000, 13 positions, and 10 FTE's in requested 
increases for Fastener Quality Act implementation.
    Reductions.--The Committee supports the $4,604,000 in 
spending reductions assumed in the budget request and notes 
that implementation of the Kantor plan will reduce fiscal year 
1997 funding requirements by an additional $2,000,000. The 
Committee supports continued improvement of the BXA online 
licensing system as a way to eliminate bureaucratic delay and 
duplication in the licensing process.
    The recommendation reflects the fact that, as of June 4, 
1996, the Department of Commerce projected $1,800,000 in end-
of-year carryover balances for this account. The Committee 
expects those resources will be used to supplement activities 
in the Bureau of Export Administration in fiscal year 1997, 
bringing total budgetary resources available to BXA to 
$36,498,000.
    The recommendation does not include the requested funding 
related to enforcement of the Chemical Weapons Convention 
Treaty because of continued delays in the treaty's 
ratification. Should the Senate vote to ratify this treaty, the 
Committee would be willing to consider a reprogramming of funds 
to support its implementation.

                                                             293,536,000

    The Economic Development Administration [EDA] provides 
grants to local governments and nonprofit agencies for public 
works, planning, and other projects aimed at facilitating 
economic development.
    The Committee recommends total funding of $293,536,000 for 
the programs and administrative expenses of the Economic 
Development Administration for fiscal year 1997. This is 
$60,000,000 below the request, and is $72,964,000 below the 
current year level, which included $18,000,000 in emergency 
appropriations. Funding amounts for the two appropriations 
accounts under this heading are displayed below.

                Economic Development Assistance Programs

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $328,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     333,500,000
House allowance.........................................     328,500,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             273,500,000

    The Committee recommendation provides total funding of 
$273,500,000 for economic development assistance programs 
[EDAP] in fiscal year 1997. This amount is a decrease of 
$55,000,000 below the current year level, and is $60,000,000 
below the budget request.
    The Committee recommendation includes level funding of 
$90,000,000 for defense economic conversion. In addition, the 
Committee recommendation provides $123,000,000 for public works 
grants (title I), $12,000,000 for planning assistance, and 
$8,500,000 for trade adjustment assistance. The Committee 
recommends that economic adjustment grants (title IX) be funded 
at a level of $40,000,000, with continued emphasis on 
addressing the needs of communities impacted by economic 
dislocations such as reduced timber harvests on Bureau of Land 
Management and Forest Service lands. Pursuant to section 11(b) 
of Public Law 99-663, within amounts provided, $5,000,000 is 
provided for the State of Oregon. The Committee is aware of 
several proposals for economic development assistance and 
strongly urges EDA to consider applications for the following 
proposals within applicable procedures and guidelines and 
provide a grant if warranted: (1) to demolish and remove two 
buildings for redevelopment in Nashua, NH; (2) to facilitate 
diversification of the Opal Creek Area in Oregon; (3) to 
redevelop vacant lots to revitalize historic industrial sites 
and recapitalize an economic development fund in Vermont; (4) 
to develop a multipurpose science and technology training 
center in Madisonville, KY; (5) for a proposal to use EDA funds 
in Butte, MT, to capitalize a revolving loan fund instead of 
proceeding with a warehouse renovation project; (6) to complete 
a defense conversion project adjacent to Homestead Air Force 
Base; (7) to develop a science center in Wichita, KS; (8) to 
develop infrastructure related to a cargo dock in Brownsville, 
TX; and (9) to establish a California maritime infrastructure 
bank.
    Language is included in the bill which allows the Secretary 
of Commerce to provide financial assistance to projects located 
on military bases closed or scheduled for closure even prior to 
the grantee having taken title for the property in question. 
Identical language has been carried in the bill for the past 3 
years.

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $20,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      20,036,000
House allowance.........................................      20,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              20,036,000

    The Committee recommendation provides the requested amount 
of $20,036,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Economic 
Development Administration [EDA], $36,000 more than the current 
year level. EDA has been successful in its efforts to downsize 
administration after significant funding cuts last year. The 
Committee directs EDA to continue to look for ways to 
streamline central headquarters and regional offices in order 
to allow for adequate field office staffing. Field 
representation plays an essential role in EDA's mission and 
should be maintained whenever possible.

                  Minority Business Development Agency

                     Minority Business Development

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $32,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      34,021,000
House allowance.........................................      29,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              26,000,000

    The Committee recommends $26,000,000 for the Minority 
Business Development Agency [MBDA] in fiscal year 1997. This 
amount is $8,021,000 below the budget request, $6,000,000 below 
the fiscal year 1996 enacted level, and $3,000,000 below the 
House allowance. The Committee expects, to the extent possible, 
that the reductions be taken from MBDA headquarters and 
regional staff rather than reducing service provider contracts.
    In 1995, MBDA reinvented its service-delivery strategy. 
Rather than target MBDA resources to entrepreneurs and 
startups, MBDA has decided to focus on established firms--
successful small to medium-sized companies--and target 
industries. While this change may have been intended to get 
more ``bang for the buck,'' its effect has been to move beyond 
the original mission of the MBDA--which was to increase 
minority business ownership. The mission change has resulted in 
MBDA picking winners and losers in the marketplace. The 
Committee rejects that approach.
    Additionally, the Committee disagrees with the action of 
the House which set aside $3,000,000 in the MBDA and $3,000,000 
in the Small Business Administration [SBA] for projects jointly 
developed, implemented, and administered. The Committee 
believes that the programs of the MBDA and the SBA are 
duplicative and that no additional funds should be dedicated 
for projects that only further duplicate those programs already 
administered by two separate agencies. Tight fiscal constraints 
prevent the Committee from continuing to support duplicative 
Government functions.
    Currently, there are a total of 976 small business 
development centers [SBDC's] operated by SBA in all 50 States. 
By contrast, MBDA operates about 100 minority business 
development centers [MBDC's] in only 36 States. By design, most 
MBDC's are either collocated with, or located a short distance 
from, an SBDC. SBA currently provides counseling to 
approximately 42,500 minority firms and training to 59,500 
minority clients. A 1994 Department of Commerce inspector 
general report found MBDA served only about 1 percent--or 
15,000 firms--of the potential minority business population. 
The lack of program effectiveness to serve the minority 
entrepreneurial community is very troubling to the Committee.
    In addition to these concerns, the Committee is also 
troubled by inspector general investigations of MBDA program 
and financial mismanagement, most recently associated with the 
L.A. MEGA Center project.
    The Committee notes that since its inception in 1969, 
neither the MBDA nor its predecessor, the Office of Minority 
Business Enterprise, has ever been authorized. Over the past 20 
years Democrats and Republicans have raised serious questions 
about the extensive overlap and duplication between MBDA and 
the SBA.

                 U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $2,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................................
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The Committee recommendation does not include funding for 
the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration [USTTA]. This amount 
is $2,000,000 below the amount provided for fiscal year 1996. 
The recommendation is identical to both the budget request and 
the House allowance.
    On February 6, 1996, the Committee approved a Commerce 
Department reprogramming request to transfer available 
resources to fund reductions in force and transfer core 
governmental functions of USTTA to the International Trade 
Administration. The Commerce Department proposal stated, 
``USTTA will no longer exist as a separate, independent entity 
within the Department of Commerce.'' That transfer has now been 
completed.

                Economic and Information Infrastructure

    The Committee has included under this section of the bill 
the Department of Commerce agencies responsible for the 
Nation's basic economic and technical information 
infrastructure, as well as the administrative functions which 
oversee the development of telecommunications and information 
policy.

                   Economic and Statistical Analysis

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $45,900,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      53,510,000
House allowance.........................................      45,900,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              49,400,000

    The Economic and Statistics Administration [ESA] is 
responsible for the collection, tabulation, and publication of 
a wide variety of economic, demographic and social statistics, 
and provides support to the Secretary of Commerce and other 
Government officials in interpreting the state of the economy 
and developing economic policy. The Bureau of Economic Analysis 
and the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs are funded in this 
account.
    The Committee recommendation provides funding of 
$49,400,000, which is $3,500,000 more than the level of funding 
for fiscal year 1996 for economic and statistical analysis 
programs, and is $4,110,000 less than the administration's 
request. An increase is provided for the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis to improve gross domestic product [GDP] data.

         Economics And Statistics Administration Revolving Fund

    The Economics and Statistics Administration operates a 
revolving fund for the payment of expenses incurred in the 
electronic dissemination of data, including the acquisition and 
public sale of domestic, federally funded and foreign business, 
trade and economic information. The revolving fund was 
initially established in fiscal year 1995 with a one-time 
appropriation of $1,677,000 to capitalize the fund.
    The Committee has included the necessary bill language for 
the continuation of a self-supporting revolving fund for data 
products of the Economics and Statistics Administration, as 
requested.

                          Bureau of the Census

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $284,112,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     399,355,000
House allowance.........................................     338,717,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             350,200,000

    The Committee recommendation provides $350,200,000 for the 
Bureau of the Census for fiscal year 1997. This amount is an 
increase of $66,088,000 above the amount provided for fiscal 
year 1996, and is $49,155,000 below the President's request. 
The Committee's recommendations for the Census Bureau accounts 
are described in more detail below.

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $133,812,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     150,665,000
House allowance.........................................     133,617,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             139,700,000

    This account provides for the salaries and expenses 
associated with the statistical programs of the Bureau of the 
Census, including measurement of the Nation's economy and the 
demographic characteristics of the population. These programs 
are intended to provide a broad base of economic, demographic, 
and social information used for decisionmaking by governments, 
private organizations, and individuals. Once again, the 
Committee emphasizes that the Bureau should make every effort 
to recover reimbursement for work requested by any other 
Federal agency or private organization.
    The Committee recommendation provides $139,700,000 for the 
salaries and expenses of the Bureau of the Census for fiscal 
year 1997. This amount is $5,888,000 more than the current year 
appropriation, and is $10,965,000 less than the budget request.
    The Committee notes that members of the Advisory Committee 
who drafted the USDA report ``Concentration in Agriculture'' 
emphatically endorsed and recommended a policy to support and 
improve market information as a vital component of a 
competitive marketplace. One of the specific recommendations 
included in the report is for more meaningful import and export 
reporting. The Committee urges the 484F Committee to work with 
industry to ensure that articles reported on the harmonized 
tariff schedule are the most relevant and helpful to the 
various stakeholders.

                     Periodic Censuses And Programs

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $150,300,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     248,690,000
House allowance.........................................     205,100,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             210,500,000

    This account provides for the constitutionally mandated 
decennial census, quinquennial censuses, and other programs 
which are cyclical in nature. Additionally, individual surveys 
are conducted for other Federal agencies on a reimbursable 
basis.
    The Committee recommends $210,500,000 for periodic censuses 
and related programs for fiscal year 1997. This amount is an 
increase of $60,200,000 above the amount provided for fiscal 
year 1996, and is $38,190,000 below the budget request.
    The recommendation includes $87,000,000 for the year 2000 
Decennial Census Program, an increase of $37,000,000 over the 
current-year level. Attempting to count every person in the 
United States and its territories through a decennial census is 
an enormous undertaking estimated to cost between 
$3,200,000,000 and $4,500,000,000 depending on how the count is 
conducted. The Committee is very concerned over the lack of 
progress on an authorization bill for the 2000 census, and 
encourages all parties involved to try to reach an agreement to 
ensure passage of a widely accepted approach to the 2000 
census. The increase provided here is for activities which will 
position the Bureau to be ready to move forward with a plan for 
the 2000 census once one is approved by Congress. Until then, 
the Committee directs that activities be limited to those which 
are critical to this effort, and that no funds be spent on 
preparation for a plan using statistical sampling.
    Geographic support activities will be critical to any 
decennial census effort, and the Committee recommendation 
provides $40,000,000 for this account. Similarly, the Committee 
has provided $19,000,000 for the Continuous Measurement 
Program. In addition, the Committee recommendation includes the 
following amounts: $26,300,000 for economic censuses; 
$2,400,000 for the census of governments; $5,000,000 for 
intercensal demographic estimates; $3,800,000 for continuing 
sample redesign to keep the Bureau's major surveys current; 
$9,000,000 for computer assisted survey information collection 
[CASIC]; and $18,000,000 for data processing systems. Funding 
for the census of agriculture will become the responsibility of 
the Department of Agriculture as requested by the 
administration.

       National Telecommunications and Information Administration

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $54,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      87,975,000
House allowance.........................................      51,740,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              35,328,000

    The Committee recommends a total of $35,328,000 in direct 
appropriations and another $5,900,000 in fees to Federal 
agencies for coordination of spectrum management, analysis, and 
operations for fiscal year 1997. The Committee notes that the 
NTIA is unauthorized.

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $17,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      18,478,000
House allowance.........................................      15,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              16,003,000

    The Committee recommends $16,003,000 in appropriations for 
the salaries and expenses appropriation of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA].
    Spectrum management.--The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 
1993 required the Secretary of Commerce to transfer a minimum 
of 200 megahertz [MHz] of spectrum utilized by the Federal 
Government to the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] for 
auction to the private sector. To date, 235 MHz of Federal 
spectrum has been identified for transfer.
    Federal, State, and local law enforcement currently operate 
at several different bands of spectrum. The Committee supports 
the recommendation of the ``National Performance Review'' that 
directed the Departments of Justice and Treasury to plan the 
implementation of a consolidated national law enforcement/
public safety wireless network that includes Federal, State, 
and local agencies. The FCC and NTIA are currently sponsoring 
the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee [PSWAC] which 
includes representatives from law enforcement, public safety, 
and industry to evaluate public safety spectrum needs and 
report their findings to Congress before the end of this fiscal 
year.
    The Committee has two major concerns with respect to this 
issue. First, future Federal spectrum use should be as cost 
effective as possible. Second, public safety, law enforcement, 
and national security needs must be given serious consideration 
before allocation of additional Federal spectrum for auction is 
finalized. Mistakes now could cost taxpayers hundreds of 
millions, perhaps billions of dollars in the future. At a 
minimum, the Committee urges PSWAC to expedite completion of 
its preliminary review as quickly as possible. In the interim, 
NTIA is prohibited from making additional Federal spectrum 
available for auction.
    Spectrum fees.--The Committee notes that the 1996 
appropriation (Public Law 104-134) permitted the Secretary of 
Commerce to charge Federal agencies for a portion of the cost 
of coordination of spectrum management, analysis, and 
operations. According to Commerce Department estimates, NTIA is 
expected to collect approximately $1,000,000 in fees this 
fiscal year and an estimated $5,900,000 in fiscal year 1997. As 
a result, a total of $21,903,000 in budgetary resources would 
be available to support NTIA operations in fiscal year 1997. 
That is a $3,903,000 increase over the budgetary resources 
provided in the 1996 appropriation. In addition, the Committee 
notes that the Department projects end-of-year carryover 
balances of $234,000 in other NTIA accounts. The Committee 
expects those resources would also be used to supplement NTIA 
activities in fiscal year 1997.
    The recommendation is sufficient to maintain current 
operations with the personnel reductions assumed in the budget 
request and those approved in the reprogramming process. The 
recommendation includes the budgetary resources sufficient to 
cover the $1,500,000 request for costs associated with the 1998 
International Telecommunications Union [ITU] Plenipotentiary 
Conference being hosted by the United States.
    The recommendation continues language from the 1996 
appropriation (Public Law 104-134) allowing the Secretary of 
Commerce to charge Federal agencies for a portion of the cost 
of coordination of spectrum management, analysis, and 
operations.

       Public Broadcasting Facilities, Planning, And Construction

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $15,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       8,000,000
House allowance.........................................      15,250,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              15,250,000

    The Committee recommends $15,250,000 for planning and 
construction grants for public television, radio, and 
nonbroadcast facilities.
    The Committee supports efforts to allocate a portion of 
these resources to distance learning and telemedicine 
initiatives, particularly those targeting rural areas.

                   Information Infrastructure Grants

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $21,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      59,000,000
House allowance.........................................      21,490,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               4,075,000

    The Committee recommends a major downsizing of the 
Information Infrastructure Grant Program under NTIA for 
demonstrations of new telecommunications technology 
applications.
    The Committee notes that this program has never been 
authorized.

            Endowment for Children's Educational Television

Appropriations, 1996....................................................
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      $2,497,000
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The Committee recommends elimination of the Endowment for 
Children's Educational Television Program. No funding was 
provided for this program in the 1996 appropriation (Public Law 
104-134); $2,497,000 was requested for fiscal year 1997. The 
House allowance provided no funding for this program.
    These grants are duplicative of programs funded under other 
agencies and through the private sector and have no 
relationship to other NTIA mission activities.

                      Patent and Trademark Office

                         Salaries And Expenses

Operations, 1996........................................    $614,424,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     716,700,000
House allowance.........................................     672,952,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             672,975,000

    The Patent and Trademark Office [PTO] is charged with 
administering the patent and trademark laws of the United 
States. PTO examines patent applications, grants patent 
protection for qualified inventions, and disseminates 
technological information disclosed in patents. PTO also 
examines trademark applications and provides Federal 
registration to owners of qualified trademarks. Currently, 
there is legislation pending in Congress to establish the 
Patent and Trademark Office as an independent Government 
entity. These proposals would make direct appropriations under 
this account unnecessary.
    The President's budget request for PTO salaries and 
expenses for fiscal year 1997 is $716,723,000, including 
$601,723,000 in fee collections and $115,000 in direct 
appropriations. This request is $102,299,000 over the fiscal 
year 1996 level, an increase of 17 percent.
    The Committee recommendation provides a total of 
$672,975,000 for PTO for fiscal year 1997, an increase of 
$58,551,000 that will provide all needed resources for the 
Patent and Trademark Office in conjunction with the 
Department's FTE ceiling. The Committee understands that a 
recently revised employment ceiling at PTO will negate the need 
for $36,000,000 of requested increases in this account. In 
addition, the Committee understands that at least $10,000,000 
of prior-year carryover balances will be available for use in 
1997 in addition to $601,723,000 in current fee collections. 
Therefore, the direct appropriation for this account is 
$61,252,000. If further cuts are needed to meet this budget 
target, the Committee directs that PTO should look first for 
reductions from its requested increase of $4,823,000 in 
Executive Direction and Administration.

                         Science and Technology

    The Committee has included under this section of title II 
the Department of Commerce agencies involved in technology 
research and development, scientific assessment and prediction 
of environmental phenomena, and the administrative and policy 
functions providing oversight for these activities.

                                                               7,500,000

    The Committee recommendation provides an appropriation of 
$7,500,000, which is $2,031,000 below the budget request and 
$2,500,000 above the House allowance.
    The recommendation provides $5,000,000 for the core mission 
of the Technology Administration and $2,500,000 for the United 
States-Israel Science and Technology Commission. Financial 
support for the Commission was requested in the budget, but 
eliminated in the House bill. The United States-Israel Science 
and Technology Commission supports increased collaborative 
activity between the high technology sectors in the United 
States and Israel. It is intended to create high wage jobs, 
expand export opportunities, and to enhance technology in both 
nations.

             National Institute of Standards and Technology

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $620,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     825,984,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             445,300,000

    The Committee recommends a total of $445,300,000 for the 
three appropriations accounts under the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology [NIST] for fiscal year 1997. A 
description of each account and the Committee recommendation 
follows:

             Scientific And Technical Research And Services

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $259,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     270,744,000
House allowance.........................................     268,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             270,400,000

    The Committee has provided $270,400,000 for the scientific 
and technical research and services (core programs) 
appropriation of the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology. This amount is an increase of $11,400,000 above 
fiscal year 1996 funding levels, $344,000 below the budget 
request, and an increase of $2,400,000 above the House 
allowance.
    The Committee recommendation is intended to maintain 
current research operations, provide an increase of $2,713,000 
for electronics and electrical engineering, and $2,000,000 is 
provided for a national resource construction program which 
would allow for the research, demonstration, and design of 
buildings to utilize natural resources.
    Quality program.--Within the amount designated for research 
support, the Committee has provided $2,980,000 for the base 
NIST Quality Program, which includes the Malcolm Baldrige 
National Quality Award. The Committee fully endorses the 
continuation of the basic Baldrige award program.

                     Industrial Technology Services

Appropriations, 1997....................................    $301,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     450,000,000
House allowance.........................................     200,400,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             159,900,000

    The Committee recommends $159,900,000 for the industrial 
technology services appropriation of the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology [NIST]. The Committee has recommended 
$99,900,000 for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program 
and $60,000,000 for the Advanced Technology Program.
    Advanced Technology Program.--The Committee recommendation 
includes $60,000,000 for the Advanced Technology Program, which 
is $283,975,000 below the budget request, $161,000,000 below 
fiscal year 1996, and $50,500,000 below the House allowance. In 
addition to these appropriations, the Committee notes that as 
of July 2, 1996, the Department of Commerce projected 
$40,000,000 in end-of-year carryover balances for the ATP 
Program. The Committee has included bill language stipulating 
that these funds provided in this act may only be used to 
finance continuation grants for prior year ATP awards. The 
recommendation does not include additional restrictions on the 
use of ATP funds adopted by the House.
    Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program.--The Committee 
recommends $99,900,000 for the NIST Manufacturing Extension 
Partnership [MEP] Program. This funding level is $19,900,000 
above fiscal year 1996, $5,100,000 below the President's budget 
request, and $10,000,000 above the House allowance.
    The recommended level supports a nationwide system of 75 
MEP centers. Consistent with the House allowance and the budget 
request, the Committee recommends $48,000,000, an increase of 
$18,000,000 above the current fiscal year, to continue 
manufacturing centers initiated under the Department of Defense 
Technology Reinvestment Program. The Committee also recommends 
$4,000,000 to continue the successful NIST centers in Kansas 
and Michigan. Bill language is included to clarify their 
continued operation for fiscal year 1997. These two centers 
assist over 31,000 small manufacturers in the States of Kansas, 
Michigan, Colorado, Missouri, and Wyoming. Finally, the 
Committee recommendation provides $6,000,000 for national 
programs to connect the nationwide network of centers, train 
center personnel, and coordinate programs and activities. The 
Committee concurs with the House allowance which eliminated 
funding for the SBDC pilot program.

                  Construction Of Research Facilities

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $60,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     105,240,000
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                                              15,000,000

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $15,000,000 
for construction of NIST facilities. While this amount is 
$45,000,000 lower than the 1996 appropriation, that bill also 
contained a rescission of $75,000,000 from unobligated balances 
within this account. The recommendation is $90,240,000 below 
the request. The Committee recommendation provides requested 
funding for maintenance and necessary fire and safety upgrades 
for existing NIST facilities, and for the completion of the new 
$57,400,000 Advanced Chemical Sciences Laboratory at the NIST 
Gaithersburg, MD, campus scheduled for completion in 1998. No 
funds are provided for new construction for this unauthorized 
program in fiscal year 1997. The Committee expects NIST to 
reassess its building requirements in light of reduced program 
and staffing levels and overall budget constraints.
    The recommendation does not include requested funds for 
construction of the Advanced Technology Laboratory.
    Because of concerns raised by the inspector general at the 
Department of Commerce about inappropriate obligation of 
construction funds in the closing days of fiscal year 1995, the 
recommendation includes a rescission in this account later in 
this title.

            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

                  Operations, Research, And Facilities

                     (including transfer of funds)

Appropriations, 1996....................................  $1,792,677,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................   1,971,215,000
House allowance.........................................   1,735,200,000

Committee recommendation

                                                           1,930,703,000

    The ``Operations, research, and facilities'' account of 
NOAA encompasses spending for the agencies which administer 
coastal and ocean research programs, fisheries programs, 
weather forecasting, and atmospheric research. During a time of 
continued budgetary constraint, the Committee recommendation 
continues to make funding for ocean, coastal, fisheries, and 
atmospheric programs a high priority by recommending funding 
for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration near 
the requested level. While progress on streamlining has been 
made, the Committee expects NOAA and the Department of Commerce 
to continue to explore ways to downsize programs and to move 
toward privatization of some of the functions funded under this 
account.
    The Committee recommends discretionary appropriations of 
$1,930,703,000 for operations, research, and facilities for 
fiscal year 1997, $40,512,000 less than the budget request, and 
$138,026,000 more than the level appropriated for the current 
fiscal year. The Committee recommendation includes a transfer 
of $62,000,000 from balances in the ``Promote and develop 
fishery products and research pertaining to American 
fisheries'' account, leaving approximately $4,000,000 remaining 
in the fund for Saltonstall-Kennedy grants. The total amount 
provided also includes a transfer of $5,276,000 from the damage 
assessment revolving fund.
    As in past years, the Committee expects NOAA and the 
Department of Commerce to adhere to the direction given in this 
section of the Committee report and to adhere to the 
reprogramming procedures outlined in the general provisions of 
the accompanying bill.
    The Committee recommendations by program are displayed in 
the following table:

    Some of the Committee recommendations displayed in the 
table above are described in more detail in the following 
paragraphs.

                         National Ocean Service

    The Committee recommendation provides a total of 
$197,231,000 for activities of the National Ocean Service [NOS] 
for fiscal year 1997.
    For mapping and charting, the Committee recommends 
$33,000,000. The Committee continues to support efforts to 
contract outside of NOAA to fulfill the charting and mapping 
functions.
    The Committee recommends $19,367,000 for NOAA's geodesy 
programs. Of this amount, $500,000 is included for continuation 
of geodetic survey work being conducted in South Carolina. The 
recommendation provides an increase of $200,000 for geodesy 
modeling efforts. The geodesy programs relate to measurements 
and analysis of data relating to precise latitudinal and 
longitudinal positioning with a variety of applications.
    The Committee recommendation includes $49,800,000 for 
coastal zone management [CZM] section 306 and 306(a) grants in 
order to maintain grant levels as new States enter the program. 
In addition, the Committee has provided $4,588,000 for the 
National Estuarine Research Reserve Program, a slight increase 
over the request in order to provide for additional reserves in 
line for designation, such as Grand Bay on the gulf coast. 
Amounts included for observation and prediction include 
continued support for Chesapeake Bay observation buoys and 
$2,000,000 to establish a national coastal data center in 
conjunction with the Northeast sea grant depository to ensure 
quick access to data from coastal areas around the Nation.
    For ocean assessment activities, the Committee recommends 
$28,619,000. Within the amounts provided, the Committee 
provides $2,000,000 for coastal hazards research and services 
and development of defense technologies for environmental 
monitoring at the NOAA Coastal Services Center. Thus, the total 
budget for the Coastal Services Center is maintained at its 
fiscal year 1995 level of $12,500,000. In addition, $2,700,000 
is provided for a research effort coordinating various 
components of the National Ocean Service with private sector, 
academic, and State researchers to utilize the Great Bay 
National Estuarine Research Reserve and the surrounding region 
to apply innovative technologies to the monitoring, management, 
and prevention of contamination of estuaries and coastal 
waters. The Committee recommendation provides an increase under 
this program for a south Florida initiative; it also provides 
increases above the fiscal year 1996 funding level for this 
initiative within both the Coastal Ocean Program and the 
National Marine Fisheries Service.
    The Committee has included the requested amount of 
$11,876,000 for the National Marine Sanctuary Program. The 
Committee expects that the total overhead charged to the 
National Marine Sanctuaries Program in fiscal year 1997 will 
not be in excess of the program's demands on those resources. 
The Committee directs that no user fees be imposed with respect 
to the Hawaiian Islands National Humpback Whale Sanctuary. In 
addition, the Committee has provided $15,200,000 for the 
Coastal Ocean Program. The Committee expects the program to 
maintain institute research on high-salinity estuaries at 
current funding levels.

                   National Marine Fisheries Service

    The Committee recommendation provides a total of 
$316,159,000 for the programs of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service [NMFS] for fiscal year 1997. The Committee has 
recommended funding, as shown in the preceding table, for a 
variety of important research and information programs which 
are designed to promote a sustainable use of valuable marine 
resources.
    The Committee recommends $3,000,000 for PACFIN, the Pacific 
fishery information network, including level funding for the 
Alaska fisheries information network [AKFIN]. The Committee has 
provided $3,900,000 for the RECFIN program, and expects that 
the programs for the west coast, Atlantic States, and Gulf 
States shall each receive one-third of the base funds, with 
continued funding for the red drum assessment and tagging 
effort in South Carolina and for aerial surveys for red drum 
recapture and age composition study in the Gulf of Mexico. The 
increase over current levels is for much needed annual 
collection and analysis of economic data on marine recreational 
fishing.
    The Committee has recommended a funding level of 
$98,513,000 for resource information within the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. Within this account, as in the current level 
of funding, not less than $250,000 is included for continued 
support of laboratory experimental bycatch research on 
commercially important west coast and North Pacific finfish by 
the Fisheries Behavioral Ecology Program of the Alaskan 
Fisheries Science Center at Newport; and not less than $850,000 
is included to continue the MARMAP program. Of the amounts 
provided, $1,500,000 is to initiate a consortium to develop 
technologies to enhance, supplement, and rehabilitate marine 
fishery resources on Mississippi's gulf coast; and $1,500,000 
is provided to establish a joint Federal-State partnership for 
critical studies regarding pollution and depletion of stocks in 
Narragansett Bay.
    The Committee recommendation includes $26,100,000 for 
fisheries management programs including $100,000 for the Alaska 
Native Harbor Seal Commission, and $150,000 is provided for 
operations of the Advisory Committee to the International 
Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna. The Committee 
has provided $1,900,000 for pelagic fisheries research and 
management, which includes continued funding at the current 
level on Pacific tuna and $400,000 for NMFS in Honolulu to 
conduct Pacific swordfish research.
    The Committee has restored funds for Hawaiian fisheries 
development and stock management programs. These programs are 
intended to deal with the unique aquaculture and fisheries 
enhancement needs of the Western Pacific. The Committee 
reiterates that these programs are to be operated by the 
Oceanic Institute, as was the Committee's intention during 
fiscal years 1994-96.
    The Committee recommendation provides an amount of 
$10,955,000 for Mitchell Act hatchery programs. This amount 
includes $655,000 for mass marking of Mitchell Act hatchery-
reared coho salmon. Funding for critical fish screens is 
provided under the ``Construction'' account. The Committee is 
aware of a number of scientific studies of the hatchery system 
in the Pacific Northwest, including ``UPSTREAM,'' ``Salmon and 
Society in the Pacific Northwest,'' published by the National 
Research Council in 1995. These reports raise serious questions 
about the direction and mission of the hatchery system. The 
Committee directs the Secretary of Commerce to submit a report 
to the Committee no later than January 31, 1997, detailing the 
Secretary's analysis of the conclusions and recommendations 
included in these studies, and indicating to the Committee what 
administrative changes have been made or will be made in 
response to these studies. This report shall include 
recommendations for changes in existing law or policy. The 
Committee encourages NOAA to continue to participate in the 
integrated hatchery operations team [IHOT]. This multiagency 
group is developing regionally integrated hatchery policy for 
operating all Columbia basin anadromous salmonid hatcheries. In 
addition, the Committee directs NMFS to cooperate fully with 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to accelerate feasibility 
studies and to speed design, construction, and testing of 
several promising systems for salmon recovery. The Committee 
notes that personnel retirements from the NMFS Northwest 
regional office are depleting that office's scientific 
capabilities, and urges the Department to meet these needs as 
quickly as possible, within available FTE levels.
    The Committee commends the Secretary's request for 
continued funding for NOAA's ongoing mission at the Marine 
Science Center in Newport, OR, and has provided not less than 
$400,000 to meet this request. The Committee expects these 
funds to be released in a timely fashion. In addition, the 
recommendation includes $5,700,000 for interstate fish 
commissions. This amount includes not less than $200,000 for 
each of the three interstate commissions.
    Within the funding the Committee has provided for the 
Marine Mammal Protection Act for fiscal year 1997, $250,000 
shall be made available to the State of Alaska to assist in the 
implementation of marine mammal take reduction plans, 
$1,500,000 is for marine resource observers in the North 
Pacific, $550,000 is for State of Alaska harbor seal research, 
and $350,000 is for the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission. In 
addition, the Committee recommends $1,770,000 for the Steller 
sea lion recovery plan. Of this amount, $825,000 is for work 
performed by the State of Alaska, and $330,000 is provided to 
the North Pacific Marine Science Foundation for research 
undertaken by the North Pacific Universities Marine Mammal 
Consortium.
    The Committee recommends $5,400,000 for Alaska groundfish 
monitoring, of which $1,100,000 is for crab management and 
research. Of this $1,100,000, $250,000 is directed for use by 
the State of Alaska to implement a Federal fishery management 
plan for crab. The remaining $850,000 shall be used for a crab 
research program to be jointly developed by the State of Alaska 
and NMFS. The Committee directs that $600,000 of the total 
provided be used for rockfish research, of which $250,000 shall 
be provided to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. In 
addition, $300,000 shall be made available to the Bering Sea 
Fishermen's Association for community development quota 
implementation work in western Alaska.
    The Committee recommends continuation of the current level 
of $3,278,000 for implementation of the High Seas Driftnet 
Fisheries Enforcement Act, and wishes to clarify that these 
funds may be used to implement the North Pacific Anadromous 
Stocks Convention Act and the Central Bering Sea Fisheries 
Enforcement Act, as well.

                    Oceanic and Atmospheric Research

    The Committee recommendation includes a total of 
$256,508,000 for oceanic and atmospheric research for fiscal 
year 1997. In implementing programs within this account, the 
Committee directs NOAA to maintain or enhance its level of 
collaboration with the extramural research community. In 
addition, while all NOAA external research is currently peer 
reviewed, the Committee encourages NOAA to take steps to ensure 
that all NOAA research, regardless of who performs it, is 
subject to periodic peer review.
    Within this account the Committee recommendation provides 
funding at the current level of $8,000,000 for interannual and 
seasonal climate research. In addition, the Committee provides 
funds for the Climate and Global Change Program at a level of 
$65,500,000. The Committee encourages NOAA to pursue 
opportunities presented by the interest of the Government of 
Japan, and other countries, in scientific collaboration with 
the United States in the area of climate research and 
prediction. The Committee provides $7,000,000 for the Global 
Learning to Benefit the Environment Program, and does not 
concur in the House report language.
    The Committee recommends funding for long-term climate and 
air quality research at a level of $38,402,000. Included within 
this amount is $9,000,000 for high-performance computing, an 
increase of $2,500,000 over the current year level.
    The Committee recommendation provides $14,651,000 for 
marine prediction research. This amount includes funding at the 
current year levels for VENTS, as requested in the budget, and 
for the Lake Champlain study. The Committee appreciates the 
timely and thorough preparation by NOAA of the tsunami hazard 
mitigation plan. The Committee agrees with the recommended 
implementation plan and directs NOAA to provide $2,375,000 to 
begin the process of implementation to reduce risk to the 
coastal residents and visitors in the vulnerable States of 
Oregon, Washington, California, Hawaii, and Alaska. The 
Committee directs NOAA to develop a tsunami mapping center in 
the State of Oregon to complement existing warning centers in 
Alaska and Hawaii and to expedite the implementation of the 
mitigation steps recommended in the plan. The Committee expects 
NOAA to provide funding to each of the Pacific States to 
accelerate the preparation of tsunami inundation maps.
    The Committee has provided funding of $14,900,000 for the 
National Undersea Research Program, and directs that each NURP 
center receive at least $1,610,000 of these funds in a timely 
manner. Because of the limited funding available for this 
purpose, it is critical that the structure and management of 
this program furthers the highest research needs. The Committee 
directs NOAA to create a long-range plan for national undersea 
research that carefully considers suggestions from the report 
released last year by a panel of seven eminent science 
administrators and researchers entitled ``Review of the 
National Undersea Research Program Structure.''
    The Committee recommendation includes $55,300,000 for the 
Sea Grant Program. For fiscal year 1997, the Committee 
recommendation includes continued funding for shellfish disease 
research, aquatic nuisance species research including research 
on zebra mussels, and the National Coastal Research and 
Development Institute at current year levels. The Committee 
directs NOAA to fund these initiatives within the ``Sea grant'' 
account, and believes these efforts can be accommodated within 
the normal process of priority setting and merit review.

                        National Weather Service

    The Committee recommendation includes a total of 
$646,514,000 for the National Weather Service [NWS] for 
operations, acquisitions, and research, as compared to 
$670,666,000 in the budget request, and $606,045,000 as 
provided for the current year.
    The total amount of funding recommended for operations and 
research is $467,320,000. This includes $465,320,000 for local 
warnings and forecasts, radiosonde replacement, aviation 
forecasts, central forecast guidance, and atmospheric and 
hydrological research. Within the total for operations and 
research, the Committee has provided funding at the current 
year level for regional climate centers, and $1,000,000 for the 
Susquehanna River Basin flood system.
    The Committee recommendation assumes that the National 
Weather Service will continue to look for areas where 
privatization of services might be cost effective. The NWS has 
made progress in its streamlining efforts. The Committee 
encourages NWS to continue to identify positions in central 
headquarters, as highlighted in the March 31, 1996, report to 
Congress by the inspector general, in order to lessen impacts 
on field offices during these tight budgetary times. The 
Committee directs that the modest reduction from the request 
included in this recommendation will have no impact upon any 
field office of the National Weather Service.
    The Committee recommendation provides the requested amount 
of $53,145,000 for next generation weather radars [Nexrad]. 
This amount includes funding for three additional Nexrad's in 
northern Indiana, northern Alabama, and western Arkansas. The 
Committee understands that the Weather Service shares its goal 
of seeing this equipment in place and operational before the 
1997 tornado season and urges that every effort be made to 
adhere to this schedule.
    The Committee has provided the request for $10,056,000 for 
the automated surface observing system [ASOS], a reduction of 
$6,896,000 from the current year as this system acquisition 
nears the end of its cycle.
    The recommendation includes an amount of $100,000,000 for 
the advanced weather interactive processing system [AWIPS]. 
This funding level is $19,800,000 less than the request, and is 
$50,000,000 more than the current year level in order to begin 
planned production and deployment of this system. The Committee 
is concerned, however, that NOAA may not be in a position to 
stay on its schedule for deployment of this system, and directs 
NOAA to report to the Committee by September 6, 1996, as to the 
status and budgetary needs of necessary software and other 
systems planned for deployment in fiscal year 1997.

  National Environmental and Satellite, Data, and Information Service

    The Committee recommendation provides funds for the 
National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service 
[NESDIS] at a level of $465,981,000 for fiscal year 1997.
    For the Polar Satellite Program, the Committee has provided 
a total of $176,644,000, of which $29,000,000 is for the 
interagency program office to converge the NOAA and Department 
of Defense [DOD] polar satellite programs. The funding level 
for polar convergence fully meets the revised estimate of need 
for this fiscal year, which was agreed upon jointly by NOAA and 
DOD. The Committee recommendation assumes that NOAA and DOD 
share equally in the costs of all common activities for this 
program.
    The Committee recognizes the valuable role that ocean 
remote sensing can play in the management of marine fisheries 
oceanography and coastal management and has provided $6,000,000 
to continue this high-priority program. In addition, $1,000,000 
is provided within amounts for environmental data management 
systems for efforts in conjunction with the National Ocean 
Service, as described above, to create a national coastal data 
center.

                            Program Support

    The Committee recommendation provides the requested level 
of $131,083,000 for the NOAA program support functions. This 
level is $1,376,000 less than current year funding.
    Within the ``Program support'' account, the Committee 
recommendation provides the requested level of $56,292,000 for 
marine services, $4,808,000 below the current level of funding. 
This account funds the operation of a fleet of vessels with 
capabilities to conduct research and measurements in line with 
NOAA's mission. Funding is provided at the full request this 
year for marine services and should avoid any disruption in 
NOAA's oceanographic, fisheries, and mapping and charting 
activities. The Committee has received NOAA's fleet assessment 
report in response to the Committee's direction last year, and 
it has received the inspector general's review of the fleet as 
well. The Committee believes that, for fiscal year 1997, the 
agency should use a combination of NOAA owned and operated 
vessels as well as contracting for ship time. The Committee 
further believes that the UNOLS (university) fleet presents a 
cost-effective means to provide for marine services, and NOAA 
should utilize the UNOLS fleet to the maximum extent possible. 
Greater reliance on the UNOLS fleet already has been occurring, 
as NOAA's fleet has reduced from 25 to 14 vessels in active 
service. In fiscal year 1996, NOAA has deactivated two 
oceanographic research vessels and has allocated more resources 
to UNOLS. Thus, for fiscal year 1997, the NOAA fleet only will 
have one active oceanographic research vessel, the Ronald H. 
Brown (AGOR 26) which is nearing completion and will be 
deployed in 1997. In 1993, Congress appropriated $54,000,000 to 
construct this vessel and intended the ship to be owned and 
operated as a Government asset by NOAA. The Committee does not 
concur with the House report language regarding this vessel, 
and believes that NOAA should proceed with the deployment and 
operation of the Ronald H. Brown as planned by the agency.
    The Committee recommendation includes the requested amount 
of $10,182,000 for operation of NOAA aircraft services 
including support for the new hurricane surveillance jet not 
provided in the House allowance. The Committee expects NOAA to 
reassess the necessity to support aircraft not meeting minimum 
usage standards and consider alternatives to NOAA ownership and 
operation of its aircraft.

                      Coastal Zone Management Fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $7,800,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       7,800,000
House allowance.........................................       7,800,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               7,800,000

    This fund consists of loan repayments arising from the 
former Coastal Energy Impact Program which are transferred to 
the ``Operations, research, and facilities'' account for 
program grants.
    The Committee recommendation includes $7,800,000, as 
requested, from the coastal zone management [CZM] fund for CZM 
program management and other purposes authorized by section 308 
of the CZMA. The Committee intends that $4,500,000 shall be 
available from the fund, as requested, for program 
administration. For use of remaining amounts, the Committee 
encourages coordination within NOS in order to supplement new 
initiatives under the ocean assessment program meeting the 
purposes of section 308 of the CZMA.

                              Construction

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $50,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      37,366,000
House allowance.........................................      36,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              58,000,000

    This account provides for construction, repair, and 
modification of new facilities and additions to existing 
facilities, planning, design, and land acquisition. The 
Committee recommends a total funding level of $58,000,000 for 
NOAA's ``Construction'' account.
    The Committee recommendation provides $1,800,000 for NOAA 
research facilities, $1,750,000 for the Sandy Hook lease, 
$10,000,000 for Nexrad WFO construction, and $3,750,000 for 
NOAA facilities maintenance. In addition, the Committee 
recommends funding of $4,700,000 for Columbia River facilities, 
$5,000,000 for environmental compliance, $1,000,000 for 
national centers for environmental prediction, $5,000,000 for 
continuation of facilities improvements at the National Marine 
Fisheries Service southeast laboratory, $2,000,000 for costs 
related to relocating the Tiburon Fisheries Laboratory, and 
$3,000,000 for facilities associated with the National 
Estuarine Research Reserve System.
    The Committee has provided $5,000,000 requested by the 
administration for the cleanup of property formerly owned by 
NOAA on the Pribilof Islands. This funding is provided to 
remediate contaminated soil, to close and remediate landfills, 
diesel seep sites, debris sites, solid and liquid wastes, to 
remove public safety hazards, to fund the planning and the 
construction of landfills, and to fund other cleanup and 
removal activities that may be necessary on St. George and St. 
Paul Islands, AK.
    The Committee recommendation for construction includes 
$2,500,000 for the renovation of the National Marine Fisheries 
Service Honolulu laboratory's facilities. The facilities are 
severely overcrowded, do not comply with Americans With 
Disabilities Act standards, and post fire and environmental 
hazards. The recommendation also includes $3,500,000 for 
remodeling and minor additions to existing buildings at the 
Newport Marine Science Center, and the Committee directs NOAA 
to immediately release funds appropriated last year for studies 
regarding critical space requirements at the Center.
    The Committee directs NOAA to continue architectural and 
engineering work on the new NOAA facility in Juneau, AK, using 
previously appropriated funds for such purpose. In addition, 
$9,000,000 is provided to complete this work and to begin site 
preparation and development of this project. To the extent that 
construction funds are not otherwise obligated, NOAA may 
propose use of these funds for advanced lease payments in 
conjunction with the Kodiak Near Island office and laboratory 
facility.

           Fleet Modernization, Shipbuilding, And Conversion

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $8,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      12,000,000
House allowance.........................................       6,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               8,000,000

    The Committee recommendation provides an appropriation of 
$8,000,000 for the ``Fleet modernization, shipbuilding, and 
conversion'' account. This is a decrease of $4,000,000 below 
the budget request, is the same as the current year funding 
level, and is $2,000,000 above the House allowance.
    The Committee has provided funds above the House-passed 
level in this account for the outfitting and completion of the 
Ronald H. Brown, as discussed above under the ``Program 
support'' account. As discussed under the account heading 
``Marine Services'', the Committee is encouraged that NOAA has 
now prepared an assessment of the fleet and is considering 
options other than the revised fleet modernization plan 
previously submitted to Congress. The Committee believes the 
UNOLS fleet provides an excellent resource to meet many of the 
agency's requirements.

            Fishing Vessel And Gear Damage Compensation Fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $1,032,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         200,000
House allowance.........................................         200,000

Committee recommendation

                                                                 200,000

    The fishing vessel and gear damage fund provides 
compensation to U.S. fishermen whose vessels have been lost, 
damaged, or destroyed by foreign or domestic vessels. Revenue 
sources for this fund include: (1) surcharges not to exceed 20 
percent of the fee imposed for any foreign fishing vessel 
permit issued under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act; (2) administrative fees paid by claimants; (3) 
revenues from deposits or investments of fund balances not 
immediately required; and (4) funds not to exceed $5,000,000 
borrowed from the Treasury in the event the fund balance is 
insufficient to pay claims.
    The Committee recommendation provides $200,000 for the 
fishing vessel and gear damage compensation fund. This amount 
is the same as the request and a decrease of $832,000 below the 
amount available for the current fiscal year because of a 
decrease of amounts available in this fund.

                      Fishermen's Contingency Fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $999,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       1,002,000
House allowance.........................................       1,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               1,000,000

    The Committee recommends the requested amount of $1,000,000 
for the fishermen's contingency fund, which is $1,000 above the 
amount appropriated for fiscal year 1996.
    The fishermen's contingency fund provides compensation to 
U.S. fishermen for damage or loss of fishing gear and any 
resulting loss because of natural or man-made obstructions 
related to oil and gas exploration, development, and production 
on the Outer Continental Shelf. The Secretary of Commerce is 
authorized to establish an area account within the fund for any 
area within the Outer Continental Shelf. A holder of a lease, 
permit, easement, or right-of-way in such area is required to 
pay a fee into the appropriate area account in the fund. Each 
area account, if depleted, will be replenished by assessment. 
The authorization stipulates that amounts available in each 
area account can be disbursed only to the extent provided by 
appropriations acts. Since receipts collected may not be 
sufficient for this appropriation, the Committee has included 
language which provides that the sums necessary to eliminate 
the insufficiency may be derived from the general fund of the 
Treasury.

                     Foreign Fishing Observer Fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $196,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         196,000
House allowance.........................................         196,000

Committee recommendation

                                                                 196,000

    The Committee recommends $196,000 for the foreign fishing 
observer fund for fiscal year 1997. This amount is the same as 
the budget request and the current year level.
    Fees paid into the fund are collected from owners and 
operators of certain foreign fishing vessels that fish within 
the U.S. fishery conservation zone. The fund supports salaries 
of U.S. observers and program support personnel, other 
administrative costs, and the cost of data management and 
analysis.

                 Fishing Vessel Obligations Guarantees

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $250,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         250,000
House allowance.........................................         250,000

Committee recommendation

                                                                 250,000

    The Committee recommendation provides $250,000 for fishing 
vessel obligations guarantees. This amount of funding is the 
same as the 1996 level, and is the same as the budget request.
    The Committee recommends that this loan guarantee program 
be used only for purposes which do not result in 
overcapitalization, including: the refinancing of existing 
debt; renovation and repair of existing vessels and facilities; 
construction of new shore plants for underutilized species, 
aquaculture, and waste reduction; and the replacement of 
obsolete vessels of similar size and harvesting capacity. The 
Committee directs that no loan guarantee be made for any new 
vessel that will increase the harvesting capacity in any U.S. 
fishery.

                         General Administration

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $29,100,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      29,100,000
House allowance.........................................      27,400,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              29,100,000

    This account provides for the Office of the Secretary and 
for staff offices of the Department which assist in the 
formulation of policy, management, and administration.
    The Committee recommendation provides $29,100,000 for the 
Commerce Department's salaries and expenses appropriation for 
fiscal year 1997. This amount is the same as the budget request 
and the amount appropriated for the current fiscal year, which 
was a reduction of $7,371,000 from the fiscal year 1996 level.

                      Office of Inspector General

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $19,849,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      20,849,000
House allowance.........................................      19,445,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              20,849,000

    This appropriations account provides for salaries and 
expenses of the Office of Inspector General in support of its 
efforts to enhance efficiency and detect fraud, waste, and 
abuse in Commerce Department programs and operations.
    The Committee recommends $20,849,000 for the Commerce 
Department's Office of Inspector General for fiscal year 1997. 
This amount is an increase of $1,000,000 above the current 
appropriations level, and is the same as the budget request. 
The recommendation provides for a program increase in order for 
the inspector general to perform needed audits under the 
requirements of the CFO Act of 1990.

             National Institute of Standards and Technology

                  Construction Of Research Facilities

                              (Rescission)

    The Committee recommends a rescission of $31,800,000 from 
obligated and unobligated balances in the Construction of 
Research Facilities Program under the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology [NIST].
    During the last week of fiscal year 1995, NIST obligated 
$51,600,000 for construction projects--$31,800,000 more than 
the Department had estimated to Congress as late as August 
1995. The inspector general of the Department of Commerce has 
raised serious questions concerning this action. The inspector 
general's report released in July 1996 states, ``The obligation 
of $31,800,000 without proper authority, and during a period of 
congressional scrutiny, raises concerns about the adequacy of 
the Capital Improvements Facilities Program [CIFP] management 
process.''

            National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

                  operations, research, and facilities

                              (Rescission)

    The Committee recommendation includes a rescission of 
$10,000,000 from the NOAA ``Operations, research, and 
facilities'' account under this title. The Committee directs 
that this rescission be taken from funds provided in fiscal 
year 1996 for the Landsat and polar satellite programs within 
the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information 
Service. The Committee understands that funding originally 
provided for these purposes is no longer required due to 
reestimation of program requirements in the polar convergence 
program and a decision by NASA to pay the full development 
costs of the Landsat program.

               General Provisions--Department of Commerce

    The Committee has included the following general provisions 
for the Department of Commerce that were included in the fiscal 
year 1996 appropriations act (Public Law 104-134). Sections 201 
through 207 are continuations of language included in previous 
appropriations acts. Section 208 is included at the 
administration's request.
    Section 201 makes Commerce Department funds in the bill 
available for advanced payments only upon certification of 
officials designated by the Secretary that such payments are 
considered to be in the public interest.
    Section 202 makes appropriations for the Department in the 
bill for salaries and expenses available for the hire of 
passenger motor vehicles, and for services, uniforms, and 
allowances as authorized by law.
    Section 203 prohibits any of the funds in the bill to be 
used to support hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and 
activities that are under the control of the U.S. Air Force or 
the U.S. Air Force Reserve.
    Section 204 prohibits the use of Commerce Department funds 
in this or any previous act from being used for the purpose of 
reimbursing the unemployment trust fund or any other account of 
the Treasury to pay unemployment compensation for temporary 
census workers for services performed after April 20, 1990.
    Section 205 provides the authority to transfer funds 
between Department of Commerce appropriation accounts. The 
language provides that no account may be decreased by more than 
5 percent or increased by more than 10 percent. The language 
also makes the transfers subject to the Committee's standard 
reprogramming procedures.
    Section 206 provides for notification of the House and 
Senate committees of a plan for transferring funds to 
appropriate successor organizations within 90 days of enactment 
of any legislation dismantling or reorganizing the Department 
of Commerce, should such legislation be enacted.
    Section 207 requires that any costs related to personnel 
actions incurred by a department or agency funded in title II 
of the accompanying act, be absorbed within the total budgetary 
resources available to such department or agency.
    Section 208 prohibits funds, including funds from laws 
hereinafter enacted, from being used to develop or implement 
any new individual fishing quota programs until offsetting fees 
are authorized to pay for such implementation.
    The Committee has not included language included in section 
209 of the House bill regarding contracts for mapping and 
charting activities.
    Section 210 establishes a working capital fund in the 
Bureau of the Census to be available without fiscal year 
limitation. This mechanism is intended to improve financial 
reporting and auditing performance, and will help identify 
costs of specific services provided both within the Bureau and 
to the public.
    Section 211 prohibits funds from being used to develop or 
implement any user fee related to the Hawaiian Islands National 
Humpback Whale Sanctuary.
                        TITLE III--THE JUDICIARY

    The funds provided in title III of the accompanying bill 
are for the operation and maintenance of the U.S. courts and 
include the salaries of judges, magistrates, supporting 
personnel, and other expenses of the Federal judiciary.
    The Committee recommendation provides a total of 
$3,282,284,000 for the judiciary. This amount includes the full 
requested funding of $261,205,000 for salaries and retirement 
funds of the Justices and judges which are considered mandatory 
for budget purposes. The recommendation also provides an 
additional $3,021,079,000 in discretionary funding for other 
judiciary programs under this title, including $30,000,000 from 
the violent crime reduction trust fund. The total amount 
provided by the Committee is an increase of $227,472,000 over 
funding for fiscal year 1996.
    The budget request submitted by the judiciary for fiscal 
year 1997 totals $3,473,719,000. The discretionary portion of 
the request, $3,212,514,000 represents an increase of 
$419,701,000 or 15 percent, over the enacted amounts for fiscal 
year 1996. Of this amount, $35,000,000 is requested from the 
violent crime reduction trust fund. The Committee 
recommendation is $191,435,000 below the request, but assumes 
that a significant amount of 1996 funds will carry over in some 
accounts in order to provide additional funding.
    In order to continue its efforts against violent crime this 
year, the Committee is providing a significant increase in 
funding the critical activities carried out by the Federal 
judiciary. Because of the enhanced criminal investigation and 
prosecution activities funded elsewhere in this bill, the 
Committee intends that increased funding for the judiciary 
provided here be used in an efficient manner to fund increased 
workload demands.

    The Committee recommends a total of $30,257,000 for the 
Supreme Court of the United States for fiscal year 1997. The 
total amount is provided in two separate appropriation accounts 
as follows:

                         Salaries And Expenses

    The Committee recommends $27,157,000 for fiscal year 1997 
for the salaries and expenses of the Justices, their supporting 
personnel, and the costs of operating the Supreme Court, 
excluding the care of the building and grounds. The Committee 
recommendation is $1,323,000 more than the current year 
appropriation, and is equal to the budget request for this 
account.

                    Care Of The Building And Grounds

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $3,313,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               3,100,000

    The Committee recommends $3,100,000 for fiscal year 1997 
for personnel and other services relating to the Supreme Court 
building and grounds, which is supervised by the Architect of 
the Capitol. The recommendation is $213,000 less than the 
current year appropriation, is $213,000 less than the request, 
and is $610,000 more than the House allowance.
    The Committee recommendation assumes the requested 
reductions to the base of $375,000. The Committee expects the 
Architect of the Capitol to endeavor to find efficiencies in 
service so that projects, especially those relating to 
security, might be considered within the amount provided.

    The Committee recommends $15,013,000 for fiscal year 1997 
for the salaries and expenses of the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit. The recommended level of funding is 
$725,000 more than the current year appropriation, is $965,000 
less than the request, and is the same as the House allowance.
    The Committee recommendation provides the requested 
adjustments to base for this account.

Committee recommendation

                                                              11,114,000

    The Committee recommends the full requested amount of 
$11,114,000 for fiscal year 1997 for the salaries and expenses 
of the U.S. Court of International Trade. The Committee 
recommendation is an increase of $255,000 over the 1996 level 
in order to provide requested adjustments to base.

    Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................  $2,463,141,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................   2,782,346,000
House allowance.........................................   2,568,956,000

Committee recommendation

                                                           2,608,646,000

    This account provides for the salaries of judges, 
magistrates, and all other officers and employees of the 
Federal judiciary not otherwise provided for, and for all 
necessary expenses, including charges for space and facilities.
    The Committee recommends a total of $2,608,646,000 for this 
account for fiscal year 1997, including $30,000,000 from the 
violent crime reduction trust fund as authorized in Public Law 
103-322 and Public Law 104-132. The Committee recommendation is 
a reduction of $173,700,000 from the budget request, but is 
$145,505,000 above the amount appropriated for fiscal year 
1996, and is $39,690,000 above the House allowance. In 
addition, the Committee understands that the judiciary will 
realize carryover funds of at least $97,000,000 resulting from 
unanticipated fee revenue in fiscal year 1996, and will have 
other fees and reimbursable funds which were not included in 
the President's fiscal year 1997 budget. In addition, the 
Committee understands that $12,000,000 of funding appropriated 
under the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 is no longer needed, 
and expects the judiciary to utilize available balances from 
this appropriation in fiscal year 1997 for authorized purposes 
under the ``Salaries and expenses'' account.
    The Committee recommendation provides requested adjustments 
to base, but does not provide the costs of the judges' pay 
increase which has not been authorized by Congress at this 
time. In addition, an amount of $10,000,000 over the fiscal 
year 1997 base has been provided to meet the demands of the 
Prison Litigation Reform Act passed in the Commerce, Justice, 
State and the Judiciary portion of the Omnibus Consolidated 
Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-
134). The Committee wishes to clarify the intention of Congress 
that the judiciary bear the cost only of special masters 
appointed subsequent to the enactment of Public Law 104-134. 
The Committee supports efforts of the judiciary to make 
electronic information available to the public, and expects 
that available balances from public access fees in the 
judiciary automation fund will be used to enhance availability 
of public access.
    In light of the funding offsets described above, the 
recommendation will provide significant program increases under 
this account. The Committee recognizes the need for all 
branches of Government to share the burden of budgetary 
constraint, but has provided increases in this account because 
of the increasing workload faced by the Federal courts. Within 
the overall funding level provided, the judiciary is encouraged 
to fund judicial priorities, such as additional magistrate 
judges, additional bankruptcy deputy clerks, and probation and 
pretrial monitoring of those who might pose a risk to local 
communities. The recommendation provides $500,000 for the 
commission to study the structure and alignment of the Federal 
Courts of Appeals, created in section 307.
    Violent crime reduction trust fund.--The Committee has 
provided $30,000,000 for the judiciary from the violent crime 
reduction trust fund for fiscal year 1997 instead of 
$35,000,000 as requested and $30,000,000 as provided in fiscal 
year 1996. The Committee intends that amounts provided be used 
for carrying out provisions of the Violent Crime Control and 
Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Antiterrorism and Effective 
Death Penalty Act of 1996.

               The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $2,318,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       2,390,000
House allowance.........................................       2,390,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               2,390,000

    The Committee recommends a reimbursement of $2,390,000 for 
fiscal year 1997 from the special fund to cover expenses of the 
claims court associated with processing cases under the 
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986. This amount is 
the same as requested and is an increase of $72,000 above the 
amount appropriated for the current fiscal year.

                           Defender Services

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $267,217,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     318,905,000
House allowance.........................................     297,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             311,900,000

    This account funds the operations of the Federal public 
defender and community defender organizations and the 
compensation, reimbursement, and expenses of attorneys 
appointed to represent persons under the Criminal Justice Act, 
as amended.
    The Committee recommends $311,900,000 for fiscal year 1997 
for this account. This is an increase of $44,683,000 from the 
fiscal year 1996 level and a reduction of $7,005,000 from the 
request. The fiscal year 1996 amount does not reflect 
$28,544,000 in carryover balances that were used to supplement 
funding in that year. No carryover balances are projected for 
fiscal year 1997. This recommendation fully funds the estimated 
needs in order to facilitate quick and orderly criminal trials.
    The recommended funding reflects a reduction from the 
requested increases which corresponds to the annualized cost of 
personnel hired to provide representation in Federal death 
penalty habeas corpus cases. Congress eliminated funding of 
death penalty resource centers (post conviction defender 
organizations) in fiscal year 1996. If the Federal judiciary 
desires to fund representation of convicted felons in these 
appeals, it should do so from the base funding provided for 
this account.

                    Fees Of Jurors And Commissioners

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $59,028,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      68,083,000
House allowance.........................................      66,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              68,083,000

    The Committee recommends the requested amount of 
$68,083,000 for fiscal year 1997 for the fees and allowances of 
grand and petit jurors and for the compensation of land 
commissioners and jury commissioners. This represents an 
increase of $9,055,000 from the fiscal year 1996 level of 
funding, is the same as the request, and is $2,083,000 more 
than the House allowance.

                             Court Security

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $102,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     131,885,000
House allowance.........................................     131,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             127,000,000

    This account provides for the necessary expenses of 
security and protective services for the U.S. courts in 
courtrooms and adjacent areas. Funds under this account may be 
used directly or transferred to the U.S. Marshals Service which 
has been delegated authority for the contracting of guard 
services and the acquisition of security equipment.
    Countering terrorism.--The Committee recommendation of 
$127,000,000 for court security for fiscal year 1997 is an 
increase of $25,000,000 over the amount provided for fiscal 
year 1996. In addition, $4,000,000 will be made available for 
this account from the counterterrorism fund in the Department 
of Justice, so that the full $131,000,000 request is provided. 
The recommended amount funds requested adjustments to base 
including the annualization costs of court security officers 
hired with funding provided in fiscal years 1995-96 to enhance 
security in the courts and provides funds for new officers and 
equipment for new or renovated facilities. In 1995, Congress 
passed $16,600,000 in supplemental appropriations (Public Law 
104-19) for court security following the bombing in Oklahoma 
City.

                Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $47,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      53,523,000
House allowance.........................................      48,500,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              50,900,000

    This appropriation provides funds for the administration 
and management of the U.S. courts, including the probation and 
bankruptcy systems, but excluding the Supreme Court.
    The Committee recommends $50,900,000 for the salaries and 
expenses of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts for 
fiscal year 1997, an increase of $3,400,000 from the current 
fiscal year appropriated level, a reduction of $2,623,000 from 
the fiscal year 1997 budget request, and an increase of 
$2,400,000 over the House allowance. Because the Administrative 
Office recently maintained a hiring freeze, the recommended 
level will be adequate to fund requested needs in order to 
provide proper management support to the judiciary.

                        Federal Judicial Center

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $17,914,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      19,625,000
House allowance.........................................      17,495,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              17,914,000

    The Committee recommends $17,914,000 for the salaries and 
expenses of the Federal Judicial Center for fiscal year 1997, a 
freeze at the fiscal year 1996 appropriation and a reduction of 
$1,711,000 from the budget request.
    The Center has made progress in streamlining the research 
and technology functions of the center, some of which overlap 
with functions performed by the Administrative Office of the 
Courts. The recommendation assumes that further reductions will 
be made in this area in order to maintain education and 
training efforts.

                       Judicial Retirement Funds

                    Payment To Judiciary Trust Funds

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $32,900,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      30,200,000
House allowance.........................................      30,200,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              30,200,000

    The Committee recommends $30,200,000 for the payment to the 
judicial officers' retirement fund, the judicial survivors' 
annuities fund, and the claims court judges' retirement fund 
for fiscal year 1997. This amount is equal to the budget 
request, and is $2,700,000 less than the current year 
appropriation for this account. These funds are considered 
mandatory for budgetary purposes.
    These funds will cover the estimated annuity payments to be 
made to retired bankruptcy judges and magistrate judges, claims 
court judges and spouses and dependent children of deceased 
judicial officers.

                       U.S. Sentencing Commission

                         Salaries and Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $8,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       9,200,000
House allowance.........................................       8,300,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               8,867,000

    The Committee recommends $8,867,000 for the salaries and 
expenses of the U.S. Sentencing Commission for fiscal year 
1997. This represents an increase of $367,000 to fund 
adjustments to base, and a reduction of $333,000 below the 
budget request.
    The purpose of the Commission is to establish, review, and 
revise sentencing guidelines, policies, and practices for the 
Federal criminal justice system. The Commission is also 
required to monitor the operation of the guidelines and to 
identify and report necessary changes to the Congress.

                   General Provisions--The Judiciary

    The Committee has included the following general provisions 
in the bill for the Judiciary.
    Section 301 provides language, included in previous 
appropriations acts, to permit funds in the bill for salaries 
and expenses for the judiciary to be available for employment 
of experts and consultant services as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 
3109.
    Section 302 provides language included in previous 
appropriations acts which authorizes appropriations for the 
special court of appeals established under the Regional Rail 
Reorganization Act of 1973, Public Law 93-236.
    Section 303 provides language, included in previous 
appropriations acts, which permits up to 5 percent of any 
appropriation made available for fiscal year 1997 to be 
transferred between judiciary appropriation accounts with the 
proviso that no appropriation shall be decreased by more than 5 
percent or increased by more than 10 percent by any such 
transfer. In addition, the language provides that any such 
transfer shall be treated as a reprogramming of funds under 
section 605 in the general provisions of the accompanying bill 
and shall not be available for obligation or expenditure except 
in compliance with the procedures set forth in that section.
    Section 304 provides language permitting not to exceed a 
total of $10,000 for expenses of official reception and 
representation expenses incurred by the Judicial Conference of 
the United States.
    Section 305 contains language extending for 1 year the 
authorization for the judiciary automation fund in order to 
continue the orderly and effective administration of the 
judiciary's automation programs to make information and 
services more accessible to the public through enhancing the 
availability of electronic information.
    Section 306 clarifies the intention of Congress that the 
judiciary bear the cost only of special masters appointed 
subsequent to the enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act 
provisions passed as part of Public Law 104-134.
    Section 307 establishes a commission to study the structure 
and alignment of the Federal courts of appeals.
           TITLE IV--DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND RELATED AGENCIES

    The subcommittee's 602(b) budget authority allocation is 
$3,733,500,000 below the President's request, $724,000,000 
above a CBO freeze at fiscal year 1996 levels, and $705,000,000 
below the House allocation. Under these severe budgetary 
constraints, the Committee has had to make difficult choices 
and set priorities. The Committee has undertaken a 
comprehensive review of current spending here in the United 
States and internationally. In total, the amounts recommended 
in this title for the Department of State, the U.S. Information 
Agency [USIA] and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency 
[ACDA] are below the authorized levels set forth in the 
conference report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, fiscal years 1996-97, as passed by the 
Senate on March 28, 1996, by a vote of 52 to 44. Funding for 
virtually every program contained in this title is at or below 
the fiscal year 1997 authorization level provided in that bill.
    On January 27, 1995, the Vice President issued a press 
release announcing the second phase of the ``National 
Performance Review'' for foreign affairs agencies. The press 
release stated: ``It is anticipated that the overall review of 
international affairs programs and agencies will result in 
savings of at least $5,000,000,000 over 5 years and a 
substantially enhanced capacity to deliver more effective 
programs overseas and provide value to the American taxpayer.'' 
Since that release was issued, the administration has 
consistently denied requests by the chairman, the ranking 
member, and other members of the subcommittee for the details 
of its $5,000,000,000 savings plan.
    The combination of tight budgetary constraints and lack of 
cooperation from the administration gave the Committee no 
choice in fiscal year 1996 but to initiate its own savings plan 
aimed at reducing overlap and duplication in the current 
foreign affairs bureaucracy. The result of that effort was the 
Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, 1996 which was adopted in the Senate on 
April 25, 1996, by a vote of 88 to 11 as part of H.R. 3019, the 
fiscal year 1996 Omnibus Appropriations Act (Public Law 104-
134). That bill cut the budgetary resources available to the 
Department of State, USIA, and ACDA $546,900,000 below the 
President's fiscal year 1996 budget request and $555,396,000 
below a freeze at fiscal year 1995 spending levels.

                          DEPARTMENT OF STATE

    The Committee recommends a total of $3,512,765,000 for 
fiscal year 1997 for the Department of State. This amount is 
$1,501,200,000 less than the budget request for fiscal year 
1997, $459,723,000 less than the fiscal year 1996 
appropriations for the Department, and $363,243,000 below the 
House allowance.
    The Committee recommendation includes a total of 
$2,639,429,000 for the appropriation accounts under 
administration of foreign affairs; $832,600,000 for the 
appropriation accounts under international organizations and 
conferences; $40,736,000 for international commissions; and 
elimination of the Asia Foundation. The Committee's recommended 
priorities for the Department of State are described in more 
detail below.

                   Administration of Foreign Affairs

                    diplomatic and consular programs

Appropriations, 1996....................................  $1,719,220,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................   1,747,909,000
House allowance.........................................   1,692,150,000

Committee recommendation

                                                           1,701,600,000

    This appropriation account provides for the formulation and 
execution of U.S. foreign policy, including the conduct of 
diplomatic and consular relations with foreign countries, 
diplomatic relations with international organizations, and 
related activities. This account primarily funds the overseas 
programs and operations of the Department of State.
    The Committee recommends $1,700,900,000 for the 
``Diplomatic and consular programs'' account and an additional 
$8,400,000 from the counterterrorism fund at the Department of 
Justice for security enhancements at overseas posts. The 
recommendation will require a reduction of $63,582,000 below 
the amount required to maintain the fiscal year 1996 operations 
level in fiscal year 1997, and will require personnel 
reductions, and other streamlining and savings initiatives in 
addition to those assumed in the request. Total budgetary 
resources provided for fiscal year 1997 are identical to the 
fiscal year 1997 authorization for this account contained in 
the conference report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1996-97.
    Enhanced border security.--The recommendation includes bill 
language requested by the administration to fund an estimated 
$25,000,000 in border security staff and support costs from 
machine-readable visa [MRV] receipts. This would build on 
efforts initiated in fiscal year 1996. Fee receipts would 
support efforts to prevent passport and visa fraud domestically 
and overseas. In addition, receipts could be used to develop, 
maintain, and operate computer systems applications related to 
the Border Security Program. The Committee notes that the 
Department projects $7,500,000 in end-of-year carryover 
balances in these fee accounts which should help mitigate the 
impact of the overall funding reductions contained in the 
Committee recommendation.
    Diplomatic Telecommunications Service Program Office.--In 
1991, the Congress terminated the Department of State 
Telecommunications Network Program. This action followed a 
review by the Senate Intelligence Committee's blue ribbon panel 
which examined requirements and redundancies between U.S. 
agencies overseas. Program termination saved an estimated 
$350,000,000. The Congress further directed that the Department 
of State and other agencies' telecommunications systems serving 
U.S. diplomatic and consular posts overseas be consolidated 
into the Diplomatic Telecommunications Service [DTS]. A program 
of joint upgrades was placed under the direction of the DTS 
Program Office [DTS-PO]. These joint upgrades save the U.S. 
Government money, both in the long and short term. In 1994, the 
Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate directed DTS-
PO to proceed with a pilot project at five overseas posts. The 
Committee has repeated bill language that earmarks funds for 
DTS-PO operations and modernization.
    The Committee remains concerned with the progress of the 
pilot initiative and further recognizes that there appears to 
exist continued resistance to the consolidation effort. Such 
redundancy cannot be afforded financially, and it is not in the 
best interest of the Government. It is the Committee's 
intention that all agencies continue to fully support DTS-PO 
and that the pilot projects be completed expeditiously and that 
the evaluation be submitted.
    Enhanced security.--In separate bill language, the 
Committee has provided $8,400,000 for enhanced security 
overseas which was not contained in the President's request. 
The Committee directs that this funding be used to supplement 
the $9,720,000 one-time security enhancement requested as part 
of the President's fiscal year 1996 antiterrorism budget 
amendment. The recommendation includes: $4,300,000 for security 
equipment; $2,700,000 for the local guard program; and 
$1,400,000 for armored vehicles in terrorist threat posts.
    Spending reductions.--The budget request for this account 
included $32,179,000 in program decreases, which, together with 
$17,785,000 in program decreases included in the ``Salaries and 
expenses'' account, would require budget savings measures, 
including a reduction of 265 positions. Overseas operating 
costs will be an estimated $5,036,000 as a result of 13 post 
closings approved in fiscal year 1996. Each of these proposed 
reductions are assumed in the Committee recommendation.
    Spending increases.--The recommendation includes $9,091,000 
for replacement of overseas equipment and requested increases 
for the costs associated with hosting the 1997 Summit of 
Industrialized Nations and 1998 International 
Telecommunications Union Plenipotentiary Conference. The amount 
of $450,000 is provided to support U.S. participation by the 
State of Alaska in the sustainable development activities of 
the Arctic Council Sustainable Development Secretariat. An 
amount of $35,000 is provided for the Commission on Protecting 
and Reducing Government Secrecy for the purposes of producing 
the Commission's final report.
    Improving shared administrative support services.--
Currently the State Department subsidizes the overseas 
operations of more than 100 U.S. Government organizations. Over 
the past 10 years, the number of Americans working for the 
Federal Government overseas has increased by roughly 19 
percent. During that time, overseas staffing levels at the 
State Department have remained relatively constant. By 
contrast, overseas staffing at other agencies has increased 
dramatically. Overseas Justice Department staffing is up more 
than 90 percent. The number of American Department of 
Transportation staff overseas has increased by more than 30 
percent. Overseas Treasury Department staffing is up more than 
20 percent. The 1996 appropriation directed that: (1) the 
President's fiscal year 1997 budget reflect the full cost of 
each Department and agency's operations; and (2) 1996 would be 
the last year that the State Department subsidize the 
operations of other Federal agencies through the outmoded 
foreign affairs administrative support [FAAS] system.
    FAAS was designed to ensure reimbursement by other agencies 
for the Department's incremental expenses incurred in providing 
administrative support to non-State agencies overseas. The 
Committee strongly supported efforts within the administration 
to implement the new international cooperative administrative 
support services [ICASS] system for fiscal year 1997. 
Unfortunately, the administration chose to delay full 
implementation of ICASS until fiscal year 1998. That means that 
for fiscal year 1997, the State Department will be required to 
finance approximately $116,000,000 more of other U.S. 
Government agencies' overseas operating costs than would be 
required under the agreed upon ICASS system.
    The administration's failure to comply with this truth-in-
budgeting initiative has prompted the Committee to include 
language requiring that the new ICASS system be fully 
implemented by fiscal year 1998. The President's budget request 
for fiscal year 1998 for each Federal agency must include the 
full costs of its overseas operations in accordance with ICASS. 
In addition, the Committee has chosen to reduce the request for 
diplomatic and consular programs by $38,000,000--roughly one-
third of current State Department estimates of the amount that 
implementation of the new ICASS system would save State each 
year. This action is intended to give the Secretary of State a 
financial incentive to expedite implementation of the new ICASS 
system. In the interim, the Committee would encourage the 
Secretary of State to consult with the heads of agencies with 
overseas operations and seek reimbursement for a portion of 
these costs.
    Economic cooperation overseas.--The Committee is pleased 
that the Department of State and U.S. and Foreign Commercial 
Service have made efforts to reduce duplication. The State 
Department, for example, has made progress in eliminating low-
priority economic reporting.
    The Committee urges the State Department to continue 
streamlining its economic operations, and to focus its economic 
activities on three principle objectives: (1) negotiating 
bilateral and multilateral agreements; (2) influencing foreign 
governments to support specific U.S. economic and commercial 
interests; and (3) enforcing economic sanctions in support of 
U.S. foreign policy goals.
    The conference agreement accompanying the fiscal year 1996 
Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill noted that 
while foreign service officers from other non-State Department 
agencies have been elevated to Ambassadorial rank, no senior 
officer from the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service has been 
selected as an Ambassador. The conferees noted that they 
expected the administration to appoint at least one US&FCS 
officer to Ambassadorial rank.
    To date, the Committee is not aware of any US&FCS officer 
who has been promoted to Ambassadorial rank. The Committee is 
disappointed in the Department's lack of responsiveness to the 
guidance accompanying the current appropriation. The Committee 
strongly suggests that the Department address this issue and 
move expeditiously to recognize the diplomatic expertise that 
resides among the dedicated corps of US&FCS officers.
    Post closings.--The Committee approved 13 posts recommended 
by the Secretary of State for closure in fiscal year 1996. The 
Committee supports the efforts of the Department to develop 
objective criteria for the evaluation and prioritization of 
overseas posts. In the future, the Department must give the 
potential impact on economic, diplomatic, and law enforcement 
interests, particularly on neighboring border communities in 
the United States, appropriate consideration in the evaluation 
process.
    The Committee has included language in the bill, requested 
by the administration, which will provide not to exceed 
$700,000 in registration fees collected pursuant to section 45 
of the State Department Basic Authorities Act for activities of 
the Office of Defense Trade Controls. In addition, the 
Committee language provides not to exceed $15,000 from 
reimbursements, surcharges, and fees for use of Blair House 
facilities in accordance with the State Department Basic 
Authorities Act.
    The bill includes a provision which permits up to 20 
percent of the amounts made available in the ``Diplomatic and 
consular programs'' account and ``Salaries and expenses'' 
account to be transferred between such appropriations accounts 
in order to provide administrative flexibility to the 
Department.

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $365,146,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     358,159,000
House allowance.........................................     352,300,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             357,000,000

    The Committee recommends $357,000,000 for the ``Salaries 
and expenses'' account of the Department of State. The 
recommendation is identical to the fiscal year 1997 
authorization for this account contained in the conference 
report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1996-97.
    This appropriation provides for the management, 
administrative, and support functions of the Department of 
State, including the Office of the Secretary. The fiscal year 
1996 appropriation included a one-time $1,870,000 increase for 
enhanced security.
    The recommendation assumes all the spending reductions 
contained in the budget request, carry forward of the 
administrative reductions contained in Public Law 104-134 and 
an increase of $6,424,000 for the final installment required to 
complete the Columbia Plaza renovation project begun in fiscal 
year 1989.

                        Capital Investment Fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $16,400,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      32,800,000
House allowance.........................................      16,400,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              32,800,000

    The Committee recommends $32,800,000 for the ``Capital 
investment fund'' account, compared to a request of 
$32,800,000, and a fiscal year 1996 funding level of 
$16,400,000. The recommendation is $16,400,000 more than the 
fiscal year 1997 authorization for this account contained in 
the conference report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1996-97.
    This new account was created in fiscal year 1996 to provide 
resources for needed investments in information systems. The 
Committee notes that in past years, managers at the Department 
minimized investments in infrastructure in an attempt to 
maintain staffing levels. Budgetary constraints dictate that 
capital investments be made now to ensure that the Department 
will be able to perform its mission in the coming years with 
fewer people.
    The Department's information systems are inadequate to meet 
critical mission requirements; about 80 percent of the 
Department's automated data processing equipment is classified 
as obsolete; 75 percent of the Department's telephone systems 
are outdated; and one-half of the Department's posts have 
inadequate numbers of personal computers.
    The recommendation includes no less than $2,965,000 for 
information systems security upgrades and no less than 
$2,430,000 for security technology programs as outlined in the 
State Department's recent evaluation of diplomatic security 
needs.
    While funding constraints prevent the Committee from 
providing more resources to this account at this time, the 
Committee has included language requested by the administration 
which would allow expedited passport fee receipts to supplement 
efforts to accelerate information technology improvements. The 
Committee would encourage the Department to find additional 
resources within other accounts which might be reprogrammed to 
this account subject to the requirements of section 605 of this 
act.

                      Office Of Inspector General

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $27,369,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      27,369,000
House allowance.........................................      27,495,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              27,495,000

    For the combined Office of the Inspector General for the 
Department of State and the U.S. Information Agency, the 
Committee recommends $27,495,000. The recommendation is 
identical to the fiscal year 1997 authorization for this 
account contained in the conference report to accompany H.R. 
1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 
1996-97.
    In fiscal year 1996, the Committee merged the Office of 
Inspector General of the U.S. Information Agency with the 
Office of Inspector General of the State Department as a first 
step toward the proposed consolidation of the foreign affairs 
agencies. As a result of this action, the State inspector 
general now has jurisdiction over the Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency and the United States Information Agency 
[USIA]. Bill language has been included to make this move 
permanent.

                       Representation Allowances

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $4,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       4,656,000
House allowance.........................................       4,490,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               4,490,000

    The Committee recommends $4,490,000 for representation 
allowances authorized by section 905 of the Foreign Service Act 
of 1980. It is $10,000 lower than the fiscal year 1997 
authorization for this account contained in the conference 
report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1996-97.
    These funds provide partial reimbursement to Foreign 
Service officers for expenditures incurred in their official 
capacities abroad in establishing and maintaining relations 
with officials of foreign governments and appropriate members 
of local communities.

              Protection Of Foreign Missions And Officials

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $8,579,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       8,332,000
House allowance.........................................       8,332,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               8,332,000

    The accompanying bill includes a total of $8,332,000 for 
the appropriation entitled, ``Protection of Foreign Missions 
and Officials.'' This amount is the same as the budget request 
and the House allowance. It is $247,000 less than the 
appropriation provided for fiscal year 1996.
    This account reimburses local governments and communities 
for the extraordinary costs incurred in providing protection 
for international organizations, foreign missions and 
officials, and foreign dignitaries under certain circumstances. 
The Committee directs that local jurisdictions which incur such 
costs submit a certified billing for such costs in accordance 
with program regulations. The Committee also recommends that in 
those circumstances where a local jurisdiction will realize a 
financial benefit from a visit from a foreign dignitary through 
increased tax revenues, that such circumstances should be taken 
into account by the Department in assessing the need for 
reimbursement under this program. The Committee expects the 
Department to treat such submissions diligently and provide 
reimbursement to local jurisdictions on a timely basis if 
claims are fully justified.
    Of the total amount recommended, $1,574,000 is available 
for protection of foreign diplomats and their families 
throughout the United States. The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 
authorizes the provision of such services when necessary either 
at the request of a foreign mission or on the initiative of the 
Secretary of State. In these situations, where State and local 
authorities cannot provide the security required, the act 
permits the Department of State to employ the services of 
private security firms.
    Of the total amount recommended, $6,758,000 is allocated to 
reimburse New York City for the protection of foreign missions 
and officials credited to the United Nations and other 
international organizations. These funds provide for the costs 
of guard posts and security escort and motorcade services to 
foreign missions and personnel assigned to the United Nations.

           Security And Maintenance Of United States Missions

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $385,760,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     386,060,000
House allowance.........................................     370,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             360,000,000

    The Committee recommends a total appropriation of 
$360,000,000 for security and maintenance of United States 
missions for fiscal year 1997. The total amount provided in 
this appropriation account for fiscal year 1997 is $25,760,000 
below fiscal year 1996 funding levels. In addition to funding 
reductions in fiscal year 1996, the budgetary resources for 
this account were reduced with the enactment of two rescissions 
totaling $94,500,000 (Public Law 104-19 and Public Law 104-
134). The recommendation is $26,060,000 below the request, 
$10,000,000 below the House allowance, and $20,000,000 below 
the fiscal year 1997 authorization for this account contained 
in the conference report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1996-97.
    The 1996 appropriation changed the name of this account 
from ``Acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad'' to 
``Security and maintenance of United States missions.'' The new 
name is intended to more accurately reflect the activities 
funded by this account. This account provides the funding that 
allows the Department to manage U.S. Government real property 
in over 200 countries worth an estimated $12,000,000,000 and to 
maintain almost 14,000 residential, office, and functional 
properties, not only for the Department of State, but for all 
U.S. employees overseas.
    Like the 1996 appropriation, the recommendation provides no 
funding for new capital projects, reflecting a shift in 
emphasis from capital construction to enhanced management of 
existing facilities. The Committee recommends funding for all 
current leases; security, safety, and efficiency upgrades; 
maintenance of existing facilities; and supervision and 
management for ongoing projects. The recommendation provides 
$25,000,000 less than the request for rehabilitation projects 
to give State an added incentive to dispose of surplus real 
estate assets.
    Last year, the Committee recommended rescissions of 
projected carryover balances in this account to draw down the 
unobligated balances which had built up over the past decade 
and give the Department of State a greater incentive to: (1) 
closely monitor ongoing capital projects at each phase of the 
process--acquisition, design, construction, closeout, and 
projected fitting--to ensure that they are completed on time 
and within budget; and (2) sell surplus property that may no 
longer be needed. The proceeds from the sale of overseas State 
Department property reverts to this account.
    Overseas real estate.--While management of this account has 
improved in recent years, an April 1996 General Accounting 
Office [GAO] report suggests that more needs to be done. In 
fiscal year 1995, State sold $53,000,000 of its international 
real estate holdings and currently has an estimated 475,000,000 
dollars' worth of properties listed for sale. In addition to 
these properties, GAO identified 39 additional surplus 
properties worth more than $1,000,000 each. The GAO report 
recommended that ``the Secretary of State establish an 
independent panel to make recommendations regarding the sale of 
excess real estate to reduce the current inventory of 
property.''
    While the Committee supports the thrust of GAO's findings, 
it is concerned that directing State to unload what GAO has 
identified as surplus overseas properties without adequate 
knowledge of market conditions in those countries could cost 
taxpayers millions of dollars.
    The Committee directs that by no later than December 30, 
1996, the Secretary establish a nine-member advisory board on 
real property management. In addition to representatives from 
the State Department, the board must include at least one 
representative from the Office of the Inspector General [OIG], 
at least one from GAO, at least one from the Office of 
Management and Budget, and at least two private sector 
individuals with significant overseas real estate experience.
    The Board is to (1) review information on Department of 
State properties proposed for sale by the Department of State, 
OIG, GAO, or any other agencies of the U.S. Government, and (2) 
compile a list of properties recommended for sale to the Under 
Secretary of State for Management for approval. Once approved, 
this listing is to be included by the Department in its annual 
budget submission to Congress. In addition, the Board is to 
establish a priority listing of overseas capital projects which 
is to be updated annually.
    At any time when appropriate market conditions exist, State 
is to proceed with the immediate sale of items on the approved 
list. The first $25,000,000 in proceeds from the sale of these 
assets is to be used for priority facility rehabilitation 
projects as identified by the Department of State. The balance 
is to go to new capital projects consistent with priorities 
contained in the board's recommendations as approved by the 
Under Secretary for Management.
    The Committee recommendation includes a provision carried 
in the bill in previous years which prohibits funds from being 
used for acquisition of furniture and furnishings and 
generators for other departments and agencies.

           Emergencies In The Diplomatic And Consular Service

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $6,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       5,800,000
House allowance.........................................       5,800,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               5,800,000

    The Committee recommends $5,800,000 to enable the Secretary 
of State to meet unforeseen emergencies arising in the 
Diplomatic and Consular Service. The recommendation is 
identical to both the budget request and the House allowance. 
It is $200,000 less than the amount appropriated for fiscal 
year 1996.
    The Committee has continued a provision from the fiscal 
year 1996 appropriation permitting up to $1,000,000 to be 
transferred from this account to the ``Repatriation loans 
program'' account to ensure an adequate level of resources for 
loans to American citizens through the ``Repatriation loans 
program'' account should that account require additional funds 
in fiscal year 1997 due to an unanticipated increase in the 
number of loans needed.
    The appropriation provides resources for the Department of 
State to meet emergency requirements in the conduct of foreign 
affairs. The Committee recommendation provides funds for: (1) 
travel and subsistence expenses for relocation of American, 
U.S. Government employees and their families from troubled 
areas to the United States and/or safe-haven posts; (2) 
allowances granted to State Department employees and their 
dependents evacuated to the United States for the convenience 
of the Government; and (3) payment of rewards for information 
concerning terrorist and narcoterrorist activities.

                   Repatriation Loans Program Account

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $776,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       1,256,000
House allowance.........................................       1,256,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               1,256,000

    The Committee has included $593,000 for the subsidy cost of 
repatriation loans, and $663,000 for administrative costs of 
the program as authorized by 22 U.S.C. 2671. The Committee has 
agreed to include a recommendation contained in the budget 
request proposed by the inspector general and adopted by the 
House, which would reflect the full cost of administering the 
``Repatriation Loans Program'' account within this 
appropriation. As a result of this change, the recommendation 
is $480,000 more than the 1996 appropriation. Previously, 
administrative costs for this account were considered to 
include only incremental costs incurred as a result of 
implementing the Credit Reform Act. The change is not an 
increase in costs, but rather a transfer in funding 
responsibilities for costs previously funded by the salaries 
and expenses appropriation.
    This account provides emergency loans to assist destitute 
Americans abroad who have no other source of funds to return to 
the United States.

              Payment To The American Institute In Taiwan

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $15,165,000

                                                              14,165,000

    The accompanying bill includes $14,165,000 for the 
appropriation entitled, ``Payment to the American Institute in 
Taiwan'', the full amount authorized in the conference report 
to accompany H.R. 1561, Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1996-97.
    The Taiwan Relations Act requires that programs concerning 
Taiwan be carried out by the American Institute in Taiwan and 
authorizes funds to be appropriated to the Secretary of State 
to carry out the provisions of the act. The Institute 
administers programs in the areas of economic and commercial 
services, cultural affairs, travel services, and logistics. The 
Department of State contracts with the American Institute in 
Taiwan to carry out these activities.

    The Committee recommends $126,491,000 for the appropriation 
entitled ``Payment to the Foreign Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund.'' The recommendation for this account equals 
the budget request and the House allowance.
    This appropriation, which is considered mandatory for 
budget scorekeeping purposes, is authorized by the Foreign 
Service Act of 1980 which provides for an appropriation to the 
fund in 30 equal annual installments of the amount required for 
the unfunded liability created by new benefits, new groups of 
beneficiaries, or increased salaries on which benefits are 
computed.

Committee recommendation

                                                             550,000,000

    The bill includes $550,000,000 for payment of the 
obligations of U.S. membership in international organizations 
as authorized by conventions, treaties, or specific acts of 
Congress. This is $342,000,000 below the fiscal year 1996 
appropriation, $495,000,000 below the budget request, 
$325,000,000 below the House allowance, and $290,000,000 below 
the amount authorized in the conference report to accompany 
H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal 
Years 1996-97. The recommendation includes no funds for payment 
of arrearages.
    The Committee notes that since fiscal year 1992, funding 
for State Department operations has declined from 
$2,727,299,000 to a requested $2,713,133,000 for fiscal year 
1997. Over the same period, requested funding for international 
organizations has increased 20 percent (from $842,384,000 in 
fiscal year 1992 to a requested $1,045,000,000 for fiscal year 
1997). During deliberations on the fiscal year 1996 
appropriation, Congress made it clear, on a bipartisan, 
bicameral basis, that maintaining an adequate platform for U.S. 
foreign policy is a higher priority than funding continued 
membership in several of the 50 international organizations for 
which the United States will be assessed contributions in 
fiscal year 1997. The Committee recommendation reflects those 
priorities.
    United Nations reform.--The centerpiece of the 
administration's current United Nations [U.N.] reform plan is 
the $2,068,000,000 no-growth 1996-97 biennial budget for the 
United Nations adopted in December 1995. At a May 23 
subcommittee hearing, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the 
United Nations, Madeleine Albright, testified, ``There is at 
the heart of our budget request this year a plan to pay to the 
United Nations and affiliated agencies the amounts we owe for 
prior-year assessments. The total, about $1,000,000,000, would 
be paid in roughly equal installments over 5 years as the 
United Nations reforms, keeps its budget down, and cuts 
unnecessary staff.'' Over the past 10 years, bipartisan efforts 
to produce reform at the United Nations have yielded little in 
the way of results. While the Committee shares many of the 
administration's goals for U.N. reform, a review of past 
attempts to reform the United Nations strongly suggests that 
the administration's pay now, reform later policy is 
fundamentally flawed.
    The Committee notes that the U.N.'s no-growth budget is 
based on two assumptions. The first is that $154,000,000 in 
unidentified spending reductions will be adopted. The second is 
that any additional missions or activities which were not 
included in the original budget plan will be fully offset with 
additional spending reductions. Five months into the biennium 
the United Nations is currently between $179,000,000 and 
$274,000,000 (8.7 percent to 13.2 percent) over budget. None of 
the promised $154,000,000 in spending cuts have been adopted. 
In addition, the United Nations has voted--with U.S. support--
to extend several operations slated to expire this year without 
adopting offsetting spending cuts.
    Only when the Secretary of State can certify that the 
United Nations has fulfilled its commitment to a no-growth 
budget will the Committee consider making arrearage payments to 
the United Nations. In the interim, the recommendation provides 
sufficient funds to cover the full 25-percent U.S. commitment 
for fiscal year 1997, provided that the four quarterly 
certifications that the United Nations is not exceeding its no-
growth budget are made.
    Review of administrative costs.--The Committee is concerned 
that a large and growing percentage of funding provided for 
international organizations is devoted to overhead and 
administrative costs. Over the past several years, Congress has 
rigorously reviewed Federal programs in an effort to minimize 
administrative expenses and maximize the percentage of taxpayer 
dollars dedicated to program delivery. The Committee believes 
that international organizations should be held to the same 
standards. The Committee requested that the State Department 
review the budget of each international organization for which 
the United States is assessed contributions and determine what 
percentage of each organization's budget is allocated to 
administrative expenses and what percentage goes to program 
delivery. Because the response was woefully inadequate, the 
Committee now directs the State Department to complete a 
thorough review of the budgets of these international 
organizations and report its findings to the Committee by no 
later than December 1, 1996. At a minimum, the report should 
contain historical data comparing the staffing levels, salaries 
and other compensation, and program levels for each 
organization over the past 5 years.
    The recommendation includes language similar to that 
contained in the fiscal year 1996 appropriation withholding 
$100,000,000 of the total provided, with $25,000,000 
installments to be made available each quarter if the Secretary 
of State certifies that the United Nations has taken no action 
to increase funding for any U.N. program without identifying an 
offsetting decrease elsewhere in the U.N. budget and cause the 
United Nations to exceed its no-growth budget for the biennium 
1996-97 adopted in December 1995. If at any time, the Secretary 
is unable to make such a certification, the $25,000,000 is to 
be applied to reducing the United States' fiscal year 1998 
obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 
the World Trade Organization [WTO], or the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization [NATO] subject to the reprogramming 
requirements outlined in section 605 of this bill.
    From within the funds provided under this heading, funding 
is intended to be provided to fully fund fiscal year 1997 
assessments to IAEA, WTO, NATO, and the International Civil 
Aviation Organization [ICAO]. Funding is provided to the United 
Nations to cover the full fiscal year 1997 assessment at the 
25-percent assessment rate, provided that the certifications 
that the United Nations is not overspending its no-growth 
budget are made. No funds are to be provided to the U.N. 
Industrial Development Organization, the Inter-American Indian 
Institute, the Pan American Railway Congress Association, the 
Permanent International Association of Road Congresses, the 
International Tropical Timber Organization, the International 
Rubber Organization, or the World Tourism Organization. Should 
the recommended funding level fall short of actual assessments, 
the shortfall should be allocated among the remaining 
organizations and be prioritized according to the importance of 
each international organization to the national interest of the 
United States.
    International Civil Aviation Organization.--As part of its 
comprehensive counterterrorism initiative, the Committee 
recommends full funding of the fiscal year 1997 assessment for 
ICAO and urges the U.S. delegation to place increased emphasis 
on international flight safety and airport security.
    Framework Convention on Climate Change.--The Committee is 
aware of U.S. participation in negotiations on global climate 
change. The Committee is concerned about the pace at which the 
negotiations with parties to the 1992 Framework Convention on 
Climate Change [FCCC] are going. In March 1995, the State 
Department delegation to the FCCC agreed to a decision to 
finalize agreement on a protocol or other legal instrument to 
the convention by 1997. Any new agreement would cover 
greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations in the atmosphere 
for the post-2000 time period. The Committee notes that any 
such agreement would apply only to developed countries such as 
the United States.
    The Committee is concerned that the 1997 deadline will not 
allow for a thorough review of any proposed change in 
commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The FCCC 
requires that any proposed protocol or amendment to the 
convention be communicated to the parties at least 6 months 
prior to its consideration for adoption. Therefore, the 
Committee expects the State Department negotiating delegation 
to insist that at least 6 months be provided for study of final 
negotiating text of any proposed protocol or amendment to the 
FCCC. Because any agreement imposing binding targets for 
reductions within specified time periods will have a 
significant impact on U.S. trade, competitiveness, and jobs, 
the Committee directs that a comprehensive economic impact 
analysis be prepared to evaluate any proposed agreement.
    The Committee expects the State Department and other 
relevant agencies to keep this Committee and the other 
appropriate legislative and appropriation committees of 
Congress informed as to the U.S. negotiating position and 
strategy. The Committee suggests formal consultation with NGO's 
and U.S. businesses may be required to ensure that the 
negotiating position accurately reflects U.S. national 
interests. It is clear that a decision to adhere to binding 
targets and timetables would be a substantial and significant 
change in the FCCC commitments. The Committee believes that any 
decision to modify the commitments under the FCCC would have to 
be re-submitted for the Senate's advice and consent.
    Conferences.--The U.S. representative to the United Nations 
and others have stated that there should be no more worldwide 
conferences scheduled. The Committee agrees, and believes that 
the United States should not agree to participate in or finance 
any further worldwide conferences.
    The Committee also recommends bill language carried in 
previous appropriations acts which prohibits any of the funds 
made available in this account for a U.S. contribution to an 
international organization for the U.S. share of interest costs 
for loans incurred on or after October 1, 1984, through 
external borrowings.

        Contributions For International Peacekeeping Activities

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $359,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     425,000,000
House allowance.........................................     332,400,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             282,600,000

    The Committee recommends a total of $282,600,000 for U.S. 
payments for contributions for international peacekeeping 
activities for fiscal year 1997. This funding level represents 
the full fiscal year 1997 U.S. obligation to the United Nations 
[U.N.] for fiscal year 1997 peacekeeping activities. The 
recommendation is $92,400,000 below the amount authorized for 
fiscal year 1997 for this account in the conference report to 
accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1996-97. The recommendation does not include 
$142,400,000 requested by the administration to begin reducing 
U.S. arrearages for past U.N. peacekeeping operations.
    The recommendation continues language contained in Public 
Law 104-134 requiring a 15-day advance notice of votes in the 
U.N. Security Council for new or expanded peacekeeping missions 
and requiring a certification that American businesses are 
being given equal procurement opportunities.
    The requirement that the State Department submit a 
reprogramming, identifying the source of funds for a new or 
expanded mission is continued from the 1996 appropriation. The 
Committee is concerned that the administration has continued to 
commit the United States to paying huge sums in assessments 
without identifying where the funds will be found to pay for 
those commitments. Even though the administration's 
peacekeeping policy directive, Presidential Decision Directive 
25, makes availability of funds a factor in deciding whether to 
vote for a peacekeeping operation, the administration has 
continued to vote for peacekeeping missions without formulating 
a proposal identifying how the U.S. assessment will be 
financed.
    Language is included, as in the previous year, that 
prohibits the use of funds for any U.N. peacekeeping mission 
that involves U.S. Armed Forces under the command or 
operational control of a foreign national, unless the President 
certifies that the involvement is in the national security 
interest.
    Unreimbursable costs.--In 1994, the most recent year for 
which the State Department can provide data, the United States 
unreimbursed expenses exceeded our formal assessment by nearly 
40 percent. The United Nations has failed to properly and 
fairly credit the United States for these contributions and the 
Committee believes that the United States should be reimbursed 
for these contributions or credited for our assessed 
contribution.
    The Committee directs the U.S. Ambassador to the United 
Nations to work with the United Nations to analyze and review 
the U.N. peacekeeping scale of assessment. The four groupings 
that are currently being used by the United Nations do not 
reflect a proportionate share of the burden of peacekeeping 
costs. Several countries should be asked to pay a greater 
portion of the cost of peacekeeping operations.

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The Committee does not recommend separate funding to 
finance the U.S. participation in multilateral 
intergovernmental conferences and contributions to new or 
provisional international organizations.
    The Committee urges the Department to do a more rigorous 
job of prioritizing which of the approximately 700 scheduled 
conferences it chooses to attend, and of limiting the number of 
representatives.
    A September 1994 State Department inspector general report 
recommended that the Department consult with the Office of 
Management and Budget [OMB] to seek to expand the authority of 
the Office of International Conferences to monitor overall 
costs to the U.S. Government as well as the size and 
composition of conference delegations. The Committee recommends 
that the Department implement that recommendation.
    New or provisional organizations.--The other purpose of 
this account is to provide contingency funds for new or 
provisional international organizations. The Committee concurs 
in the action taken by the House to include language under the 
``Contributions to international organizations'' account to 
allow the transfer of up to $10,000,000 to this account for the 
purpose of providing such funds.

    The bill includes a total of $26,058,000 for the 
International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and 
Mexico [IBWC]. This amount is $2,314,000 less than the fiscal 
year 1997 authorization in the conference report to accompany 
H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal 
Years 1996-97. The total amount provided includes $18,490,000 
for salaries and expenses and $7,568,000 for construction.

    The Committee recommends $18,490,000 for the ``Salaries and 
expenses'' account. This amount is $1,782,000 below the fiscal 
year 1997 authorization contained in the conference report to 
accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1996-97.
    The recommendation for this account includes requested 
funding of $6,472,000 to operate and maintain the new South Bay 
International Sewage Treatment Plant scheduled to begin 
operation in fiscal year 1997 at partial capacity.

    The Committee recommendation for the construction 
appropriation is $7,568,000.
    Funds are provided for several projects along the United 
States-Mexican border, including the American Canal extension, 
the Rio Grande canalization project, and requested facilities 
renovation projects.
    The Committee would like to see IBWC fulfill its existing 
agreements to reimburse local governments for operation, 
maintenance, and other related costs associated with treatment 
of waste water originating in Mexico. The Committee recognizes 
that concerns have been raised by local governments about costs 
eligible for reimbursement as they relate to waste water 
treatment. Therefore, IBWC is directed to submit to this 
Committee, within 60 days after enactment of this legislation, 
a report detailing the historical context in which memorandums 
of agreement for waste water treatment have been entered, 
concerns raised by local governments that would affect 
reimbursement to the locality, and recommendations for 
resolution of the aforementioned concerns.

    The Committee recommends a total of $5,627,000 to fund the 
United States share of expenses of the International Boundary 
Commission, the International Joint Commission, United States 
and Canada, and the Border Environment Cooperation Commission 
for fiscal year 1997.
    The Committee recommendation includes $1,746,000 for the 
third year of funding for the Border Environment Cooperation 
Commission [BECC], authorized under the legislation approving 
the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA]. This new 
Commission has been established to develop cooperative efforts 
to resolve environmental problems along the United States-
Mexico border. The Commission's purpose is to work with 
affected States, local communities, and nongovernmental 
organizations that propose environmental infrastructure 
projects by assessing technical and financial feasibility, 
evaluating environmental benefits, arranging public and private 
financing, and coordinating the development and implementation 
of these projects.

                                                               9,051,000

    The accompanying bill provides a total of $9,051,000 to 
fund the U.S. share of the expenses of international fisheries 
commissions, participation in the International Council for the 
Exploration of the Sea, participation in the North Pacific 
Marine Sciences Organization, travel expenses of the U.S. 
commissioners and their advisors, and salaries of non-
Government employees of the Pacific Salmon Commission for days 
actually worked as commissioners and panel members and 
alternates.
    The Committee recommendation would provide $2,735,000 for 
the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, $5,618,000 less than the 
request. The difference is the amount that is passed through to 
the Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of the Interior 
for sea lamprey eradication or paid to the Environmental 
Protection Agency for lampricide certification. The Committee 
does not believe it is the function of the State Department to 
undertake or oversee fishery programs, nor does it believe that 
this program fits within the purpose of this account, which is 
to pay for the administrative costs of international 
commissions. Like the House, the Committee recommends shifting 
funding for sea lamprey eradication to the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce.

    The Committee recommends no funding for the Asia Foundation 
for fiscal year 1997.
    The Asia Foundation is a nongovernmental grant making 
organization that supports democratization in Asia. The 
Committee notes that Senate bill 908, the Foreign Affairs 
Revitalization Act of 1995, as reported by the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee on June 9, 1995, urged the Foundation to 
aggressively pursue private funds to support its activities. 
The Committee shares that view.

    The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency advises and assists 
the President, the National Security Council, the Secretary of 
State, and other senior Government officials on arms control 
matters.
    The Committee recommends $30,000,000 for the basic 
operating expenses of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency 
[ACDA] for fiscal year 1997. The Committee notes that the 
fiscal year 1997 request assumed fiscal year 1996 funding of 
$45,700,000. That assumption was $8,000,000 more than the 
amount actually appropriated to ACDA in fiscal year 1996. The 
recommendation is identical to the fiscal year 1997 
authorization contained in the conference report to accompany 
H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal 
Years 1996-97.
    In fiscal year 1996, ACDA requested that $3,700,000 in 
funds previously provided for chemical weapons convention 
implementation be used instead to support ongoing ACDA 
operations. Congress agreed to that request on the condition 
that those resources would not be used to undertake new 
programs or to increase employment above levels on board at the 
time of enactment of the fiscal year 1996 appropriation.
    The Committee notes that there is a significant overlap of 
functions between ACDA and the State Department's Bureau of 
Political-Military Affairs. This was identified in both the 
Vice President's reinventing Government announcement and the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee report on Senate bill 908. 
The recommended spending reduction is directed at elimination 
of that overlap.

    The Committee recommends a total of $1,024,800,000 for the 
U.S. Information Agency [USIA] to carry out the information, 
educational, and cultural exchange activities of the Agency and 
international broadcasting operations. The Committee 
recommendation also provides for the requested appropriation of 
interest and earnings on the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship 
Program trust fund, the Israeli-Arab Scholarship Endowment 
Fund, and the American Studies Collections Endowment Fund.
    The Committee notes that the fall of the Berlin wall has 
had a dramatic impact on this Agency. Since 1994, USIA has 
eliminated roughly 2,500 Federal and grantee positions. One 
thousand of those positions will be eliminated in fiscal year 
1996. The details of the Committee's recommendations for the 
nine appropriations accounts of the USIA are outlined in the 
following paragraphs. These recommendations are at or below the 
authorization levels contained in the conference report to 
accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1996-97. In no case does the Committee's 
recommendation exceed those authorization levels.

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $445,645,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     468,016,000
House allowance.........................................     439,300,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             440,000,000

    The Committee recommends $440,000,000 for the salaries and 
expenses appropriation of the U.S. Information Agency [USIA]. 
This amount is identical to the fiscal year 1997 authorization 
contained in the conference report to accompany H.R. 1561, the 
Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1996-97. The 
recommendation is $5,645,000 below a freeze at fiscal year 1996 
funding levels, $28,016,000 below the request, and $700,000 
above the House allowance.
    The Committee recommendation includes the following 
limitations on the use of funds which have been carried in the 
bill in previous years: (1) $700,000 for temporary employees; 
(2) $25,000 for entertainment, including official receptions, 
as authorized by law; (3) $1,400,000 for representation abroad 
as authorized by law; (4) $7,615,000 to remain available until 
expended, in fees credited to this appropriation which are 
received in connection with English teaching, library, motion 
pictures, and publication programs as authorized by law; and 
(5) $1,100,000 to remain available until expended to carry out 
projects involving security construction and related 
improvements for agency facilities not physically located 
together with State Department facilities abroad.
    The recommended funding level will require reductions and 
consolidations in the operations of USIA beyond those 
envisioned in the budget request. USIA must take immediate 
steps to downsize those posts where staffing is not in accord 
with USIA's resource allocation grouping model.
    Since enactment of the United States International 
Broadcasting Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-236), USIA has 
undergone a significant reorganization, downsizing, and 
streamlining effort. The Committee believes that USIA should 
concentrate further personnel reductions in support staff in 
Washington, DC, rather than programming staff in the field.

                            Technology Fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $5,050,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      10,000,000
House allowance.........................................       5,050,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               5,050,000

    This account was created in fiscal year 1996 to help 
modernize USIA's nonbroadcasting computer and 
telecommunications infrastructure. This account largely 
replaces an investment strategy that had relied heavily on 
available year end funds.
    The Committee recommends $5,050,000 for the ``Technology 
fund'' account, compared to the budget request of $10,100,000. 
The recommendation represents the full amount authorized for 
fiscal year 1997 authorization for this account in the 
conference report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1996-97.

               Educational And Cultural Exchange Programs

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $200,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     202,412,000
House allowance.........................................     185,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             183,000,000

    The bill includes a total of $183,000,000 for the 
educational and cultural exchange programs of the U.S. 
Information Agency. The recommendation is identical to the 
fiscal year 1997 authorization for this account in the 
conference report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1996-97.
    The Committee notes that in fiscal year 1996, funding for 
exchange programs in the New Independent States [NIS] of the 
former Soviet Union was provided under the Foreign Operations 
appropriations bill.
    Consistent with the provisions of the conference report to 
accompany H.R. 1561, the Committee recommends that, of the 
funds provided in this account, $98,000,000 be made available 
for the Fulbright Program and that other exchange programs be 
supported from remaining funds.
    The Committee urges that the following exchange programs be 
supported within resources provided: Disability exchange 
clearinghouse, Congress Bundestag exchanges, South Pacific 
exchanges, United States/Mexico Conflict Resolution Center, the 
International Visitors Program, the Institute for 
Representative Government, Pepper scholarships, and Muskie 
fellowships.
    USIA shall disburse funds in the amount of $1,800,000 to 
the Mansfield Center for Pacific Affairs to cover the Center's 
costs in fully implementing the Mike Mansfield fellowships, 
including the posting of 8, 1996 fellows and their immediate 
families in Japan in order that the fellows may work in a 
Japanese Government agency for 1 year, preparation and training 
for 10, 1997 fellows, the recruitment and selection of 10, 1998 
fellows, and attendant administrative costs.
    The Committee notes that the fiscal year 1996 appropriation 
included the funding for the Xth Paralympiad, which will take 
place in 1996.
    Governmentwide review of exchanges.--In 1994-95, the latest 
year for which complete data is available, 38 U.S. Government 
departments and agencies contributed more than $1,600,000,000 
to support foreign exchange and training programs. Of that 
amount, USIA spent $388,000,000 for exchanges. USIA has little 
or no role in administering exchanges and training activities 
conducted by these other agencies. Tight budgetary constraints 
necessitate a thorough review of these activities to both 
eliminate duplication and overlap and ensure cost-effective, 
coordinated Federal support of exchanges.
    Within the total amount of funding provided, funding for 
exchange support activities is included. The Committee expects 
that a proposal for the distribution of the available resources 
among exchange programs will be submitted through the normal 
reprogramming process prior to final decisions being made.
    The Committee supports an open, competitive bidding process 
for all USIA exchange grant programs that ensures that small 
grass roots operations have an opportunity to compete for these 
grants. The Committee believes that an open, competitive 
process can ensure quality and still provide cost-effective 
support for exchanges. In addition, the Committee supports an 
equitable distribution of exchanges at all academic levels: 
high school, undergraduate, and graduate.

                 Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Program

           Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Program Trust Fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $509,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         600,000
House allowance.........................................         600,000

Committee recommendation

                                                                 600,000

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of interest and 
earnings in the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Program Trust 
Fund, authorized by the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Act of 
1990 (Public Law 101-454). The recommendation is identical to 
both the request and the House allowance. It is $91,000 more 
than the fiscal year 1996 appropriation. The Committee notes 
that the 1996 appropriation contained a permanent change in law 
stating that in addition to these funds, ``Eisenhower Exchange 
Fellowships, Inc. may use one-third of any earned but unused 
trust fund income from the period 1992 through 1995 for 
fellowship purposes in each of fiscal years 1996 through 
1998.'' The Committee intends that those funds continue to be 
made available as required by Public Law 104-134.
    The Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Act of 1990 authorized a 
permanent endowment for the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship 
Program. The act established the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship 
Program Trust Fund in the U.S. Treasury for these purposes. A 
total of $7,500,000 has been provided to establish a permanent 
endowment for the program, from which interest and earnings in 
the fund are appropriated to Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships, 
Inc.

                    Israeli-Arab Scholarship Program

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $397,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         400,000
House allowance.........................................         400,000

Committee recommendation

                                                                 400,000

    The Committee recommends language in the accompanying bill 
which will appropriate interest and earnings of the Israeli-
Arab Scholarship Endowment Fund totaling $400,000. The 
recommendation is equal to the budget request and the House 
allowance. It is $3,000 more than the fiscal year 1996 funding 
level.
    A permanent endowment of $4,978,500 for the fund was 
established in fiscal year 1992 with funds made available to 
the U.S. Information Agency under section 556(b) of the Foreign 
Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 1990, as amended. The income from the 
endowment is to be used for a program of scholarships for 
Israeli-Arabs to attend institutions of higher education in the 
United States.

                 International Broadcasting Operations

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $325,191,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     340,406,000
House allowance.........................................     321,925,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             325,000,000

    The Committee recommends $325,000,000 to carry out U.S. 
international broadcasting operations for fiscal year 1997. 
Since the Committee rejects the request made in the budget 
request and adopted by the House to fund broadcasting to Cuba 
within this account, the figures listed above represent funding 
levels for non-Cuba broadcasting operations.
    The recommendation does not include an earmark for Radio 
Free Asia as proposed by the House.
    Targeting State sponsors of terrorism.--The recommendation 
includes an additional $3,000,000 from the counterterrorism 
fund to international broadcasting operations to increase 
programming to countries the United States currently lists as 
sponsors of terrorism: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, 
Sudan, and Syria, as well as countries where American citizens 
and property are threatened by acts of terrorism.
    The bill language continues several provisions which were 
included in the fiscal year 1996 appropriation and repeated in 
the request: (1) not to exceed $1,000,000 of these funds shall 
remain available until expended; (2) not to exceed $51,000 may 
be used for official receptions and representation in the 
United States and abroad; and (3) that $250,000 in authorized 
fees can remain available until expended.

                          Broadcasting To Cuba

Appropriations, 1966....................................     $24,809,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      25,000,000
House allowance.........................................      13,775,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              25,000,000

    The Committee recommends $25,000,000 to continue funding 
for broadcasting to Cuba as a separate account in fiscal year 
1997. The recommendation is identical to the request, $191,000 
more than the fiscal year 1996 appropriation and $11,225,000 
more than the House allowance.
    The Committee opposes the House recommendation to 
discontinue funding for TV Marti.
    The Committee notes that the Broadcasting Board of 
Governors [BBG] plans to complete the relocation of Cuba 
broadcasting to south Florida, mandated in the fiscal year 1996 
appropriation, by March 1997. The Committee supports efforts to 
implement the move as expeditiously, efficiently, and cost 
effectively as possible and directs BBG to provide a formal 
timetable for the planned move by no later than August 1, 1996. 
The Committee expects the BBG to provide regular progress 
reports on the implementation of that plan. The Committee has 
included bill language similar to that included in the 1996 
appropriation stipulating that the incremental cost of the move 
is to be absorbed from funds available under the headings 
``International Broadcasting Operations'', ``Broadcasting to 
Cuba'', and ``Radio Construction''.

                           Radio Construction

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $40,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      39,164,000
House allowance.........................................      39,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              32,000,000

    The bill includes $32,000,000 in new budget authority for 
the ``Radio construction'' account for fiscal year 1997. Severe 
budgetary constraints prevent the Committee from providing 
funds for new construction in fiscal year 1997. The 
recommendation is intended to provide funding for necessary 
maintenance, improvements, replacements, and repairs; satellite 
and terrestrial program feeds; engineering support activities, 
broadcast facility leases, and land rentals. The Committee 
notes that according to information provided to the Committee 
on June 4, 1996, USIA currently estimates that there will be 
$4,000,000 or more in end-of-year unobligated balances in this 
account.
    The Committee urges USIA to seriously consider alternative, 
less-costly transmitter options for future deployment.

                            East-West Center

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $11,750,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       8,800,000
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                                              11,750,000

    The Committee recommends freezing funding for the East-West 
Center at the 1996 level. This recommendation is identical to 
the fiscal year 1997 authorization for this account contained 
in the conference report to accompany H.R. 1561, the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1996-97. The 
recommendation is $2,950,000 above the request and $11,750,000 
above the House allowance.

                           North/South Center

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $2,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         970,000
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                                               2,000,000

    The Committee recommends freezing funding for the continued 
support of the operations of the North/South Center at the 
fiscal year 1996 spending level. This is $1,030,000 more than 
the request, $2,000,000 more than the House allowance, and 
$1,000,000 less than the fiscal year 1997 authorization for 
this account contained in the conference report to accompany 
H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal 
Years 1996-97.

                    National Endowment For Democracy

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $30,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      30,000,000
House allowance.........................................      30,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The National Endowment for Democracy [NED] was originally 
established in 1984 during the days of the cold war as a 
public-private partnership to promote democratic movements 
behind the Iron Curtain. Limited U.S. Government funds were 
viewed as a way to help leverage private contributions, and 
were never envisioned as NED's sole source of funding. 
Originally, NED's components were to raise private donations 
and the public contributions were to act as starter capital. 
Since the cold war is over, the Committee believes the time has 
come to eliminate Federal funding for this program. Continued 
NED operations should be funded by private contributions.
    A majority--65 percent--of NED funding is provided to four 
core groups: the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the 
Republican and Democrat National Parties. The four core groups 
are given funds without competitive bidding. This practice of 
allocating grants among the four core groups creates the 
perception that NED grants are the result of political payoffs 
and are not distributed according to merit. The United States 
already spends billions of dollars to promote democracy through 
USIA and AID programs. USIA and AID's grants are given 
competitively and must be reviewed.

      General Provisions--Department of State and Related Agencies

    The Committee recommends the following general provisions 
that were included in the fiscal year 1996 appropriations act:
    Section 401 of the bill, as requested, permits funds 
appropriated in this act for the Department of State to be 
available for allowances and differentials as authorized by 
subchapter 59 of 5 U.S.C.; for services as authorized by 5 
U.S.C. 3109; and hire of passenger transportation pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 1343(b).
    Section 402 of the bill permits up to 5 percent of any 
appropriation made available in the bill for the Department of 
State and the U.S. Information Agency to be transferred between 
their respective appropriations. The language also provides 
that no appropriation shall be decreased by more than 5 percent 
or increased by more than 10 percent by any such transfer. In 
addition, the language provides that any transfer pursuant to 
this subsection shall be treated as a reprogramming of funds 
under section 605 of the accompanying bill and shall not be 
available for obligation or expenditure except in compliance 
with the procedures set forth in that section.
    Section 403 provides that funds appropriated or otherwise 
made available under this act or any other act may be expended 
for compensation of the United States Commissioner of the 
International Boundary Commission, United States and Canada, 
only for actual hours worked by such Commissioner.
    Section 404 waives through September 30, 1997, provisions 
of existing law that require authorizations to be in place for 
State Department, U.S. Information Agency, including 
international broadcasting operations, and Arms Control and 
Disarmament Agency activities prior to the expenditure of any 
appropriated funds.
    Section 405 provides that any personnel costs incurred by 
any Department or agency funded under this title as a result of 
funding reductions be absorbed within the total budgetary 
resources available to the Department or agency. In addition, 
this section grants any Department or agency funded under this 
title the authority to transfer funds between appropriations 
accounts for these personnel costs subject to standard 
reprogramming procedures.
    The recommendation does not include section 406 of the 
House bill regarding modifications to treaties after their 
ratification by the U.S. Senate.
                       TITLE V--RELATED AGENCIES

                      DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

                        Maritime Administration

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $156,100,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     222,097,000
House allowance.........................................     166,200,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             107,500,000

    The Maritime Administration in the Department of 
Transportation is responsible for administering several 
programs for the maritime industry relating to U.S. foreign and 
domestic commerce, and for national defense purposes.
    The Committee recommendation provides a total of 
$107,500,000 in new budget authority, plus an additional 
$148,430,000 for liquidation of contract authority, for the 
Maritime Administration for fiscal year 1997. The Committee's 
recommendations for specific accounts within the Maritime 
Administration are described in more detail below.

                    Operating-Differential Subsidies

            (Appropriation to Liquidate Contract Authority)

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $162,610,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     148,430,000
House allowance.........................................     148,430,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             148,430,000

    The Committee recommends $148,430,000 for payment of 
obligations incurred for operating-differential subsidies of 
American flag vessels. This amount is the full request, and 
represents a decrease of $14,180,000 below the amount made 
available for the program in fiscal year 1996. This amount does 
not score against the Committee's 602(b) allocation for budget 
authority or outlays. The Committee is providing for 
liquidation of subsidy contracts which will be expiring within 
the next 5 years.

                       Maritime Security Program

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $46,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     100,000,000
House allowance.........................................      63,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The proposed Maritime Security Program is intended to help 
maintain and preserve a U.S. flag merchant fleet to serve the 
national security needs of the United States. This program is 
funded under the allocations for national security programs.
    The Committee recommends no new funding for the Maritime 
Security Program for fiscal year 1997. This program received an 
appropriation of $46,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 pending 
enactment of an authorizing law. Because this authorization has 
yet to be enacted, it is estimated that all of those prior-year 
funds in this account will carry over for use in fiscal year 
1997.

                        Operations And Training

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $66,600,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      78,097,000
House allowance.........................................      62,300,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              66,600,000

    This account funds operations of the Maritime 
Administration [MarAd], the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, and 
provides grants to State maritime academies.
    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $66,600,000 to 
fund programs under this account. This amount is a reduction of 
$11,497,000 from the budget request, is the same as the amount 
appropriated for the current fiscal year, and is $4,300,000 
more than the House allowance.
    The Committee does not concur in the House report language 
for this account, and provide's that not less than $8,500,000 
is for State maritime schools. The majority of this amount is 
dedicated to maintenance and utilization of federally owned 
training ships. The balance of the funds are to be used at the 
discretion of the MarAd Administrator for training, operating 
programs, and general administration of the Maritime 
Administration.

                    Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $43,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      44,000,000
House allowance.........................................      40,900,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              40,900,000

    The Committee has provided a total of $40,900,000 for the 
Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program (title XI) Program. This level 
is $3,100,000 less than the budget request, is $2,600,000 less 
than the current level, and is the same as the House allowance. 
Included within this amount is $37,450,000 in subsidies for the 
guaranteed loan program. This program provides guaranteed loans 
for purchasers of vessels worked on in U.S. shipyards, and for 
U.S. shipyard modernization and improvement projects, such as 
those being proposed at the Port of Portland ship repair yard.
    In addition to the loan subsidy amount, $3,450,000 is 
provided from the total amount for administrative expenses 
related to the title XI program. This amount is a reduction of 
$550,000 below the budget request, $50,000 below the current 
level, and is the same as the House allowance. This amount may 
be transferred to and merged with appropriations for MarAd 
operations and training to cover the common overhead expenses 
associated with maritime guaranteed loans.

                       Administrative Provisions

    The bill includes provisions regarding: (1) Government 
property controlled by MarAd, (2) accounting for certain funds 
received by MarAd, and (3) a prohibition on obligations from 
the MarAd construction fund. These provisions have been carried 
in appropriations acts for the Maritime Administration for 
several years.

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The Committee recommendation does not include funding for 
this new Commission.

      Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $206,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         206,000
House allowance.........................................         206,000

Committee recommendation

                                                                 206,000

    The Committee recommends $206,000 for the expenses of the 
Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad. 
This amount is the same as the budget request, the House 
allowance, and the fiscal year 1996 funding level. The 
recommendation will allow the Commission to fund its 
administrative expenses through appropriated funds while 
relying on privately donated funds for the actual purchase and 
restoration of property.
    The purpose of the Commission is to encourage the 
preservation of cemeteries, monuments, and historic buildings 
associated with the foreign heritage of the American people.

                       Commission on Civil Rights

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $8,750,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      11,400,000
House allowance.........................................       8,740,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               8,740,000

    The Committee recommends $8,740,000 for the salaries and 
expenses of the Commission on Civil Rights.
    The Committee continues language providing: (1) $50,000 to 
employ consultants; (2) a prohibition against reimbursing 
commissioners for more than 75 billable days with the exception 
of the Chairman who is permitted 125 billable days; and (3) a 
limitation of four full-time positions under schedule C of the 
excepted service exclusive of one special assistant for each 
Commissioner.
    The Committee believes that the Commission can augment its 
resources for factfinding and research activities with detailed 
employees from agencies with expertise in civil rights and 
related matters.

                    Commission on Immigration Reform

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $1,894,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       2,498,000
House allowance.........................................       2,196,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               2,196,000

    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $2,196,000 for 
fiscal year 1997 for the Commission on Immigration Reform.
    The Commission's mandate is to review and evaluate the 
impact of U.S. immigration policy and to transmit to the 
Congress a report of its findings and recommendations for 
additional changes that should be made with respect to 
immigration into the United States. The Commission must report 
to the Congress on September 30, 1997, and is slated to sunset 
on January 1, 1998.

            Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $1,090,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       1,090,000
House allowance.........................................       1,090,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               1,090,000

    The Committee recommends a freeze on funding for the 
Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] at 
fiscal year 1996 levels, the same as the budget request.
    The Commission was established in 1976 to monitor 
compliance with the final act of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe with particular regard to provisions 
dealing with humanitarian affairs.
    This level of funding will allow the CSCE to continue its 
mission.

                     Competitiveness Policy Council

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................         $50,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................         897,000
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The Competitiveness Policy Council [CPC] was a 12-member 
advisory committee which created several reports on issues of 
global economic competitiveness. The fiscal year 1996 
appropriation (Public Law 104-134) provided $50,000 to CPC 
provided that: ``this shall be the final Federal payment to the 
Competitiveness Policy Council.'' The recommendation is 
consistent with that legal requirement.

                Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $233,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     268,000,000
House allowance.........................................     239,740,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             239,740,000

    The Committee recommends $239,740,000 for the salaries and 
expenses of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] 
for fiscal year 1997.
    The bill also includes language included in previous 
appropriations acts allowing: (1) nonmonetary awards to private 
citizens; (2) up to $30,000,000 for payments to State and local 
agencies; and (3) up to $2,500 for official reception and 
representation expenses.
    The Committee supports the recent changes adopted by the 
EEOC to use mediation-based alternatives for resolving disputes 
in some cases and to prioritize and categorize charges based on 
new charge handling procedures. These efforts may have a 
considerable effect on the workload of the EEOC and the 
Committee notes that the increases proposed for the EEOC were 
requested prior to the implementation of these new procedures. 
The Committee expects the EEOC to continue its examination of 
alternatives to case processing in order to decrease its 
backlog of cases and reduce the rate of incoming casework.
    The Committee has increased payments to State and local 
human rights commissions in recognition of the fact that they 
handle almost one-half of the EEOC's caseload.

                   Federal Communications Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $185,709,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     222,538,000
House allowance.........................................     185,619,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             192,538,000

    The Committee recommends a total program level of 
$192,538,000 for the salaries and expenses of the Federal 
Communications Commission [FCC], of which $152,523,000 is to be 
derived from collection of existing section 9 fees as proposed 
by the administration. The remaining $40,015,000 would be 
funded from direct appropriations. The Committee recommendation 
fully funds requested increases for implementation of the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, but denies $30,000,000 
requested for relocating FCC headquarters to the portals in 
Washington, DC.
    The recommendation would increase the FCC operating budget 
by $6,829,000 over fiscal year 1996 levels but reduces FCC 
funding from direct appropriations by $19,294,000. The 
recommendation is $30,000,000 below the request.
    The Committee also recommends bill language, similar to 
that included in previous appropriations acts, which allows: 
(1) up to $600,000 for land and structures; (2) up to $500,000 
for care of grounds and buildings; (3) up to $4,000 for 
official reception and representation expenses; (4) up to 
$300,000 for research and policy studies to remain available 
until September 30, 1998; (5) authority to purchase uniforms 
and acquire vehicles; (6) special counsel fees; (7) for the 
collection of $152,523,000 in section 9 fees; (8) for the sum 
appropriated to be reduced as section 9 fees are collected; and 
(9) fees collected in excess of $152,523,000 to be available in 
fiscal year 1998.
    As it did in 1996, the Committee recommends denying 
requested increases related to the cost of relocating the FCC 
headquarters into consolidated new space. The fiscal year 1997 
request for these costs is $30,000,000 and the FCC anticipates 
that an additional $10,000,000 would be required in fiscal year 
1998. Language is included which prohibits funding provided to 
the FCC from being used to finance the proposed move.

                      Federal Maritime Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $14,855,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................      15,000,000
House allowance.........................................      11,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                              14,450,000

    The Federal Maritime Commission [FMC] is an independent 
regulatory agency charged with administering several acts of 
law relating to the waterborne domestic and foreign offshore 
commerce of the United States.
    Legislation is currently being considered in the House and 
Senate to eliminate this agency and transfer its functions 
elsewhere. In addition, the conference report on the fiscal 
year 1997 budget resolution assumes elimination of this agency. 
However, the Senate Commerce Committee has yet to report out a 
bill reforming the FMC.
    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $14,450,000 
for fiscal year 1997. The recommended amount is $405,000 below 
the current year funding, and is $550,000 below the budget 
request.

                        Federal Trade Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................     $98,928,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     104,462,000
House allowance.........................................      93,819,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             104,462,000

    The Federal Trade Commission [FTC] administers a variety of 
Federal antitrust and consumer protection laws. Activities in 
the antitrust area include detection and elimination of illegal 
collusion, anticompetitive mergers, unlawful single-firm 
conduct, and injurious vertical agreements. In addressing fraud 
and other consumer concerns, the FTC regulates advertising 
practices, service industry practices, marketing practices, and 
credit practices.
    The Committee recommends total budget (obligational) 
authority of $104,462,000 for the salaries and expenses of the 
Federal Trade Commission for fiscal year 1997. This 
recommendation is the full requested amount for fiscal year 
1997, is $5,534,000 more than the amount provided in the 
current year, and is $10,643,000 more than the House allowance. 
The full amount provided will be derived from anticipated 
offsetting fee collections in fiscal year 1997, resulting in no 
new net direct appropriation for this account. The Committee 
notes that use of unobligated fee collections from the prior 
year are subject to the reprogramming requirements outlined in 
section 605 of this act.
    The recommendation includes bill language that changes the 
current Hart-Scott-Rodino filing fee structure from a flat fee 
to a graduated fee scale. This structure reduces the amount of 
the fee for acquiring companies with assets of $100,000,000 or 
less, and increases the fees on larger companies; this is 
intended to reduce the burden on small business, while more 
accurately reflecting the enforcement workload of the Antitrust 
Division and the Federal Trade Commission.
    The Committee recommends bill language, similar to that 
included in previous appropriations acts, which: (1) allows for 
purchase of uniforms and hire of motor vehicles; (2) allows up 
to $2,000 for official reception and representation expenses; 
(3) allows for the collection of fees; (4) allows for the sum 
appropriated to be reduced as fees are collected; (5) allows 
fees in excess of the amount designated in the bill to be 
available in fiscal year 1998; (6) prohibits the use of funds 
to implement section 151 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation Improvements Act of 1991; and (7) allows the FTC to 
contract for private debt collection services.

                    Gambling Impact Study Commission

                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................................
Budget estimate, 1997...................................................

Committee recommendation

                                                              $2,000,000

    The Committee recommendation provides $2,000,000 for the 
National Gambling Impact Study Commission. This appropriation 
is provided subject to the authorization of this commission. 
Legislation establishing the commission has passed the House 
and the Senate, and is awaiting Presidential signature at this 
time. The purpose of the commission is to conduct comprehensive 
studies on various issues relating to the impacts of gambling 
in the United States.

               Japan-United States Friendship Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $1,247,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       1,250,000
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                                               1,250,000

    The Committee recommends $1,250,000 for the expenses of the 
Japan-United States Friendship Commission for fiscal year 1997. 
This amount is $3,000 more than the level of funding provided 
in fiscal year 1996 and $1,250,000 above the House allowance. 
It is identical to the request. The bill also provides for an 
amount of Japanese currency not to exceed the equivalent of 
$1,420,000. In accordance with Public Law 94-118, the interest 
earned on the principal in the trust fund is subject to the 
annual appropriations process.
    The Committee intends that the funds provided be used for 
the promotion of scholarly, cultural, and business/economic 
relations between the United States and Japan.

                       Legal Services Corporation

               payment to the legal services corporation

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $278,000,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     340,000,000
House allowance.........................................     250,000,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             288,000,000

    The Committee recommends a total of $288,000,000 for the 
provision of civil legal services for fiscal year 1997. This is 
the same as the funding provided for the current fiscal year, 
and is $52,000,000 less than the amount requested by the 
administration. The Committee recommendation includes 
$279,400,000 for basic field programs, to be used for 
competitively awarded grants and contracts, $7,100,000 for 
management and administration, and $1,500,000 for the Office of 
the Inspector General. The Committee expects the Legal Services 
Corporation [LSC] to continue to distribute funding for basic 
legal services on a competitive award basis.

                       administrative provisions

    The Committee recommendation continues the administrative 
provisions contained in the fiscal year 1996 appropriations act 
(Public Law 104-134) regarding operation of this program to 
provide basic legal services to poor individuals. Upon 
enactment of an authorization relating to the Legal Services 
Corporation, all contradictory provisions within that 
authorization will supersede the provisions of this act.
    All administrative provisions from the 1996 appropriation 
relating to distribution of funding by formula according to the 
number of poor people residing in an area, with adjustments for 
certain isolated States and territories, and for native 
American communities, are continued in the Committee 
recommendation.
    In addition, the Committee recommendation continues all 
administrative provisions restricting the use of LSC funds. As 
in the past, grantees must agree not to engage in litigation 
and related activities with respect to a variety of matters 
including (1) redistricting; (2) class action suits; (3) 
representation of illegal aliens; (4) political activities; (5) 
collection of attorneys fees; (6) abortion; (7) prisoner 
litigation; (8) welfare reform; (9) representation of charged 
drug dealers during eviction proceedings; and (10) solicitation 
of clients. However, the Committee recommendation includes a 
new exception to the restrictions in a case where there is 
imminent threat of physical harm to the client or prospective 
client.
    The Committee recommendation also clarifies that the 
transition for cases involving attorneys fees remains in 
effect, and extends the language from last year providing for 
the manner in which LSC grantees are audited and the manner in 
which they contract with certified public accountants for 
financial and compliance audits.

                        Marine Mammal Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $1,190,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       1,334,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               1,385,000

    The Marine Mammal Commission was created under title II of 
the Marine Mammal Protection Act to provide independent 
science-based advice to the legislative and executive branches. 
The recommendation provides $1,385,000 for the Marine Mammal 
Commission in fiscal year 1997. This is the same level of 
funding as that provided in fiscal year 1995.

          Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................        $350,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................................
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The Committee recommends no funding for the Martin Luther 
King, Jr., Federal Holiday Commission. This is identical to the 
request and the House allowance. It is $350,000 less than the 
1996 funding level. The fiscal year 1996 appropriation (Public 
Law 104-134) contained language stating that ``this shall be 
the final Federal payment to the Martin Luther King, Jr., 
Federal Holiday Commission for operations and necessary 
closeout costs.''
    The Commission was originally established in order to 
encourage and promote appropriate ceremonies and activities 
throughout the United States related to the observance of the 
Federal legal holiday honoring Martin Luther King, Jr., and to 
provide assistance to Federal, State, and local governments and 
to private organizations concerning the observance of the 
holiday.

                 National Bankruptcy Review Commission

                         salaries and expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................................
Budget estimate, 1997...................................        $500,000
House allowance.........................................         490,000

Committee recommendation

                                                                 498,000

    The National Bankruptcy Review Commission was created to 
investigate and study issues related to the Bankruptcy Code, 
solicit views from parties concerned with the operation of the 
bankruptcy system, evaluate proposals, and submit a report of 
its findings to the President, Congress, and the Chief Justice 
by 1997.
    The Committee recommendation includes $498,000 for the 
Commission, $2,000 less than the request and the House 
allowance. No amount was requested in 1996. The Commission 
received an appropriation of $1,000,000 in fiscal year 1995 by 
a transfer from the Department of Justice working capital fund. 
The administration submitted a budget amendment on July 10, 
1996, requesting $500,000 in additional funds for the 
Commission in order to provide the complete authorized amount 
of funding in order for the Commission to complete its work.

                      Ounce of Prevention Council

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $1,500,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................................
    (Violent crime reduction trust fund)................       9,000,000
House allowance.........................................................

Committee recommendation

                                             ...........................

    The Committee does not recommend direct funding of the 
Ounce of Prevention Council.
    This funding is $1,500,000 below the 1996 funding level and 
$9,000,000 in violent crime reduction trust fund resources 
below the request.
    The Ounce of Prevention Council is intended to have two 
purposes--program coordination and grantmaking. The program 
coordination function includes the development of a crime 
prevention program catalogue and the creation of strategies for 
program integration and grant simplification. The Committee 
believes the coordination of prevention programs can be 
accomplished without the creation of another level of 
bureaucracy to carry out these types of activities, which 
cannot be justified within the context of streamlining and 
reinventing Government. The Office of Justice Programs 
currently funds the coordination of crime prevention efforts at 
the State and local levels through programs such as the 
National Crime Prevention Council which enjoys broad bipartisan 
support.
    The grantmaking function includes grants for summer and 
after school recreation programs, mentoring, programs assisting 
employability, and outreach programs for at-risk families. 
Grants of this nature are more appropriately funded by local 
governments or private organizations.

                   Securities and Exchange Commission

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $297,405,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     308,189,000
House allowance.........................................     297,021,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             306,400,000

    The Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC] is an 
independent agency responsible for administering many of the 
Nation's laws regulating the areas of securities and finance.
    The Committee recommendation provides total budget 
(obligational) authority of $306,400,000 for the Securities and 
Exchange Commission for fiscal year 1997. The recommended 
amount of budget authority is $1,789,000 below the request, and 
is $8,995,000 above current year funding.
    Of the recommended operating level of $306,400,000, the 
Committee provides a direct appropriation of $64,430,000. The 
recommendation reduces the section 6(b) registration fees to 
one thirty-third of 1 percent for fiscal year 1997. In fiscal 
year 1996, the level of fees was one twenty-ninth of 1 percent. 
The recommendation assumes that $163,479,000 will be available 
as an offset this year from 6(b) fees. The Committee also 
assumes that $30,495,000 in offsetting fees will be available 
from the expansion to NASDAQ of the section 31 transaction fee 
in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, the 
recommendation assumes that $48,000,000 in carryover balances 
from fiscal year 1996 will be available to help finance SEC 
operations in 1997.
    For fiscal year 1997, as during the current year, the 
Committee continues to emphasize the importance of the Office 
of Economic Analysis within the Commission and expects that 
adequate funds will be provided in order to carry out these 
important functions. The Committee recommends bill language, 
similar to that included in previous appropriations acts, 
which: (1) allows for the rental of space; (2) makes up to 
$3,000 available for official reception and representation 
expenses; (3) makes up to $10,000 available for a permanent 
secretariat for the International Organization of Securities 
Commissions; and (4) makes up to $100,000 available for 
expenses of meetings and consultations with foreign 
governmental and regulatory officials.

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $689,578,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     908,378,000
House allowance.........................................     683,212,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             698,919,000

    The Small Business Administration [SBA] is an independent 
agency created in 1953 to administer a group of Federal 
programs and policies focused on the Nation's small businesses.
    The Committee recommends total funding of $698,919,000 for 
the Small Business Administration for fiscal year 1997. This 
amount is an increase of $9,341,000 from the fiscal year 1996 
appropriation, which included $100,000,000 in supplemental 
disaster loan program funding. It is a reduction of 
$209,459,000 below the budget request, which also includes a 
request for $100,000,000 in disaster emergency contingency 
funding. This amount is distributed among the five SBA 
appropriation accounts as described below.

                         Salaries And Expenses

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $219,190,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     235,401,000
House allowance.........................................     214,419,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             233,190,000

    The Committee recommendation provides a direct 
appropriation of $233,190,000 for the salaries and expenses of 
the Small Business Administration. This amount is $2,211,000 
below the budget request, and is $14,000,000 more than the 
current funding level. Additional resources are offset by 
$3,300,000 in fees to be collected from the distribution of 
publications produced by the SBA. This results in budgetary 
authority of $236,490,000 for this appropriations account.
    In addition to the direct appropriation for the ``Salaries 
and expenses'' account, the full requested amount of 
$94,090,000 is available for this account from the portion of 
the ``Business loans program'' account for administrative 
expenses. In addition, another $78,000,000 is available from 
the portion of the ``Disaster Loans Program'' account for 
administrative expenses. These amounts are to be transferred to 
and merged with the ``Salaries and expenses'' account for a 
total of $408,580,000 in budgetary resources for this account.
    Streamlining and eliminating duplication.--In recent years, 
SBA has demonstrated that it can rely on its private sector 
resource partners to take on more responsibilities and play a 
larger role in delivering SBA programs. Today, SBA relies 
almost totally on its preferred lenders and LowDoc lenders to 
approve and process well over 50 percent of the loans 
guaranteed under the 7(a) guaranteed business loan program. To 
support this growing reliance on private sector lenders, last 
year SBA sought approval from Congress for centralizing the 
LowDoc loan processing function, and Congress approved two 
pilot LowDoc centers.
    The Committee concurs that SBA needs to move forward with a 
program to consolidate and streamline Agency activities. In 
March 1995, SBA presented a plan to the Committee to reduce the 
number of Agency offices, and the conferees directed SBA 
officials to work with the Senate and House Committees on 
Appropriations and Small Business to evaluate downsizing of 
headquarters and field operations. Last year, the Committee 
urged SBA to make better use of private sector professionals to 
perform certain Agency tasks. The Committee restates this view 
and directs SBA to move more rapidly in the areas of: (1) 
private sector servicing of disaster loans, (2) private sector 
liquidation of assets under the 7(a), SBIC, and 504 certified 
development company loan programs, and (3) private sector 
assistance in licensing, examinations, receivership, and other 
administrative activities under the SBIC program.
    In fiscal year 1995, over 8,000 lenders nationwide made 
loans under the 7(a) guaranteed business loan program. The list 
of participating lenders includes smaller community-based banks 
as well as national and regional lenders. In response to the 
increased demand by small businesses for 7(a) loans, in fiscal 
year 1996 the conferees approved funding to support nearly 
$11,000,000,000 in 7(a) loans.
    Increased loan volume has placed extra pressure on SBA to 
meet this growing demand. For the past year, small business 
lenders have complained it has been taking SBA 30 days or more 
to process applications under the LowDoc loan program, which is 
supposed to be a streamlined, quick turnaround program for 
small borrowers. Processing time for preferred lender loans has 
doubled in fiscal year 1996. Smaller, community-based banks are 
concerned this slow turnaround for loan approvals is 
jeopardizing its ability to meet small businesses' borrowing 
requirements. The Committee has been very supportive of the 
7(a) loan program. However, considering the increasing demand 
and significant growth in the program over the past 3 years, 
the Committee believes SBA can better deliver its 7(a) program 
by centralizing all loan processing, servicing, liquidation, 
and lender examination functions.
    In recent years, SBA has taken innovative steps to 
centralize some of its 7(a) loan program functions on a 
regional or national basis. In 1993, it made permanent its 
centralized loan servicing operations and added the Little 
Rock, AR, center to complement its Fresno, CA, servicing 
center. The Committee is encouraged by the success of its 
centralized servicing centers and its Sacramento-based 
preferred lenders center. More recently, SBA announced it has 
established a centralized preferred lender examination office 
in Kansas City.
    In light of the importance to the small business community 
of SBA's 7(a) guaranteed loan program, the Committee believes 
the Agency needs to continue to move forward in its efforts to 
streamline and consolidate its activities and to make better 
use of its private sector partners. To support these 
activities, the Committee has included $15,000,000 above the 
base amount for other operating expenses of the SBA to fund 
acquisition of computers and communications equipment. In 
addition, the Committee recommendation assumes that the SBA may 
allocate sufficient funds in retirement incentives to 
facilitate this downsizing. The Committee expects the 
streamlining and consolidation of program activities will allow 
the field offices to reduce staffing levels at these locations, 
and enable the remaining personnel to concentrate on outreach 
and other small business educational and support services. The 
Committee expects this streamlining effort to be completed by 
September 30, 1998.
    The funding provided under this account for salaries and 
expenses provides $78,000,000 for fiscal year 1997 for small 
business development centers [SBDC's]. The Committee rejects 
the proposal in the budget request to merge certain programs 
into the SBDC account and has provided funding for women-
related programs as discussed below. The recommendation 
provides $3,300,000 for the Service Corps of Retired Executives 
[SCORE], $1,600,000 for section 7(j) grants, $4,000,000 for the 
Women's Outreach Program, and $200,000 for the Women's Council. 
The Committee supports the continuation of funding for current 
and new demonstration sites. The Committee notes that special 
pilot projects, including private-public partnerships and a 
national demonstration site, would aid women business owners in 
the access to capital and the development of management and 
marketing skills which can be shared with other sites, and 
urges the Office to begin pursuing these objectives. The 
Committee does not expect these funds to be reprogrammed by SBA 
to other purposes. The Committee also provides $12,000,000 for 
microloan technical assistance, and $1,180,000 for advocay 
research. As noted in the fiscal year 1996 conference report, 
the Committee expects the SBA to to continue implementation of 
section 303 of Public Law 103-403 regarding manufacturing 
sciences and provides $1,500,000 for pilot projects in this 
area. In addition, $3,000,000 is provided to continue defense 
economic transition grants. The Committee does not agree with 
House language designating $3,000,000 for joint work with the 
Minority Business Development Agency [MBDA].
    The Committee supports the goal of increasing the success 
rate of small, minority-owned businesses. Programs under the 
SBA provide a vast delivery system of business assistance. For 
example, there are 976 SBDC's nationwide which served 125,100 
minority clients in 1995. The Committee expects SBDC's to 
continue to play a key role in light of funding cuts to 
duplicative functions under the ``Minority Business Development 
Agency'' account in title II of this report. Likewise, the 
Committee suggests that SBA explore ways to further enhance 
tribal business assistance as MBDA is downsizing. In addition, 
the Committee directs the Administrator to document a 
successful process for developing and sustaining a university-
industry partnership for providing mentoring and technical 
assistance to small, minority-owned businesses. Business 
outreach programs already exist at urban universities, such as 
Portland State University, which may serve as a model for this 
endeavor.
    Streamlining at SBA will demand the direction of resources 
to the most critical areas. The Committee directs the Small 
Business Administration, within the funds provided in this 
bill, to fill technical and support positions, including: two 
industrial specialists (forestry) and one clerical support 
staff in Portland, OR; and, one industrial specialist and one 
clerical support staff in Denver, CO. Additionally, the SBA is 
directed to maintain all funding and support for personnel 
currently working on procurement programs directly related to 
the oversight of the Small Business Timber Sale Set-Aside 
Program.
    The Committee recommendation includes requested language 
authorizing $3,500 for official reception and representation 
expenses and language authorizing SBA to charge fees to cover 
the cost of publications, and certain loan servicing 
activities. The language also permits revenues received from 
all such activities to be credited to the ``Salaries and 
expenses'' account to be available for carrying out these 
purposes without further appropriations. The Committee 
understands that fee collections may exceed prior estimates, 
and encourages SBA to use these funds, in addition to savings 
realized from streamlining, to fund initiatives described 
above.

    The Committee recommends $9,000,000 for the Office of 
Inspector General of the Small Business Administration. This 
amount is $500,000 more than current year funding, and $985,000 
below the amount requested.

                     Business Loans Program Account

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $253,348,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             309,199,000

    As required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, the 
Congress is required to appropriate an amount sufficient to 
cover the estimated losses associated with all direct loan 
obligations and loan guarantee commitments made in fiscal year 
1997, as well as the administrative expenses of the loans.
    The Committee recommends $309,199,000 for the ``Business 
loans program'' account for guaranteed business loans, 
including $94,090,000 for administrative expenses related to 
this account. The amount provided for administrative expenses 
may be transferred to and merged with the appropriation for SBA 
salaries and expenses to cover the common overhead expenses 
associated with business loans. The Committee recommendation 
provides $2,792,000 for direct loan programs as requested in 
the President's 1997 budget.
    Business loan guarantees.--For business loan guarantees, 
the Committee recommends a total of $212,317,000 for fiscal 
year 1997. This amount includes $174,500,000 for the 7(a) 
business loan program. The fiscal year 1996 appropriation was 
$114,500,000. In addition, the Committee assumes the use of 
$24,000,000 in carryover funding in the 7(a) program to provide 
a program volume of $7,400,000,000 unless legislation lowering 
the subsidy rate is approved. The Committee recommendation 
provides no new funding for the section 504 loan program as in 
the President's request, and expects legislation to be enacted 
providing for adequate loan volume. The Committee recommends 
$35,500,000 for Small Business Investment Company [SBIC] 
program, including $20,400,000 for the participating security 
program and $15,100,000 for the debenture program. In addition, 
$2,317,000 is provided for microloan guarantees for fiscal year 
1997.

                     Disaster Loans Program Account

Appropriations, 1996....................................    $206,010,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................     243,800,000
House allowance.........................................     198,010,000

Committee recommendation

                                                             143,800,000

    As required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, the 
Congress is required to appropriate an amount sufficient to 
cover the subsidy costs associated with all direct loan 
obligations and loan guarantee commitments made in fiscal year 
1997, as well as the administrative expenses of the loan 
programs. Amounts provided for administrative expenses may be 
transferred to and merged with the appropriation for SBA 
salaries and expenses to cover the common overhead expenses 
associated with disaster loans.
    The Committee recommendation provides $65,800,000 for the 
``Disaster Loans Program'' account for loan subsidies, and 
$78,000,000 for administrative expenses related to this 
account. These are the same funding levels as requested for 
fiscal year 1997 for the base Disaster Loans Program. At this 
time, the Committee has not provided funds classified as 
emergency spending for budgetary purposes, contingent upon 
congressional and Presidential designation as emergency 
requirements. The request for contingent emergency funds for 
fiscal year 1997 is $100,000,000.

                 Surety Bond Guarantees Revolving Fund

Appropriations, 1996....................................      $2,530,000
Budget estimate, 1997...................................       3,730,000
House allowance.........................................       3,730,000

Committee recommendation

                                                               3,730,000

    Under the Surety Bond Guarantees Program, the Small 
Business Administration guarantees a portion of the losses 
sustained by a surety company as a result of the issuance of a 
bid, payment, and/or performance bond to a small business 
concern.
    The Committee recommends an appropriation of $3,730,000 for 
additional capital for the surety bond guarantees revolving 
fund. This amount is equal to the amount requested and is 
$1,200,000 above the amount provided for fiscal year 1996.

                        Administrative Provision

    The Committee wishes to underscore that the Small Business 
Administration, as with all other agencies funded within this 
act, is subject to the reprogramming procedures with respect to 
any actions described in section 605. In addition, this 
recommendation includes an administrative provision in the bill 
language, as in last year's bill, providing the authority to 
transfer funds between the Small Business Administration's 
appropriations accounts. The language provides that no account 
may be decreased by more than 5 percent or increased by more 
than 10 percent. The language also makes the transfers subject 
to the Committee's standard reprogramming procedures.

                        State Justice Institute

Committee recommendation

                                                              10,000,000

    The Committee recommends $10,000,000 for the State Justice 
Institute [SJI] in fiscal year 1997, $3,550,000 less than the 
request, and $5,000,000 more than fiscal year 1996 funding 
levels.
    The Committee believes that funding to improve the 
efficiency of State court systems should be supported with 
State resources.
                      TITLE VI--GENERAL PROVISIONS

    The Committee recommends the following general provisions 
for the departments and agencies funded in the accompanying 
bill. Sections 601 through 607 have been included in previous 
Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related 
Agencies appropriations acts.
    Section 601 prohibits any appropriation act from being used 
for publicity or propaganda purposes not authorized by law.
    Section 602 prohibits any appropriation contained in the 
act from remaining available for obligation beyond the current 
year unless expressly so provided.
    Section 603 provides that the expenditure for any 
appropriation contained in the act for any consulting service 
through procurement contracts shall be limited to those 
contracts where such expenditures are a matter of public record 
and available for public inspection except where otherwise 
provided under existing law or under existing Executive order 
issued pursuant to existing law.
    Section 604 provides that if any provision of the act or 
the application of such provision to any person or 
circumstances shall be held invalid, the remainder of the act 
and the application of such provisions to persons or 
circumstances other than those to which it is held invalid 
shall not be affected thereby.
    Section 605 stipulates Committee policy concerning the 
reprogramming of funds. Section 605(a) prohibits the 
reprogramming of funds which: (1) create new programs; (2) 
eliminates a program, project, or activity; (3) increases funds 
or personnel by any means for any project or activity for which 
funds have been denied or restricted; (4) relocates offices or 
employees; (5) reorganizes offices, programs, or activities; 
(6) contracts out or privatizes any function or activity 
presently performed by Federal employees--unless the 
Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate are notified 
15 days in advance.
    Section 605(b) prohibits a reprogramming of funds in excess 
of $500,000, or 10 percent, whichever is less, that (1) 
augments existing programs, projects, or activities; (2) 
reduces by 10 percent funding for any existing program, 
project, or activity, or numbers of personnel by 10 percent as 
approved by Congress; or (3) results from any general savings 
due to a reduction in personnel which would result in a change 
in existing programs, activities, or projects as approved by 
Congress unless the Appropriations Committees of the House and 
Senate are notified 15 days in advance.
    Section 606 provides language regarding construction of 
NOAA ships outside of the United States.
    Section 607 continues language from the fiscal year 1996 
appropriation regarding the purchase of American-made products.
    Section 608 continues language prohibiting funds in the 
bill from being used to implement, administer, or enforce any 
guidelines of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
covering harassment based on religion similar to proposed 
guidelines published by the EEOC in October 1993.
    The Committee recommendation does not include House 
language contained in section 609 limiting the use of funds to 
expand the United States diplomatic presence in the Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam.
    Section 610 continues language from Public Law 104-134 
prohibiting the use of funds for any U.N. peacekeeping mission 
when it is made known that U.S. Armed Forces are under the 
command or operational control of a foreign national and the 
President has not submitted to Congress a recommendation that 
such involvement is in the national security interest of the 
United States.
    Section 611 continues language from Public Law 104-134 
prohibiting the use of funds to provide certain amenities and 
personal comforts in the Federal prison system.
    The recommendation does not include section 612 as passed 
by the House. The issue of fleet modernization is addressed 
under National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration accounts 
in title II of this report.
    The recommendation does not include House language 
contained in section 613 prohibiting funds for the USIA 
Television Marti Program.
    Section 614 continues language from Public Law 104-134 
providing that any closing or downsizing costs incurred by a 
Department or agency funded under this act resulting from 
funding reductions in the act shall be absorbed within the 
budgetary resources available to the Department or agency. The 
language also provides transfer of authority between 
appropriation accounts to carry out the provision subject to 
the reprogramming procedures outlined in section 605 of this 
act.
    Section 615 repeats House-passed language limiting the 
availability of pornography to Federal prisoners.
    The Committee recommendation does not include sections 616 
through 619 of the House bill.
    Section 620 eliminates current reprogramming requirements 
which are redundant with section 605 described above.
    Section 621 provides language prohibiting any agency of the 
Government from using appropriated funds to deny an application 
for a permit to import United States origin curios or relics, 
firearms, parts, or ammunition. In 1988, Congress made 
provision for the importation of certain United States origin 
ammunition, curio or relic firearms, and parts into the United 
States at 22 U.S.C. 2778 (b)(1)(B).
    Section 622 provides language to increase flexibility 
within the Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program under the Maritime 
Administration to allow loan guarantees relating to 
reactivation of shipyards.
                         TITLE VII--RESCISSIONS

                         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

                         General Administration

                          working capital fund

                              (rescission)

    The Committee recommends a rescission of $30,000,000 from 
the unobligated balances available in the Department's working 
capital fund [WCF] on October 15, 1996. As of July 25, 1996, 
Department officials estimated that in excess of $40,000,000 of 
unobligated balances will be deposited into the WCF in early 
October 1996. In addition to the aforementioned rescission, the 
Committee has directed that in fiscal year 1997 at least 
$10,000,000 of the unobligated balances in the WCF should be 
made available to the new telecommunications carrier compliance 
fund. In addition, no less than $3,500,000 of the unobligated 
balances in the WCF should be made available to support the 
FIREBIRD automation project at the Drug Enforcement 
Administration.

                 Immigration and Naturalization Service

                       immigration emergency fund

                              (rescission)

    The Committee recommends a rescission of $34,779,000 from 
the unobligated balances available in the INS immigration 
emergency fund. According to information provided to the 
Committee by the Department of Justice on June 25, 1996, the 
Department projected $42,500,000 in end-of-year carryover 
balances in this account. The recommendation would reduce the 
balances and allow the Attorney General to retain a $7,721,000 
reserve for legitimate immigration emergencies. The Committee 
notes that the Attorney General has not expended resources from 
this account in either of the last 2 years.
  COMPLIANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 7, RULE XVI OF THE STANDING RULES OF THE
