                                FOREWORD

                              ----------                              

                          House of Representatives,
                      Committee on International Relations,
                                   Washington, DC, January 2, 1997.
    Under rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives 
and section 136 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, 
the Committee on International Relations is authorized to 
exercise continuous surveillance of the execution by the 
executive branch of laws within the committee's jurisdiction. 
The review of ``oversight'' activities of the Committee on 
International Relations was augmented by the adoption of 
section 118 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 
(Public Law 91-150), as amended by Public Law 92-136. This 
provision requires standing committees of the House and the 
Senate after January 1, 1973, to make reports to their 
respective Houses on their activities in reviewing and studying 
the ``application, administration, and execution of those laws 
or parts of laws, the subject of which is within the 
jurisdiction of that committee.
    House committees are required to file such reports ``not 
later than January 2 of each odd-numbered year.'' It is in 
fulfillment of the obligation of the Committee on International 
Relations to account to the House for its legislative review 
activities during the 104th Congress that this report has been 
prepared and submitted.
    The report was prepared by Laura L. Rush, Legislative 
Coordinator for the Committee.

Hon. Robin H. Carle,
Clerk of the House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Ms. Carle: I enclose herewith a report for the 104th 
Congress of the Legislative Review Activities of the Committee 
on International Relations in accordance with section 136 of

amended by Public Law 92-136.

 Mr. Gilman, from the Committee on International Relations, submitted 
                             the following

                              R E P O R T

        I. INTRODUCTION: OVERSIGHT IN THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS FIELD

                 A. Authorities for Legislative Review

    The responsibilities and potentialities of legislative 
review are reflected in the multiple authorities which are 
available to the Committee on International Relations. The most 
prominent is section 118 of the Legislative Reorganization Act 
of 1970 (Public Law 91-510):

 Legislative Review by Standing Committees of the Senate and House of 
                            Representatives

    (a) Scope of assistance.
    In order to assist the Congress in--
          (1) Its analysis, appraisal, and evaluation of the 
        application, administration, and execution of the laws 
        enacted by the Congress, and
          (2) Its formulation, consideration, and enactment of 
        such modifications of or changes in those laws, and of 
        such additional legislation, as may be necessary or 
        appropriate, each standing committee of the Senate and 
        the House of Representatives shall review and study, on 
        a continuing basis, the application, administration, 
        and execution of those laws, or parts of laws, the 
        subject matter of which is within the jurisdiction of 
        that committee. Such committees may carry out the 
        required analysis, appraisals, and evaluation 
        themselves, or by contract, or may require a Government 
        agency to do so and furnish a report thereon to the 
        Congress. Such committees may rely on such techniques 
        as pilot testing, analysis of costs in comparison with 
        benefits, or provision for evaluation after a defined 
        period of time.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Section 701 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344) amended the original mandate and 
authority of the 1970 act by adding the last two sentences regarding 
program review and evaluation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A second type of authority fostering legislative review is 
the special oversight granted by the House Committee Reform 
Amendments of 1974 (H. Res. 988, approved Oct. 8, 1974). 
Special oversight, which is intended to enable committees to 
conduct comprehensive oversight of matters directly bearing 
upon their specified responsibilities even if those matters 
fall within the jurisdiction of other standing committees, 
permits an expansion of the legislative review jurisdiction of 
a committee.
    The Committee on International Relations currently has 
special oversight jurisdiction in four areas under clause 3(d) 
of House Rule X.
          3. (d) The Committee on International Relations shall 
        have the function of reviewing and studying, on a 
        continuing basis, all laws, programs, and Government 
        activities dealing with or involving customs 
        administration, intelligence activities relating to 
        foreign policy, international financial and monetary 
        organizations, and international fishing agreements.
    Frequently reporting requirements in legislation obligate 
various agencies, directly or through the President, to submit 
reports of certain activities to the Committee on International 
Relations to the Speaker of the House, who then transmits them 
to the committee. The House Committee on International 
Relations is the recipient of one of the largest quantities of 
required reports from the executive branch.
    In addition to the authorities noted above, the 
congressional budget process provides the committee with 
another important tool for oversight. Pursuant to section 
301(c) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974, 
each standing committee of the House is required to submit to 
the Committee on the budget, no later than March 15 of each 
year, a report containing its views and estimates on the 
President's proposed budget for the coming fiscal year. This 
requirement affords the committee and its subcommittees the 
opportunity to review those items in the President's budget 
which fall under the committee's jurisdiction, and to establish 
possible guidelines for subsequent action on authorizing 
legislation.
    A final authority which can have an impressive oversight 
impact is implicit in the authorization process. Regular and 
frequent reauthorization of programs or agency operations by 
committees presents the opportunity to investigate 
administrative personnel hiring and promotion practices, agency 
organization, employee development and benefit programs, policy 
guidance, and administrative rules and regulations regarding 
the implementation and execution of policy, among other items. 
The authorization process also permits program evaluation, an 
important oversight technique.
    The legislative review activities of the Committee on 
International Relations are sanctioned by various and extensive 
authorities--the basic mandate of the 1970 Legislative 
Reorganization Act, the broadened jurisdiction and special 
oversight provided by the House Committee Reform Amendments of 
1974, statutory reporting requirements, and the authorization 
process.

 B. Oversight Developments in the Committee on International Relations

    During the 95th Congress, the committee received 
jurisdictional authority over export controls involving 
nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware, 
and international commodity agreements involving cooperation in 
the export of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware. This new 
jurisdictional authority was provided for by House Resolution 
5, which passed the House on January 4, 1977.
    In the 96th Congress, the committee's jurisdiction was not 
enlarged. However, the committee in its organization for the 
96th Congress reduced the number of subcommittees from nine to 
eight. Deleted was the Subcommittee on International 
Development whose jurisdiction included: (1) Dealing with the 
Agency for International Development and other U.S. agencies' 
operations affecting development; (2) administration of foreign 
assistance; (3) oversight of multilateral assistance programs; 
(4) population and food programs; and (5) legislation and 
oversight with respect to the Peace Corps, which was subsumed 
by the full committee. The subcommittees for the 96th Congress, 
representing a mix of geographical and functional 
responsibilities, were as follows:
          Subcommittee on International Security and Scientific 
        Affairs;
          Subcommittee on International Operations;
          Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East;
          Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and 
        Trade;
          Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs;
          Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs;
          Subcommittee on Africa; and
          Subcommittee on International Organizations.
    In the 97th Congress, the subcommittees remained the same 
with the exception of the Subcommittee on International 
Organizations, whose name was changed to the Subcommittee on 
Human Rights and International Organizations, in order to 
delineate clearly its jurisdiction over the subject of human 
rights.
    In the 98th Congress, the subcommittees remained the same, 
however, the name of the Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs 
was changed to the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. 
In addition, a special task force was created under the aegis 
of the full committee, the Task Force on International 
Narcotics Control. The purpose of this task force was to 
provide oversight of narcotics-related developments and 
programs over which the committee has jurisdiction pursuant to 
rule X of the Rules of the House, which included the following:
    Narcotics control programs conducted by the Department of 
State; Narcotics-related projects carried out by the Agency for 
International Development (AID); Overseas activities of the 
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Department of Defense; and 
the U.S. Customs Service; Narcotics control programs carried 
out by international organizations; Intelligence issues related 
to narcotics trafficking and control; Prisoner exchange 
programs and their impact on U.S. narcotics control efforts; 
Narcotics interdiction programs and agreement; Narcotics-
related efforts by the U.S. Information Agency; and 
Relationship between international banking/financial 
transactions and narcotics trafficking.
    Because of the importance of narcotics control issues, the 
Task Force was reconstituted every six months through the 102nd 
Congress.
    Subcommittee structure remained the same for the 99th 
Congress; however, the name of the Subcommittee on 
International Security and Scientific Affairs was changed to 
the Subcommittee on Arms Control, International Security and 
Science. This change was made to reflect the committee's and 
subcommittee's concern over the important issues of arms 
control. The jurisdiction of the subcommittee was redefined in 
the rules of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to read, ``To 
deal with * * * all aspects of arms control and disarmament 
with particular emphasis on the investigation and evaluation of 
arms control and disarmament proposals and concepts; * * *''.
    Under the Rules of the House, the Committee on 
International Relations has jurisdiction over issues involving 
international terrorism pursuant to rule X of the Rules of the 
House, paragraphs (I)(1), (I)(4-10), and (I)(12-16). For the 
99th Congress, two subcommittee jurisdictional changes were 
made to reflect the committee's concern with international 
terrorism. The Subcommittee on Arms Control, International 
Security and Science was given jurisdiction over ``* * * 
international terrorism with special focus on the U.S. 
Government's policies and programs for combating international 
terrorist movements and actions; * * *''. The Subcommittee on 
International Operations jurisdictional responsibility was 
redefined to include ``* * * international terrorism with 
special emphasis on policies and programs relating to the 
enhancement for embassy security and the protection of U.S. 
personnel and institutions abroad; * * *''.
    In addition, two subcommittees had language added to their 
respective definitions providing responsibility for oversight 
of international communication and information policy. Lastly, 
the Subcommittee on Human Rights and International 
Organizations was given the responsibility for international 
law.
    No changes were made in subcommittee structure or 
jurisdiction for the 100th, 101st, or 102nd Congresses.
    In the 103rd Congress, the Committee was required by the 
Rules of the Democratic Caucus to reduce the number of 
subcommittees from eight to six. However, due to concern about 
retaining a subcommittee with exclusive focus on Africa, the 
Committee received a waiver of Rule 35(B) of the Democratic 
Caucus and retained seven subcommittees. The Subcommittee on 
Arms Control, International Security, and Science, and the 
Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations 
were merged to create the Subcommittee on International 
Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights. The 
jurisdiction of that subcommittee was essentially a merger of 
the jurisdictions of the two subcommittees. However, specific 
reference to ``* * * law enforcement issues to  include  
terrorism  and  narcotics  control  programs  and activities * 
* *'' was added to the jurisdiction of the subcommittee, 
thereby consolidating all jurisdiction over narcotics and 
terrorism in one subcommittee. The Committee also added 
specific reference to environmental issues to the jurisdiction 
of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade 
and changed the name of the subcommittee to the Subcommittee on 
Economic Policy, Trade, and Environment to reflect that 
addition. In addition, jurisdiction over the operating expenses 
of the Agency for International Development and the Arms 
Control and Disarmament Agency was added to the Subcommittee on 
International Operations. Finally, the Committee made minor 
conforming changes to the names of two of its regional 
subcommittees.
    In the 104th Congress, pursuant to H. Res. 6, passed 
January 4, 1995, the name of the Committee was changed from 
``Foreign Affairs'' to ``International Relations''. In 
addition, the number of subcommittees was decreased from seven 
to five. The Subcommittee on International Security, 
International Organizations, and Human Rights, and the 
Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East were dissolved. The 
Europe and Middle East Subcommittee jurisdiction was reabsorbed 
by the full Committee. The Subcommittee on Economic Policy, 
Trade, and Environment dropped ``environment'' from its title, 
returning its name to the ``Subcommittee on International 
Economic Policy and Trade.'' The Subcommittee on International 
Security, International Organizations, and Human Rights and the 
Subcommittee on International Operations were combined, with a 
name change to ``Subcommittee on International Operations and 
Human Rights''.

                  C. Oversight Activities and Criteria

    The oversight activities of the Committee on International 
Relations include a variety of instruments and mechanisms--full 
committee and subcommittee hearings, members'' and staff study 
missions abroad, special Congressional Research Service 
studies, and General Accounting Office assistance and reports 
in the field of international relations.
    Committee and subcommittee hearings may be conducted for 
numerous purposes and may serve more than one function, i.e., 
oversight, legislation, public education simultaneously. Thus, 
oversight may exist even when the hearing is not explicitly 
intended for that purpose. The criteria for determining whether 
a hearing performs the oversight function were identified by 
the House Select Committee on Committees in 1973 and are as 
follows: \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ U.S. Congress, House. Select Committee on Committees. Committee 
Reform Amendments of 1974. Report, 93rd Congress, 2d session, March 21, 
1974 (H.Rept.No. 93-916, Part II).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    (1) To review and control unacceptable forms of 
bureaucratic behavior;
    (2) To insure that bureaucracy implements the policy 
objectives of the Congress;
    (3) To analyze national and international problems 
requiring Federal action; and
    (4) To determine the effectiveness of legislative programs 
and policies.
    These same purposes help to define other committee activity 
which relates to its legislative review function. It should be 
noted that not all such activity can be included in this 
report. Oversight may occur informally, not only through the 
formal processes and mechanisms noted above. Informal 
discussions between committee members and executive branch 
officials may constitute oversight in certain instances as may 
staff examination of agency activity and behavior and staff 
consultation with agency personnel apart from the normal 
hearing process.
    In summary, the legislative review activities of the House 
Committee on International Relations for the 104th Congress 
rely on extensive authorities embodied in the Legislative 
Reorganization Act of 1970 and reinforced through the 
authorization process, subsequent legislation, and reporting 
requirements.

 D. Oversight Activities of the Committee on International Relations--
                             104th Congress

    The following section is set out in compliance with Clause 
(1)(d)(3) of Rule XI.
    Almost all of the Committee's day-to-day activities, 
including hearings and informal meetings, involve oversight of 
the Administration or afford the Committee the opportunity to 
learn the impact of United States foreign policy.
    The Committee's Oversight Plan is set out below in full. 
Although the Committee did not conduct every hearing planned, 
most oversight issues were accomplished to some degree or 
addressed in some way, such as through briefings or staff work.
(Adopted by the Committee, February 14, 1995; numbering scheme 
adopted April, 1995).

          Committee on International Relations Oversight Plan

    Rule X, clause 2 (d) of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires that each standing Committee adopt an 
oversight plan for the two-year period of the Congress and to 
submit the plan to the Committees on Government Reform and 
Oversight and House Oversight not later than February 15 of the 
first session of the Congress.
    This is the oversight plan of the Committee on 
International Relations for the 104th Congress. It includes the 
areas in which the Committee intended to conduct oversight 
during this Congress. As the Committee's priorities change, the 
oversight work of the Committee may change. The fact that an 
issue is listed here does not mean that the Committee 
necessarily held a formal meeting devoted solely to that issue, 
but means that the Committee hoped to cover the issue during

foreign affairs and other matters within its oversight 
jurisdiction.

    K-3. Oversight of U.S. policy toward Rwanda & Burundi. Will 
Burundi also explode in Hutu-Tutsi violence? Is the Tutsi 
government in Rwanda reaching out to Hutus? Should donor 
nations withdraw support from refugee camps where Hutu 
extremists are in power? (Winter/Spring, 1995)
    K-4. U.S. efforts to improve democracy in Africa. The 
committee will review during U.S. initiatives undertaken to 
provide technical assistance to African nations during their 
periods of transition towards democracy. (Spring, 1995)
    K-5. U.S. trade, private investment, and economic 
development in Africa. The Committee will attempt to determine 
whether current policy aimed at increasing U.S. access to 
Africa's vital exports, and at increasing U.S. exports, is 
effective, to include a review of the activities of OPIC, Exim 
Bank, and the Commerce Department. Also, the Committee will 
examine U.S. efforts to encourage inter-African trade; African 
trade with the rest of the world is ten times higher than trade 
within Africa. (Spring, 1995)
    K-6. Economic conditions and development in Africa. It has 
been suggested that by using bilateral levels of assistance and 
support for the World Bank and debt reduction programs as 
leverage, the U.S. can help African countries liberalize their 
economies. The committee will review U.S. efforts to promote 
the growth of market economies in Africa. (Spring, 1995)
    K-7. Oversight over the AID activities such as the 
Development Fund for Africa, and of agencies such as the Africa 
Development Foundation. It has been suggested that there is 
duplication among these agencies and USAID, and that some of 
the programs are outdated or otherwise ineffective. Do they 
constrain more creative, trade-based development? As to the 
Africa Development Foundation: are its overhead costs too high? 
What results can be shown from micro-enterprise efforts? Is it 
adequately funded? Should it remain an independent corporation? 
(Fall, 1995)
    K-8. U.S. Foreign Assistance to Africa. The committee will 
review thoroughly all foreign aid requests for Africa in all 
categories of assistance in the light of current policy and 
performance. (Fall, 1995)
    K-9. U.S. peacekeeping and its military presence in Africa. 
Is U.S. involvement in internal African conflicts in the 
national interest? Special attention will be paid to U.S. 
assistance for the final U.N. pullout from Somalia and to the 
peace process and prospects for peacekeeping in Angola. (Fall, 
1995)
    K-10. U.S. policy toward Zaire and Nigeria. How does the 
U.S. approach deal with regimes that have apparently failed to 
perform the most basic governmental obligations? (Fall, 1995/
Winter, 1996)
    K-11. Review of U.S. policy toward French relations with 
Francophone Africa. France's policies in Africa appear to have 
had negative effects on liberalization and democratization. 
What effect have these policies had on the people of Africa? 
How can the U.S. and other nations best counter and overcome 
them? (Fall, 1995/Winter, 1996)
    K-12. Review of U.S. analytical framework for its approach 
to Africa. Should the United States stop looking at Africa as a 
singularity and begin to think in terms of sub-regions? (Fall, 
1995/Winter, 1996)
    K-13. U.S. Policy towards South Africa.
    K-14. HIV and other health issues. The Committee will 
review U.S. programs and projects in Africa to combat HIV and 
other health-related problems. (Spring, 1996)
    K-15. African Ecological problems. The Committee will hold 
hearings to gain further insight on U.S. efforts to resolve 
these problems. (Spring, 1996)
    K-16. Refugee issues: causes and responses. The United 
States government, working in conjunction with United Nations 
relief agencies and other international relief organizations, 
is the leading provider of assistance in response to refugee 
emergencies worldwide. The Committee will assess the factors 
causing these refugee crises; how the U.S. and the 
international community is responding to these situations; 
address the notion of prevention; and how to improve upon the 
measures already in place. (Spring, 1996)

                        INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

State Department

    L-1. Organization of the Department of State. The Committee 
will examine changes in the organization of the Department, 
with particular reference to amendments made in the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995. Review 
progress on the Department's management initiatives and 
reengineering proposals, including a review of resource 
allocations overseas and in Washington based on agency 
priorities and necessary cost savings; personnel reforms in 
both the civil and foreign services and downsizing of overseas 
and Washington based bureaucracy; review use of allowances 
overseas and performance pay awards and possible adjustments; 
effectiveness/morale of civil service staff, including support 
staff. Proper placement of officials responsible for Canada and 
the FSU within the State bureaucracy. (Winter-Spring, 1995)
    L-2. Diplomatic and consular programs. The Committee will 
examine the impact of the end of the Cold War on United States 
diplomatic needs; role of diplomatic posts in monitoring 
international drug trafficking; impact of new technology on 
diplomatic and consular programs; and the protection of foreign 
missions and officials in the United States. (Spring-Summer, 
1995)
    L-3. Oversight of Foreign Buildings activities. This is one 
of the largest accounts at the State Department. The Committee 
will oversee the activities of the Foreign Buildings Office, 
which is responsible for the several new posts opened in the 
former Soviet Union, for the disposition of certain surplus 
property abroad, and for security upgrades and maintenance. 
(Summer/Fall, 1995)
    L-4. Review of overseas security. The Department's new 
``risk management'' criteria permits savings by allowing 
managers to set security standards on a case by case basis. How 
is this working: is safety being compromised?
    L-5. Is State doing enough planning/forward thinking? 
(Summer/Fall, 1996)
    L-6. Oversight of Inspectors General of foreign affairs 
agencies. Are they working effectively? Are they being listened 
to? (Summer/Fall, 1995)
    L-7. Review of consular activities. The Consular Affairs 
bureau is responsible for visas, passports and American Citizen 
services abroad; it is the front line for border security. 
Oversight issues include the status of resources for security 
and services to Americans overseas. Do consular officers in the 
field receive any feedback about whether their decisions to 
admit/deny visas are valid (i.e., does INS report to individual 
posts/officers on overstays, etc.)? (Fall, 1995)
    L-8. International Organizations. The Committee will review 
the extent, costs, and benefits of United States participation 
in the United Nations and its affiliated organizations (e.g. 
UNICEF, WHO, UNPF), including issues of U.N. management 
reforms. (Summer, 1996)
    L-9. Migration and refugee assistance. This Committee will 
examine the programs and administrative expenses of the bureau 
charged with carrying out the purposes of the Migration and 
Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. (Fall, 1995)

United States Information Agency

    L-10. Broadcasting. All international broadcasting has been 
consolidated at USIA under a new Board for International 
Broadcasting. The transition will take some time and has 
required considerable adjustments, and restructuring, within 
USIA. (Fall, 1996)
    L-11. Oversight of Au Pair regulations. New regulations 
will be issued February 1995, and implementation of these 
should be reviewed, along with assessing which agency (if any) 
should administer the program.
    L-12. Oversight of International Exchanges. USIA has 
statutory responsibility to coordinate international exchanges 
operated government-wide. Recent studies have identified 
significant overlap and duplication in exchange programs. A 
review of options to consolidate these exchanges to improve 
efficiency of programs may yield substantial budget savings 
(estimates $200-250 million).
    L-13. Other USIA programs. The Committee will examine such 
other USIA programs as its work on international conferences 
and commissions. (Fall, 1996)

Other

    L-14. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Consolidation.

Development called for significant new spending on population 
programs, but spending is already high. Are more resources the 
answer? Problems with/effectiveness of population efforts. 
(Summer, 1995)
    N-2. Child survival. The Committee will examine the current 
state of infant mortality around the world, and will review 
United States participation in programs that aim to alleviate 
it, such as UNICEF. (Fall, 1995)

                              HUMAN RIGHTS

    O-1. Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Committee 
will examine the current state of observance of the 
Declaration, including issues relating to the forced 
repatriation of refugees to countries where they are in 
significant danger of becoming victims of violations of their 
human rights. (Spring, 1995)
    O-2. The Convention Against Torture And Other Cruel, 
Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Committee

infractions of the right of religious liberty around the world, 
and the United States response to these abuses. (Fall, 1995)
    O-4. Anti-semitism. There are suggestions that varieties of 
anti-Semitism unseen since before World War II are emerging at 
various points in the world. The committee will examine this 
problem and the United States response to it. (Fall, 1995)
    O-5. Sexual exploitation of women and children. The 
Committee will examine the problems of large-scale 
prostitution, including child prostitution, in various parts of 
the world, and the United States response. (Fall, 1995)
    O-6. Former Yugoslavia. The Committee will explore charges 
regarding human rights abuses arising out of the ongoing war in 
this region. (Spring, 1996)
    O-7. Chechnya. The Committee will examine the human rights 
implications of the conduct of the Russian military in this 
region. (Spring, 1996)
    O-8. Slavery. The Committee will examine Administration 
efforts to eradicate slavery throughout the world, with 
particular attention to the situation in Mauritania and the 
Sudan.
    Additional matters taken up included reports of political 
murders in Haiti, and matters related to Bosnia.
    Substantially all of the Committee's hearings (see section 
IV), involved oversight, with the exception of hearings held by 
the full Committee and Subcommittees on specific legislation.
    The results of the Committee's oversight have included the 
public attention to matters raised as a result of the 
Committee's hearings and other activities; the adoption of 
legislation such as the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity 
(LIBERTAD) Act and the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, and 
legislation reforming certain foreign assistance and ship 
transfer authorities (Pub. L. 104-164). In addition, the 
oversight activities of the Committee helped prepare for 
Committee and full House action on legislation such as H.R. 7 
and H.R. 1561, described elsewhere, which were not enacted into 
law.
    The Committee believes that its attention to oversight has 
helped provide Congress and the American public with an 
opportunity to better evaluate the foreign policy developed by 
the Administration and has helped provide the Administration 
with feedback on these important matters from the Members of 
Congress and the public.

             II. GENERAL REVIEW ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE

                      A. Executive Branch Reports

    Reporting requirements in legislation and the reports 
submitted in response to them constitute one of the oldest 
information systems used by Congress. On every subject with 
which Congress deals, required reports offer a way to oversee 
and review the implementation of legislation by the executive 
branch.
    In the foreign policy field, it is particularly important 
to insure that reporting requirements and the resultant reports 
submitted by the executive branch are an efficient mechanism 
for supplying Congress with information. Information on 
domestic problems is often easier to obtain from sources 
outside the executive branch than information on problems from 
abroad. Moreover, the executive branch has sometimes attempted 
to shield its activities in the foreign policy field from 
public view and treat it as its exclusive domain. The lack of 
information on foreign policy problems and executive branch 
activities has been one of the major reasons it has been more 
difficult for Congress to play its legitimate role in the 
making of foreign policy, although the Constitution expressly 
shares such powers between Congress and the President.
    For the Committee on International Relations, the 
improvement of the system of required reports offers another 
step toward a better supply of information that Congress needs 
to make foreign policy decisions. Through the careful placing 
of reporting requirements in legislation, Congress can improve 
its capacity for an effective foreign policy role.

                         B. Reference Documents

    Periodically the Committee on International Relations 
compiles, prints, and distributes official documents which are 
useful to the membership in exercising the oversight function 
as well as other responsibilities. The following is a listing 
of those compilations for the 104th Congress:
    1. Legislation on Foreign Relations.--This 5 volume set is 
prepared under the direction of the staff of the House 
Committee on International Relations and the Senate Committee 
on Foreign Relations with the assistance of the Foreign Affairs 
and National Defense Division of the Congressional Research 
Service of the Library of Congress. This collection of laws and 
related materials contains texts referred to by the Committee 
on International Relations, and the Foreign Relations 
Committee, amended to date, and annotated to show pertinent 
history or cross references. The volumes include all laws 
concerning foreign relations, codified and in force, treaties 
in force, as well as executive agreements and orders, State 
Department regulations and State Department delegations of 
authorities as of October 31, 1996.
    2. Legislative Calendar.--This compendium of committee 
legislative information is published annually. Each volume 
includes a current listing and status of all committee 
legislation; committee publications and reports; executive 
communications and messages from the President referred to the 
committee; House floor amendments in committee legislation; and 
a legislative progress chart.

 C. Study Missions and Participation in International Conferences and 
                                 Events

    The committee has kept itself informed of the latest 
developments in foreign affairs. Conferences with high 
government officials have been augmented by special study 
missions to various parts of the world to obtain firsthand 
knowledge of the problems of foreign countries and the 
administration of U.S. programs and operations falling within 
the purview of the committee.

 Separate views of the Ranking Democratic Member, The Honorable Lee H. 
                                Hamilton

    I write separately because I reach a different conclusion 
regarding the Committee's legislative activities in the 104th 
Congress. I am particularly concerned with the section of this 
report devoted to legislation addressed by the Committee and 
the section that describes the Committee's oversight work.
    The Committee report, in describing bills that were signed 
into law, includes major bills that were never considered by 
the Committee such as the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act, the 
Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1996, and the food aid 
title of the Agricultural Market Transition Act. These bills 
bypassed the Committee entirely, either going directly to 
debate on the floor of the House, or being added to 
appropriations measures. In these cases, the House leadership 
circumvented the Committee, or allowed others to circumvent the 
Committee's jurisdiction.
    In its narratives on bills passed by the House and/or the 
Senate, the Committee report leaves out critical aspects of the 
descriptions of these bills and the process under which they 
were considered. The Committee devoted the great majority of 
its legislative time during the 104th Congress to two measures: 
H.R. 1561, the American Overseas Interests Act, and H.R. 7, the 
National Security Revitalization Act. Both measures were 
approved both in the Committee and by the House on virtually 
straight party-line votes. In the drafting of both bills, the 
minority was given little opportunity to work together with the 
majority to find common ground. The majority had the votes to 
move these bills through the Committee and through the House. 
Both H.R. 7 and H.R. 1561, however, provide prime examples that 
a divisive partisan process will not result in the enactment of 
legislation.
    I also must comment on the Committee report's description 
of the Committee's oversight activities, which I find 
misleading. The report details the plans submitted by the 
Committee at the beginning of the 104th Congress and states 
that most [planned oversight items] were accomplished to some 
degree.'' In reviewing the list, it is my impression that fewer 
than half of the items listed have been satisfactorily 
addressed, at the Member or staff level. I am especially 
concerned about the inadequate oversight of U.S. policy in 
Europe and the Middle East, and the inability of the Committee 
to hold regular oversight hearings with the appropriate 
Assistant Secretaries of State for those regions.
    I believe the Committee needs to adopt a more constructive 
approach to its review and criticism of U.S. foreign policy. 
Criticism is often warranted, but the Committee should adopt a 
legislative and oversight agenda for the 105th Congress 
designed to improve the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, rather 
than make it more difficult. I would hope that both majority 
and minority have learned from the last two years, and that we 
will approach our legislative and oversight tasks with a clear 
interest in the success of policy rather than its failure. The 
interests of the United States will be served best by efforts 
to forge a bipartisan consensus on the difficult foreign policy 
issues before the 105th Congress.

                                           Lee H. Hamilton,
                                         Ranking Democratic Member.

                              ----------                              


                     COMMITTEE ORIGINS AND HISTORY

    The Committee on Foreign Affairs/International Relations 
traces its origins to November 29, 1775. It was on that date 
that the Continental Congress by resolution created a committee 
``for the sole purposes of corresponding with our friends in 
Great Britain, Ireland, and other parts of the world.'' The 
members chosen for this committee were Benjamin Franklin--who 
served as chairman and guiding spirit--Benjamin Harrison, 
Thomas Johnson, Jr., John Dickinson, and John Jay. Known at 
first as the Committee of Correspondence, the committee itself 
soon changed its name to the Committee of Secret 
Correspondence.
    That committee was the first institution created to 
represent the United States in the foreign affairs field. The 
Committee on Foreign Affairs (as well as the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee) is a lineal descendant of the Committee of 
Correspondence.
    Franklin's committee quickly entered into communication 
with various persons in Europe for the purpose of ascertaining 
sentiment there toward the Colonies and obtaining any other 
information which might be useful in the struggle with England. 
It even designated its own secret agents abroad.
    By the spring of 1777, the specialized nature of the 
committee's work had been recognized and its title changed to 
``Committee for Foreign Affairs.'' Special problems in foreign 
relations, however, were sometimes dealt with by select or 
temporary committees appointed for the purpose.
    After the Congress of the United States was organized under 
the Constitution, select committees to deal with foreign 
affairs were appointed. In 1807, during the Jefferson 
Presidency, a House committee was established in response to 
predatory actions by both the French and British against 
American commercial shipping. Following the seizure and search 
of the U.S. frigate Chesapeake 10 miles off the Virginia coast 
by a British ship, the House appointed a special Foreign 
Relations Committee which was also known as the Aggression 
Committee. That committee had an active role in foreign policy 
considerations through the War of 1812 and in 1822, renamed the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs, was designated a standing 
committee of the House with a membership of seven. The 150th 
anniversary of that event was celebrated by the committee in 
1972.
    Because the House is the organ of National Government 
closest to the citizenry, the Committee on Foreign Affairs may 
truly be said to have been the voice of the American people on 
issues of international significance for more than a century 
and a half. Although this important role has remained the same, 
the name of the committee was changed on March 19, 1975, by a 
resolution (House Resolution 163) sponsored by 22 members of 
the committee to the Committee on International Relations. The 
change resulted from the extensive discussions by the members 
that were undertaken in relation to the reorganization of the 
subcommittee structure of the committee. It was the consensus 
that the change in the name of the full committee would more 
accurately reflect the organization of the committee as it had 
been agreed upon by its own members at that time. Subsequently, 
at the beginning of the 96th Congress, the committee again 
reorganized its subcommittee structure and agreed to the 
introduction of House Resolution 89, sponsored by 30 Members, 
to return to the committee's original name ``The Committee on 
Foreign Affairs.'' The resolution was agreed to on February 5, 
1979.
    Throughout its history, the committee has been composed of 
some of America's most able legislators and statesmen. Two 
American Presidents have served on it: James K. Polk, from 1827 
to 1831, and John Quincy Adams, who became chairman in 1842 
after he returned to the House following his term as the Chief 
Executive.
    Many former chairmen of the committee have written their 
names into the history books. Among them was Edward Everett of 
Massachusetts, chairman in the 20th Congress, who also served 
as Secretary of State, was a Whig Vice Presidential candidate 
in 1860, and is remembered as one of America's greatest 
orators. Francis W. Pickens, who chaired the committee from 
1839 to 1841, later became Governor of South Carolina and 
authorized the firing on Fort Sumter which precipitated the 
Civil War.
    Serving as chairman in the aftermath of World War I, 
Stephen G. Porter of Pennsylvania came to be one of the most 
influential figures in the determination of American foreign 
policy in the early 1920's. In more recent times, Chairman Sol 
Bloom of New York and James P. Richards of South Carolina have 
been recognized for their contributions to America's leadership 
in the immediate post- World War II period. The longest tenure 
as chairman in the history of the committee was that of Hon. 
Thomas E. Morgan of Pennsylvania who served in that position 
from 1959 until the end of the 94th Congress.
    Other former members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs--
men like Tom Connally of Texas, Champ Clark of Iowa, and J. 
William Fulbright of Arkansas, Mike Mansfield of Montana, and 
Jacob Javits of New York, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, and 
Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut--went to the U.S. Senate where 
they established reputations for their work on international 
affairs legislation.
    Moreover, committee experience has provided a beginning for 
numerous men who have gone on to distinguish themselves in the 
diplomatic service of the country. Among them was Perry 
Belmont, chairman in the 49th and 50th Congresses, who was U.S. 
Minister of Spain in 1888-89 and a noted author of work on 
international policies. His successor as chairman in the 51st 
Congress was Robert R. Hitt of Ohio who was chief of the U.S. 
Delegation in Paris from 1874 to 1881 and subsequently was 
appointed Assistant Secretary of State. Christian A. Herter, 
who served as Secretary of State during the Eisenhower 
administration, was a committee member in the 82d Congress. 
More recent examples are: Chester Bowles, former Under 
Secretary of State; James W. Wadsworth, former U.S. 
Representative of the United Nations; F. Bradford Morse, United 
Nations Development Programs; E. Ross Adair, former Ambassador 
to Ethiopia; William S. Mailliard, former Ambassador to the 
Organization of America States; and J. Danforth Quayle, former 
Vice President of the United States.

\3\ Hon. John Kee died on May 8, 1951. Hon. James P. Richards became    
  chairman for remainder of 82nd Congress.                              
Note--The data is taken from collections of congressional directories in
  the Library of Congress, Department of State, Supreme Court and the   
  National Archives. The following volumes are missing from all         
  collections: 34th Congress 3d session, 37th Congress 1st and 3rd      
  session, 40th Congress 1st session, 55th Congress 1st session, 58th   
  Congress 1st session, 75th Congress 2nd session, and 76th Congress 2nd
  session.                                                              
Party designations are taken from biographical dictionary of the        
  American Congress, and are unavoidably subject to error in the early  
  period, due to the vagueness of party lines and frequent shifting of  
  men from one party to another on critical issues. In instances where  
  the Biographical Directory incorrectly refers to Democratic           
  Republicans as Democrats the designation has been changed.
