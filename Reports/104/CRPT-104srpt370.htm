   Mr. Hatfield, from the Committee on Appropriations, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

    The Committee on Appropriations submits the following 
report revising the 602(b) allocations to subcommittees set 
forth in Senate Report 104-285 (June 20, 1996) and revised in 
Senate Report 104-347 (August 1, 1996).
    Section 302(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as 
amended, provides that at any time after a committee reports 
its allocations such committee may report to its House an 
alteration of such allocations. This report is submitted 
pursuant to this section.
    On September 16, 1996, the Committee on the Budget filed a 
revised 602(a) allocation for the Committee reflecting an 
increase of $175,000,000 in budget authority and $310,000,000 
in outlays (Congressional Record, pp. S10614-10615). These 
amounts were provided under the provisions of section 103(c) of 
Public Law 104-124 and section 211(d)(5) of Public Law 104-193 
which mandate an increase to the Committee's 602(a) allocation 
when certain conditions relating to funding of continuing 
disability reviews are met.
    The Committee notes that, under the terms of section 304 of 
the budget resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 178, the 
chairman of the Committee on the Budget may increase the 602(a) 
allocation of the Committee on Appropriations if certain 
conditions relating to funding of the superfund program are 
met.
    In addition, under the terms of section 307 of the budget 
resolution, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget may 
increase the 602(a) allocation of the Committee on 
Appropriations if certain conditions relating to a continuing 
resolution are met.
