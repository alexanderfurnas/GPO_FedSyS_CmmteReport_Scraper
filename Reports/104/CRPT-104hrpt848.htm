                     Subtitle A--General Provisions

SEC. 221. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In many respects the Administration is a unique 
        agency, being one of the few non-defense government 
        agencies that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the 
        year, while continuing to rely on outdated technology 
        to carry out its responsibilities for a state-of-the-
        art industry.
            (2) Until January 1, 1996, users of the air 
        transportation system paid 70 percent of the budget of 
        the Administration, with the remaining 30 percent 
        coming from the General Fund. The General Fund 
        contribution over the years is one measure of the 
        benefit received by the general public, military, and 
        other users of Administration's services.
            (3) The Administration must become a more 
        efficient, effective, and different organization to 
        meet future challenges.
            (4) The need to balance the Federal budget means 
        that it may become more and more difficult to obtain 
        sufficient General Fund contributions to meet the 
        Administration's future budget needs.
            (5) Congress must keep its commitment to the users 
        of the national air transportation system by seeking to 
        spend all moneys collected from them each year and 
        deposited into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. 
        Existing surpluses representing past receipts must also 
        be spent for the purposes for which such funds were 
        collected.
            (6) The aviation community and the employees of the 
        Administration must come together to improve the 
        system. The Administration must continue to recognize 
        who its customers are and what their needs are, and to 
        design and redesign the system to make safety 
        improvements and increase productivity.
            (7) The Administration projects that commercial 
        operations will increase by 18 percent and passenger 
        traffic by 35 percent by the year 2002. Without 
        effective airport expansion and system modernization, 
        these needs cannot be met.
            (8) Absent significant and meaningful reform, 
        future challenges and needs cannot be met.
            (9) The Administration must have a new way of doing 
        business.
            (10) There is widespread agreement within 
        government and the aviation industry that reform of the 
        Administration is essential to safely and efficiently 
        accommodate the projected growth of aviation within the 
        next decade.
            (11) To the extent that Congress determines that 
        certain segments of the aviation community are not 
        required to pay all of the costs of the government 
        services which they require and benefits which they 
        receive, Congress should appropriate the difference 
        between such costs and any receipts received from such 
        segment.
            (12) Prior to the imposition of any new charges or 
        user fees on segments of the industry, an independent 
        review must be performed to assess the funding needs 
        and assumptions for operations, capital spending, and 
        airport infrastructure.
            (13) An independent, thorough, and complete study 
        and assessment must be performed of the costs to the 
        Administration and the costs driven by each segment of 
        the aviation system for safety and operational 
        services, including the use of the air traffic control 
        system and the Nation's airports.
            (14) Because the Administration is a unique Federal 
        entity in that it is a participant in the daily 
        operations of an industry, and because the national air 
        transportation system faces significant problems 
        without significant changes, the Administration has 
        been authorized to change the Federal procurement and 
        personnel systems to ensure that the Administration has 
        the ability to keep pace with new technology and is 
        able to match resources with the real personnel needs 
        of the Administration.
            (15) The existing budget system does not allow for 
        long-term planning or timely acquisition of technology 
        by the Administration.
            (16) Without reforms in the areas of procurement, 
        personnel, funding, and governance, the Administration 
        will continue to experience delays and cost overruns in 
        its major modernization programs and needed 
        improvements in the performance of the air traffic 
        management system will not occur.
            (17) All reforms should be designed to help the 
        Administration become more responsive to the needs of 
        its customers and maintain the highest standards of 
        safety.

SEC. 222. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to ensure that final action shall be taken on 
        all notices of proposed rulemaking of the 
        Administration within 18 months after the date of their 
        publication;
            (2) to permit the Administration, with 
        Congressional review, to establish a program to improve 
        air traffic management system performance and to 
        establish appropriate levels of cost accountability for 
        air traffic management services provided by the 
        Administration;
            (3) to establish a more autonomous and accountable 
        Administration within the Department of Transportation; 
        and
            (4) to make the Administration a more efficient and 
        effective organization, able to meet the needs of a 
        dynamic, growing industry, and to ensure the safety of 
        the traveling public.

        Service do not lead to an agreement, the 
        Administrator's proposed change to the personnel 
        management system shall not take effect until 60 days

        within the Administration's annual budget as it applies 
        to each of the affected bargaining units and throughout 
        the agency.
    ``(b) Expert Evaluation.--On the date that is 3 years after 
the personnel management system is implemented, the 
Administration shall employ outside experts to provide an 
independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the system

provided by this title, all labor-management agreements 
covering employees of the Administration that are in effect on

  Subtitle C--System To Fund Certain Federal Aviation Administration 
                               Functions

SEC. 271. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Administration is recognized throughout the 
        world as a leader in aviation safety.
            (2) The Administration certifies aircraft, engines, 
        propellers, and other manufactured parts.
            (3) The Administration certifies more than 650 
        training schools for pilots and nonpilots, more than 
        4,858 repair stations, and more than 193 maintenance 
        schools.
            (4) The Administration certifies pilot examiners, 
        who are then qualified to determine if a person has the 
        skills necessary to become a pilot.
            (5) The Administration certifies more than 6,000 
        medical examiners, each of whom is then qualified to 
        medically certify the qualifications of pilots and 
        nonpilots.
            (6) The Administration certifies more than 470 
        airports, and provides a limited certification for 
        another 205 airports. Other airports in the United 
        States are also reviewed by the Administration.
            (7) The Administration each year performs more than 
        355,000 inspections.
            (8) The Administration issues more than 655,000 
        pilot's licenses and more than 560,000 nonpilot's 
        licenses (including mechanics).
            (9) The Administration's certification means that 
        the product meets worldwide recognized standards of 
        safety and reliability.
            (10) The Administration's certification means 
        aviation-related equipment and services meet world-wide 
        recognized standards.
            (11) The Administration's certification is 
        recognized by governments and businesses throughout the 
        world and as such may be a valuable element for any 
        company desiring to sell aviation-related products 
        throughout the world.
            (12) The Administration's certification may 
        constitute a valuable license, franchise, privilege or 
        benefits for the holders.
            (13) The Administration also is a major purchaser 
        of computers, radars, and other systems needed to run 
        the air traffic control system. The Administration's 
        design, acceptance, commissioning, or certification of 
        such equipment enables the private sector to market 
        those products around the world, and as such confers a 
        benefit on the manufacturer.
            (14) The Administration provides extensive services 
        to public use aircraft.

SEC. 272. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this subtitle are--
            (1) to provide a financial structure for the 
        Administration so that it will be able to support the

        options, including incentive-based fees for services, 
        and establish a program to improve air traffic

        appropriate levels of cost accountability for air 
        traffic management services provided by the 
        Administration;
            (3) to ensure that any funding will be dedicated 
        solely for the use of the Administration;
            (4) to authorize the Administration to recover the 
        costs of its services from those who benefit from, but 
        do not contribute to, the national aviation system and 
        the services provided by the Administration;
            (5) to consider a fee system based on the cost or 
        value of the services provided and other funding 
        alternatives;
            (6) to develop funding options for Congress in 
        order to provide for the long-term efficient and cost-
        effective support of the Administration and the 
        aviation system; and
            (7) to achieve a more efficient and effective 
        Administration for the benefit of the aviation

                    TERRORISM.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) there has been an intensification in the 
        oppression and disregard for human life among nations 
        that are willing to export terrorism;
            (2) there has been an increase in attempts by 
        criminal terrorists to murder airline passengers 
        through the destruction of civilian airliners and the 
        deliberate fear and death inflicted through bombings of 
        buildings and the kidnapping of tourists and Americans 
        residing abroad; and
            (3) information widely available demonstrates that 
        a significant portion of international terrorist 
        activity is state-sponsored, -organized, -condoned, or 
        -directed.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate 
that if evidence establishes beyond a clear and reasonable 
doubt that any act of hostility towards any United States 
citizen was an act of international terrorism sponsored, 
organized, condoned, or directed by any nation, a state of war 
should be considered to exist or to have existed between the 
United States and that nation, beginning as of the moment that 
the act of aggression occurs.

                 TITLE VIII--AIRPORT REVENUE PROTECTION

SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Airport Revenue Protection 
Act of 1996''.

SEC. 802. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) In General.--Congress finds that--
            (1) section 47107 of title 49, United States Code, 
        prohibits the diversion of certain revenue generated by 
        a public airport as a condition of receiving a project 
        grant;
            (2) a grant recipient that uses airport revenue for 
        purposes that are not airport related in a manner 
        inconsistent with chapter 471 of title 49, United 
        States Code, illegally diverts airport revenues;
            (3) any diversion of airport revenues in violation 
        of the condition referred to in paragraph (1) 
        undermines the interest of the United States in 
        promoting a strong national air transportation system 
        that is responsive to the needs of airport users;
            (4) the Secretary and the Administrator have not 
        enforced airport revenue diversion rules adequately and 
        must have additional regulatory tools to increase 
        enforcement efforts; and
            (5) sponsors who have been found to have illegally 
        diverted airport revenues--
                    (A) have not reimbursed or made restitution 
                to airports in a timely manner; and
                    (B) must be encouraged to do so.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to ensure that 
airport users are not burdened with hidden taxation for 
unrelated municipal services and activities by--
            (1) eliminating the ability of any State or 
        political subdivision thereof that is a recipient of a 
        project grant to divert airport revenues for purposes 
        that are not related to an airport, in violation of 
        section 47107 of title 49, United States Code;
            (2) imposing financial reporting requirements that 
        are designed to identify instances of illegal 
        diversions referred to in paragraph (1);
            (3) establishing a statute of limitations for 
        airport revenue diversion actions;
            (4) clarifying limitations on revenue diversion 
        that are permitted under chapter 471 of title 49, 
        United States Code; and
            (5) establishing clear penalties and enforcement 
        mechanisms for identifying and prosecuting airport 
        revenue diversion.

    ``(a) Prohibition.--Local taxes on aviation fuel (except 
taxes in effect on December 30, 1987) or the revenues generated 
by an airport that is the subject of Federal assistance may not 
be expended for any purpose other than the capital or operating 
costs of--
            ``(1) the airport;
            ``(2) the local airport system; or
            ``(3) any other local facility that is owned or 
        operated by the person or entity that owns or operates

provision enacted not later than September 2, 1982, in a law 
controlling financing by the airport owner or operator, or a

the revenues, including local taxes on aviation fuel at public 
airports, from any of the facilities of the owner or operator, 
including the airport, be used to support not only the airport 
but also the general debt obligations or other facilities of 
the owner or operator.
    ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be 
construed to prevent the use of a State tax on aviation fuel to 
support a State aviation program or the use of airport revenue 
on or off the airport for a noise mitigation purpose.''.
    (b) Penalties.--Section 46301(a)(5) is amended to read as

        title (or any assurance made under such section) or 
        section 47133 of this title may be increased above the 
        otherwise applicable maximum amount under this section 
        to an amount not to exceed 3 times the amount of 
        revenues that are used in violation of such section.''.
    (c) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for such 
subchapter is amended by inserting after the item relating to 
section 47132, as added by section 142 of this Act, the 
following:

        provided for an airport) to include as part of an 
        annual audit conducted under sections 7501 through 7505 
        of title 31, a review and opinion of the review

SEC. 1212. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE FUNDING OF THE FEDERAL 
                    AVIATION ADMINISTRATION.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--
            (1) Congress is responsible for ensuring that the 
        financial needs of the Federal Aviation Administration, 
        the agency that performs the critical function of 
        overseeing the Nation's air traffic control system and 
        ensuring the safety of air travelers in the United 
        States, are met;
            (2) aviation excise taxes that constitute the 
        Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which provides most of 
        the funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, 
        have expired;
            (3) the surplus in the Airport and Airway Trust 
        Fund will be spent by the Federal Aviation 
        Administration by December 1996;
            (4) the existing system of funding the Federal 
        Aviation Administration will not provide the agency 
        with sufficient short-term or long-term funding;
            (5) this Act creates a sound process to review 
        Federal Aviation Administration funding and develop a 
        funding system to meet the Federal Aviation 
        Administration's long-term funding needs; and
            (6) without immediate action by Congress to ensure 
        that the Federal Aviation Administration's financial 
        needs are met, air travelers' confidence in the system 
        could be undermined.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate 
that there should be an immediate enactment of an 18-month 
reinstatement of the aviation excise taxes to provide short-
term funding for the Federal Aviation Administration.

SEC. 1213. RURAL AIR FARE STUDY.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct a study to--

                    (A) between--
                            (i) nonhub airports located in 
                        small communities; and
                            (ii) large hub airports; and
                    (B) between large hub airports;
            (2) analyze--
                    (A) the extent to which passenger service 
                that is provided from nonhub airports is 
                provided on--
                            (i) regional commuter commercial 
                        air carriers; or
                            (ii) major air carriers;
                    (B) the type of aircraft employed in 
                providing passenger service at nonhub airports; 
                and
                    (C) whether there is competition among 
                commercial air carriers with respect to the 
                provision of air service to passengers from 
                nonhub airports.
    (b) Findings.--The Secretary shall include in the report of 
the study conducted under subsection (a) findings concerning--
            (1) whether passengers who use commercial air 
        carriers to and from rural areas (as defined by the 
        Secretary) pay a disproportionately greater price for 
        that transportation than passengers who use commercial 
        air carriers between urban areas (as defined by the 
        Secretary);
            (2) the nature of competition, if any, in rural 
        markets (as defined by the Secretary) for commercial 
        air carriers;
            (3) whether a relationship exists between higher 
        air fares and competition among commercial air carriers 
        for passengers traveling on jet aircraft from small 
        communities (as defined by the Secretary) and, if such 
        a relation exists, the nature of that relationship;
            (4) the number of small communities that have lost 
        air service as a result of the deregulation of 
        commercial air carriers with respect to air fares;
            (5) the number of small communities served by 
        airports with respect to which, after commercial air 
        carrier fares were deregulated, jet aircraft service 
        was replaced by turboprop aircraft service; and
            (6) where such replacement occurred, any 
        corresponding decreases in available seat capacity for 
        consumers at the airports referred to in that 
        subparagraph.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a final 
report on the study carried out under subsection (a) to the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the 
Senate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
of the House of Representatives.

                                Managers on the Part of the Senate.
       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3539) to amend 
title 49, United States Code, to reauthorize programs of the 
Federal Aviation Administration, and for other purposes, submit 
the following joint statement to the House and the Senate in 
explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the 
managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report:
      The Senate amendment struck all of the House bill after 
the enacting clause and inserted a substitute text.
      The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the Senate with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
House bill and the Senate amendment. The differences between 
the House bill, the Senate amendment, and the substitute agreed 
to in conference are noted below, except for clerical 
corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements 
reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clerical 
changes.

      The Managers note that the Laser Visual Guidance Systems 
(LVGS) is a laser based guidance system that has been tested 
extensively by the Navy and suggest that FAA consider this 
system for utilization in the National Airspace System (NAS). 
The Conferees further suggest that the FAA work with the 
manufacturer to evaluate the fitness of the system for possible 
certification under 14 FAR Part 171.
      The Secretary of Transportation should take such actions 
as may be necessary to replace the FAA Control Tower at 
Syracuse Hancock International Airport in Syracuse, New York. 
All design and engineering work on the Replacement Control 
Tower has been completed and the Managers understand that this 
project is the top priority of the FAA's Eastern Region.

                      6. operations authorization

House bill
      Section 103:
      FY 97--$5.158 billion.

      Section 103: House, except for 2 years and the Trust Fund 
share is raised to 72.5%.

                      7. interaccount flexibility

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 105: Permits the Administrator to transfer budget 
authority among the Operations, F&E, and RE&D appropriations 
accounts. Transfers of budget authority could not be made if 
outlays would exceed the aggregate estimated outlays. A 
transfer also could not result in a net decrease of more than 5 
percent, or a net increase of more than 10 percent, in budget 
authority available under any appropriation involved in that 
transfer. Any transfer would be treated as a reprogramming of 
funds and could only occur after the FAA submitted a report to 
the appropriate authorizing and appropriating committees of 
Congress. Each committee would have 30 days to object to any 
transfer.
Conference substitute
      House.

                        8. passenger entitlement

House bill
      Section 201(a)(1): Same as current law except that 
airports receive 50 cents per passenger for each passenger over 
a million.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 121(a): House provision.

                          9. CARGO ENTITLEMENT

House bill
      Section 210(a)(2): Entitlement changed to 2.5%. Airports 
that do not meet landed-weight minimum can still get grant 
under this entitlement if the Secretary finds that airport will 
be served primarily by cargo aircraft.
Senate amendment
      No change.
Conference substitute
      Section 121(a)(2): House provision.

                          10. ENTITLEMENT CAPS

House bill
      Section 201(a)(3): Caps eliminated
Senate amendment
      No change.
Conference substitute
      House provision: Section 121(a)(3).

                         11. STATE ENTITLEMENT

House bill
      Section 201(b): Raised to 18.5%. Relievers and small 
commercial service airports added.
Senate amendment
      No change.
Conference substitute
      House provision: Section 121(b).

                         12. DISCRETIONARY FUND

House bill
      Section 202: Must be at least $50 million plus amount 
needed to cover letters of intent issued prior to 1/1/96. 
Entitlement and set-asides reduced accordingly if necessary to 
meet this minimum. Amount in fund above what is needed to cover 
letters of intent is distributed 15% to planning & general 
aviation airports and 30% to small hubs and non-hubs.
Senate amendment
      Section 203: FAA must fulfill letter of intent (LOI) 
commitments.
Conference substitute
      Section 122: House except that $50 million is changed to 
$148 million and the 15% guarantee to general aviation airports 
and the 30% guarantee to small airports is eliminated. In FY 
97, this should result in a remaining discretionary fund of 
$300 million. The Managers would expect this to be distributed 
in accordance with FAA's historical discretionary fund 
distribution practices. If the formula results in a 
discretionary fund of more than $300 million, the portion that 
exceeds $300 million should be distributed one-third to general 
aviation airports, one-third to noise projects, and one-third 
to the military airport program.

                  13. CAP ON GRANTS TO LARGE AIRPORTS

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendments
      Section 202: Establishes a sliding cap on the level of 
total AIP funds going to large and medium hubs. The percentage 
limit would vary depending upon the level of funds appropriated 
to AIP. The percentage of total AIP funds going to projects at 
large and medium hub airports would be: 44.3 percent at funding 
of $1.45-1.55 billion; 44.8 percent at funding of $1.35-1.45 
billion; 45.4 percent at funding of $1.25-1.35 billion; 46 
percent at funding of $1.15-1.25 billion; and 47 percent at 
funding below $1.15 billion.
Conference substitute
      House.

                       14. CARRYOVER ENTITLEMENTS

House bill
      Section 203(a): Non-hubs can carry over their 
entitlements for 3 years.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      House provision: Section 123(a).

                             15. SET-ASIDES

House bill
      Section 203(b): Eliminates reliever, small commercial, 
and planning set-asides. Set-aside for noise is 31% of 
discretionary fund. This includes what an airport spends on 
noise from its entitlement. Set-aside for military airports is 
4% of the discretionary fund. This can be used for operational 
and maintenance at general aviation airports adversely affected 
by a military base closure.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      House provision: Section 123(b).

                      16. MILITARY AIRPORT PROGRAM

House bill
      Section 204:
      Reduces number of airports to 10.
      Changes criteria so that airports could be included if 
they would increase capacity in major metropolitan areas and 
reduce delays.
      Extends indefinitely eligibility of parking lots, fuel 
farms, and utilities.
      Adds hangars to eligible items.
      Also, Section 203(b) extends program indefinitely.
Senate amendment
      Section 204:
      Reduces number of airports to 12.
      Criteria changed so that except for airports included 
before August 24, 1994, the only ones that could be included 
would be closed or realigned military airports or those that 
would reduce delays at an airport with 20,000 annual delays or 
would increase capacity in metropolitan areas or reduce delays.
      A military airport may be designated for additional 5-
year period.
      Extends indefinitely eligibility of parking lots, fuel 
farms, and utilities.
      Extends program for 1 year.
Conference substitute
      Section 124:
      Senate provision but add eligibility for hangars from 
House bill.
      Extend program length for 2 years.

                        17. innovative financing

House bill
      Section 206: Authorizes 10 innovative financing projects 
over next 3 years limited to payment of interest, bond 
insurance, and flexible local match. Phased funding is not 
included.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 148: House provision.

                        18. intermodal planning

House bill
      Section 301: This section encourages coordination between 
aviation planning and other transportation planning in the 
metropolitan area and encourages Metropolitan Planning 
Organizations (MPOs) to include airport operators as members. 
Subsection (b) requires the sponsor of a new airport to give 
the MPO a chance to review plans for the new airport and 
include in the AIP grant application its response to any 
comments made by the MPO.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 141: House provision but drop subsection (b).

                          19. federal mandates

House bill
      Section 302: This section broadens the ability of AIP and 
PFC funds to be used to pay for Federal mandates.
Senate amendment
      Section 201(b): Similar provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 142(b): Senate provision.

                         20. runway maintenance

House bill
      Section 303: Permits AIP grants for up to 10 runway 
maintenance projects per year at general aviation airports.
Senate amendment
      Section 201: Similar but requires issuance of 
regulations. Two projects must be in states without a medium or 
large hub. In designating projects, FAA must take into account 
geographical, climatological, and soil diversity.
Conference substitute
      Section 142(a): Senate provision, but the Administration 
will issue guidelines instead of regulations.

                          21. intercity buses

House bill
      Section 304: A new grant assurance directing airports to 
try to provide access to intercity buses.
Senate amendment
      Section 206: Similar grant assurance except it applies to 
other modes of transportation and explicitly states that the 
airport does not have to fund any special facilities as a 
result of this provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 143: Senate provision.

                         22. cost reimbursement

House bill
      Section 305:
      This section allows AIP grants to be used to reimburse an 
airport for a project already underway. This reimbursement must 
be from the airport's entitlement funds and the grant can be 
made only if:
            (i) The project is begun after September 30, 1996;
            (ii) A grant agreement is executed for the project; 
        and
            (iii) The project is in accordance with the 
        airport's approved layout plan and complies with all 
        laws, rules, and assurances that usually apply to AIP 
        grants.
      Subsection (b) states that an airport will not receive 
any priority for discretionary funds if its entitlement turns 
out to be insufficient to cover reimbursement for the project.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 144: House provision.

                          23. Letter of Intent

House bill
      Section 306: This section requires the Secretary to issue 
rules requiring a cost-benefit analysis for new letters of 
intent (LOI) for projects at medium and large hub airports. No 
letters of intent can be issued for projects not yet under 
construction until these rules take effect even if the airport 
has already applied for the LOI. A request for a letter of 
intent must include specific details of the proposed financing 
plan for the project. The Secretary must consider the effect of 
the project on overall national air transportation policy when 
deciding whether to issue a letter for a project.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Senate provision: The Managers understand that concerns 
have been voiced regarding previous management by the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) for Letters of Intent (LOI) under 
the Airport Improvement Program. As outlined in GAO/RCED-94-
100, the FAA has been criticized for not ``establish[ing] goals 
and performance measures for the [LOI] program, including a 
goal for improving systemwide capacity.'' Recognizing the need 
for a clear set of selection criteria to review all new LOI 
applications, the FAA promulgated a new review policy, as 
printed in the Federal Register on October 31, 1994, which 
evaluates three components of an application: a project's 
effect on overall national air transportation system capacity; 
a project's benefit and cost, and; the financing commitment, 
including project timing, in terms of the airport capital 
improvement plan by the airport sponsor. The Managers applaud 
the FAA's efforts on this matter and direct FAA officials to 
consider each of the three requirements prior to issuance of 
any Letters of Intent.

        24. selection criteria for award of discretionary grants

House bill
      Section 307: This section adds three additional criteria 
to be considered in the award of discretionary grants. They are 
the priority that a State gives to the project, the projected 
growth in passengers at the airport, and whether the number of 
passengers has increased by more than 20 percent over the 
previous 12-month period.
Senate amendment
      Section 203: Adds two additional criteria. They are (1) 
at a reliever airport, the number of operations projected to be 
diverted to the reliever airport as a result of the project and 
the cost savings to be realized by the users and (2) the 
priorities of the States and FAA regional offices to the extent 
they are not in conflict with the other criteria of this 
section.
Conference substitute
      Section 145: Both House bill and Senate amendment.

                         25. small airport fund

House bill
      Section 308: This section states that in making grants to 
non-hub airports from the small airport fund, the Secretary 
shall give priority to multi-year projects for construction of 
new runways that are cost beneficial and would increase 
capacity in a region of the U.S.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 146: House provision.

                         26. State Block Grant

House bill
      Section 309: This section changes the state block grant 
program by increasing the number of participating states from 7 
to 10, directing FAA to permit States to use their own priority 
system when not inconsistent with the national priority system, 
and making the program permanent.
Senate amendment
      Section 205:
      Directs FAA to permit States to use their own priority 
system when not inconsistent with the national priority system.
      Extends program for one year.
Conference substitute
      Section 147:
      House provision, except the number of states is increased 
to 8 in 1997 and 9 in 1998. Many airport sponsors own and 
operate more than one airport. For instance, an entity may 
serve as the sponsor of a primary airport, and it may also own 
and operate one or more reliever airports. The sponsor in 
essence maintains an integrated airport system.
      In a State Block Grant Program state, the state has been 
designated the responsibility for distributing federal grant 
funds to the state's reliever airports. The Managers are aware, 
however, of instances in which a State Block Grant state has 
entered into an agreement with the Federal Aviation 
Administration, under which the appropriate FAA regional office 
continues to determine and distribute grant funds to particular 
reliever airports that are owned and operated by a sponsor that 
also owns and operates a primary airport.
      The Managers support continuation of this type of 
arrangement. It would be inefficient and unnecessarily 
duplicative for an airport sponsor that owns and operates a 
primary airport and one or more reliever airports as an 
integrated system to be subject to two different sets of grant 
procedures and standards (both federal and state) in the 
execution and administration of federal AIP grants. The 
Managers encourage the continuation of this arrangement between 
the FAA and the state, even when the law provides that states 
shall hold the authority to administer reliever airport funds.

                       27. airport privatization

House bill
      Section 310:
      Creates a pilot program permitting, subject to DOT 
approval, the sale or long-term lease of 6 airports. The 
sponsor and the potential purchaser must file an application. 
DOT may grant the application by issuing three exemptions. The 
first exemption would waive the revenue diversion prohibitions 
to permit the public owner to make money from the sale but only 
an amount agreed to by 60 percent of the airlines serving that 
airport with 60 percent of the landed weight. The second 
exemption would waive the requirements in law and FAA policy 
guidance that AIP grants be repaid and land received from the 
Federal government be returned. The third exemption would 
permit the new owner to receive compensation from operating the 
airport.
      Subsection (c) of new section 47133 lists the conditions 
that must be met by an airport sale or lease agreement. These 
conditions are provisions to ensure that; (1) the airport will 
be available to the public on reasonable terms and without 
discrimination; (2) the airport will continue in operation 
without interruption in the event the new owner goes bankrupt; 
(3) the new owner will maintain and improve the airport and 
include a plan for doing so; (4) airline fees will not increase 
faster than inflation unless more than 60 percent of the 
airlines with 60 percent of the landed weight agree to higher 
rates; (5) safety at the airport will be maintained; (6) noise 
from the airport will be mitigated; (7) environment impacts 
will be mitigated; and (8) collective bargaining agreements of 
airport employees will not be abrogated.
      At least one of the privatized airports is to be a 
general aviation airport. The private airports under this 
section are authorized to charge a PFC, receive AIP entitlement 
grants, and charge users reasonable rates, fees, and charges 
like other airports. The new owner is required to continue to 
use the facility as an airport. The exemptions issued under 
this section may be revoked if, after notice and hearing, DOT 
finds that the purchaser or lessee has knowingly violated any 
of the commitments that it made in the purchase or lease 
agreement.
      Subsection (h) of new section 47133 clarifies that the 
power of airlines over use of revenue and fees in this section 
applies only to the airports purchased or leased under this 
section and not to other airports.
      Subsection (b) of this section makes private airports 
subject to the same prohibition on head taxes as public 
airports.
      Subsection (c) requires DOT to consider whether the 
private airport has complied with the requirement that airline 
fees not increase faster than the rate of inflation in deciding 
a rates and charges complaint against that airport.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 149:
      House provision with following changes or clarifications:
            Reduce number of participating airports from 6 to 5
            1 large, 3 medium, small, or non-hubs, and 1 
        general aviation airports are eligible for this pilot 
        program
            65% of airlines must agree to transactions and to 
        rate hikes. If 1 carrier represents 65% of landed 
        weight then 2 airlines must approve for transactions 
        and rate hikes.
            Discretionary AIP grants allowed but only if 
        sanctioned by FAA Administrator with 60% private money 
        match to 40% Federal
            2-year study of the pilot program with a report to 
        appropriate Congressional committees
            DOT Secretary must validate that any airport 
        privatized would not be anti-competitive requirement 
        that airport operator has to improve and modernize 
        airport through capital investments
            Secretary has authority to audit airport anytime.
            Rate hikes on general aviation shall rise no faster 
        than those of commercial carriers.
            Secretary shall consider needs of general aviation 
        when approving privatization
            Commercial service airports limited to long-term 
        leases. Lease or sale permitted for general aviation 
        airports.
      The Managers have agreed to a limited pilot program to 
determine if new investment and capital from the private sector 
can be attracted through innovative financial arrangements. The 
managers spent a great deal of time discussing and debating a 
series of conditions and limitations. The managers are aware 
that Allegheny County Airport, a general aviation facility in 
Pennsylvania, and Stewart Airport in New York State are 
interested in pursuing these innovative arrangements. The 
managers anticipate that all airport applications should be 
appropriately considered and that the Secretary should select 
airports for this pilot program based on the best qualified 
candidates.

   28. Use of Noise Abatement Funds by Non-Airport Local Governments

House bill
      Section 311: This section permits noise abatement grants 
to be made to State or local government that is not the 
airport's owner if that government has land use and zoning 
control in the area and if the airport agrees that the State or 
local government's noise abatement plan or project is 
consistent with airport operations and plans.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Senate.

                            29. Dual Mandate

House bill
      Section 401: Amends sections 40101(d) to make safety and 
security FAA's highest priority and to strike promotion 
language in two other paragraphs. Amends 40104(a) to strike 
promotion language.
Senate amendment
      Section 407: Amends section 40104 to require FAA to 
encourage the safety of air commerce in addition to the 
development of civil aeronautics.
Conference substitute
      Section 401: House changes to section 40101(d) and Senate 
changes to section 40104(a). The Managers have adopted 
provisions from both the House and Senate bills to clarify that 
the FAA's highest priority is safety and security. The managers 
do not intend for enactment of this provision to require any 
changes in the FAA's current organization or functions. 
Instead, the provision is intended to address any public 
perceptions that might exist that the promotion of air commerce 
by the FAA could create a conflict with its safety regulatory 
mandate.

                     30. Purchase of Housing Units

House bill
      Section 402: This section permits FAA to purchase housing 
outside the 48 States if the unit does not cost more than 
$200,000 and the FAA files a report with Congress 30 days 
before the closing certifying that the price of the units does 
not exceed the median price in the area and that buying the 
housing is the most cost beneficial way to provide housing for 
its employees.
Senate amendment
      Section 401: Similar provision except no $200,000 cap and 
no certification that price does not exceed the median price.
Conference substitute
      Section 1201: House except the cap is raised to $300,000 
plus inflation in the local area.

          31. technical correction relating to state taxation

House bill
      Section 403: This section corrects a mistake that was 
made when section 1113 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 
U.S.C. 1513) was recodified as section 40116 of Title 49.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      No provision. The managers recognize that this technical 
correction has created confusion. In order to provide more time 
for review, the provision has not been included in this bill. 
However, the managers continue to believe that the 
recodification of section 1113 was done incorrectly and would 
expect that the new section 40116 would continue to be 
interpreted in the same way as former section 1113.

               32. use of pfc for debt financing project

House bill
      Section 404: This section permits revenue from an 
airport's passenger facility charge (PFC) to be spent on debt 
financing on terminal development projects at non-hub airports 
where construction began between November 5, 1988 and November 
5, 1990 and the airport certifies that no safety, security, or 
capacity project will be deferred by spending PFC money in this 
way.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Senate.

      33. clarification of pfc revenue as constituting trust funds

House bill
      Section 405: States that PFC money collected by airlines 
is held in trust by them and that they hold neither a legal or 
equitable interest in it except for the handling fee or 
interest permitted by DOT.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 1202: House provision.
      This provision clarifies Congress' intent in authorizing 
the Passenger Facility Charge program in 1990 that PFCs 
collected by airlines and their agents are held in trust for 
the local agencies imposing those fees. FAA's current 
regulations implementing the PFC statute accurately reflects 
the trust fund nature of the airlines' collection and 
remittance of PFC funds from their passengers. In certain 
recent and current airline bankruptcy cases, courts have 
appeared erroneously not to accept the trust fund nature of the 
collection process; PFC proceeds should not be treated as other 
funds of the bankrupt carrier.

              34. voluntarily submitted safety information

House bill
      Section 406:
      This section permits FAA to withhold voluntarily provided 
safety and security information if disclosure would discourage 
people from providing it, the information helps FAA improve 
safety and security, and withholding the information would not 
be inconsistent with the FAA's safety and security 
responsibilities.
      The FAA should issue rules to establish the process by 
which protection from disclosure will be afforded to 
voluntarily submitted information.
Senate amendment
      Section 402: Same provision with slight wording 
differences.
Conference substitute
      Section 402: Senate provision.

                   35. supplemental type certificates

House bill
      Section 407: This section states that FAA may issue 
supplemental type certificates (STCs) for modifications to 
aircraft parts. It requires anyone installing the modification 
to have the permission of the holder of the STC to use it.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Section 403: House provision.
      Nothing in this provision is intended to alter or modify 
the continuing obligation of an STC design holder under 
existing Federal Aviation Regulations to notify the operator of 
an STC modified aircraft of changes necessary to ensure 
continued airworthiness of the product.

                         36. Revenue Diversion

House bill
      Section 408: This section imposes the existing 
prohibition against revenue diversion on all airports 
certificated by FAA even if they are not receiving AIP grants. 
This provision does not apply to heliports. Airports that have 
not received grants in the last 10 years can get waivers from 
the FAA. Subsection (b) imposes treble damages on anyone caught 
illegally diverting airport revenue.
Senate amendment
      Section 904:
      Prohibits using local taxes (except taxes effective on 
December 30, 1987) or revenues generated by an airport that is 
subject to Federal assistance, for anything but capital and 
operating costs of the airport, the local airport system, or 
other facilities owned or operated by the airport that are 
directly related to air transportation.
      Exemption for airports who had a statute passed before 
September 2, 1982 allowing revenue to support the general debt 
obligations or other facilities of the owner or operator.
      State tax on aviation may still support aviation noise 
mitigation purposes.
      Section 905:
      Requires the annual audit required in Sections 7501-7505 
of Title 31 of airport grant recipients include an audit of 
funding activities. If the airport is found to inappropriately 
handle airport funds, the Administrator must review the audit, 
collect appropriate information, and hold a hearing to render a 
final determination if the airport illegally diverted revenues. 
The Airport sponsor is then notified. The Secretary may 
withhold transportation funds if the sponsor is found to owe 
the airport revenue. Sponsor has 180 days to pay or may be 
charged civil penalties which would go to the aviation trust 
fund. Actions to recover illegally diverted funds have a 6 year 
statute of limitations.
      The Secretary shall charge a minimum interest rate of 
illegally diverted revenue. In 90 days, DOT shall revise the 
policies and procedures under 47107(i) of Title 49. If an 
airport pays for services conducted off the airport for capitol 
or operating expenses later than 6 years after the expense was 
incurred, it is considered revenue diversion.
      Section 906: This is a conforming amendment to the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Conference substitute
      Title VIII:
      Senate, but add treble damages from the House bill.
      The conferees want to clarify that if a local fuel tax 
was enacted or adopted before December 30, 1987, but for which 
collections were not made until some significant period of time 
after December 30, 1987, it shall not be grandfathered pursuant 
to this section and all proceeds of such a tax must be used for 
the capital or operating costs of the airport, the local 
airport system, or pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection (a).

                  37. certification of small airports

House bill
      Section 409:
      This section authorizes FAA to certificate airports 
served by commuter aircraft with between 10 and 30 seats. In 
establishing the standards with which these small airports must 
comply, the FAA should adopt the least burdensome alternative 
that will provide a comparable level of safety with the larger 
airports. Any rule imposing standards on these small airports 
cannot go into effect until 120 days after the rule, and a 
report on the impact of the rule on air service to the airports 
involved, is submitted to Congress.
      An airport cannot be required to seek a certificate if it 
does not desire commuter air service.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      House provision: Section 404.

                        38. pilot record sharing

House bill
      Section 410. This is based on H.R. 3536 (Report 104-684) 
that passed the House on July 22, 1996.
      Adds a new section 44723 to the chapter on air safety 
regulation.
      Subsection (a) of section 44723 deals with pilot records. 
This subsection would require an airline, before hiring a 
pilot, to request the pilot's records. The hiring airline would 
be required to request from the FAA, the pilot's license, 
medical certificate, type rating, and any enforcement actions 
that resulted in a finding against the pilot that has not been 
overturned.
      In addition, it requires the airline to request records 
from the pilot's previous airline employer. These records 
include proficiency and route checks, airplane and route 
qualifications, training, physical exams, physical or 
professional disqualifications, drug tests and alcohol tests.
      Airlines would be required to request the motor vehicle 
driving records of the pilot from the National Driver Register.
      Similar items would be required at contract carriers and 
at commuter airlines.
      Records that must be furnished are limited to those 
entered within 5 years of the date of the request unless the 
record involves a license revocation that is still in effect.
      The FAA and the airlines would be required to maintain 
the relevant records for 5 years. Before any records are 
released, the FAA and the airlines must obtain written consent 
from the pilot. These records must be provided within 30 days.
      The pilot must also be informed within 20 days that his 
or her records have been requested and that the pilot has a 
right to receive a copy of those records. A reasonable charge 
may be imposed by those providing the requested records.
      An airline receiving the records must give the pilot a 
chance to submit written comments correcting any inaccuracies 
in those records. The pilot is also afforded the right to 
review his or her records at the current employer.
      The privacy of the pilot is protected by limiting the use 
of the records received under this section to those involved in 
the hiring decision and by requiring that the records be 
destroyed or returned when they are no longer needed.
      The FAA would be permitted to provide standard forms to 
request records, obtain the written consent from pilots, and 
inform the pilot of the record request. In addition, this 
section would permit the FAA to promulgate rules protecting the 
privacy of pilots and ensuring the prompt compliance with a 
request for records.
      Subsection (b) of section 44723 limits liability and 
preempts States and local law. Paragraph (1) prohibits lawsuits 
against an airline or its employees for requesting a pilot's 
record, complying with such a request, or entering information 
into the pilot's record. Paragraph (2) preempts any State or 
local government from passing any law which would undermine 
this prohibition. However, paragraph (3) provides a limited 
exception to the prohibition in paragraph (1) by permitting a 
lawsuit or State action if the airline knowingly provided false 
information about the pilot.
      Subsection (c) of section 44723 makes clear that the 
privacy protections and other limits in this bill are not meant 
to hinder the FAA, NTSB, or a court in their ability to obtain 
records in the course of an investigation of an accident. This 
section also makes conforming changes to the current law 
governing the National Driver Register.
      Subsection (d) makes violations of the record-sharing and 
privacy provisions subject to civil penalties.
      Subsection (e) makes the above changes applicable to any 
airline hiring a pilot 30 days after the date of enactment.
      Requires the FAA to issue a proposed rule within 18 
months establishing minimum standards for pilot qualifications.
      Requires the FAA, together with the Defense Department, 
to report within one year on whether military pilot records 
should be made available to civilian airlines seeking to hire 
that pilot.
      Requires the FAA to conduct a study to determine whether 
current minimum flight time requirements for an individual 
seeking employment as a pilot with an air carrier are 
sufficient. The results of this study must be submitted to 
Congress not later than 1 year after the date of enactment.
Senate amendment
      Sections 701-703: Same as House except:
      Different short title.
      Uses phrase ``hiring an individual as a pilot'' rather 
than ``allowing individual to begin service as a pilot''.
      No exception for records on flight, duty, and rest time.
      No requirement that FAA obtain written consent from the 
pilot before releasing records (b)(2).
      Permits airlines to obtain a release from liability 
(f)(2)(B).
      No requirement that air carrier or trustee maintain 
records for 5 years. (f)(4).
      30 day deadline for furnishing records runs from receipt 
of request rather than from receipt of pilot's consent. (f)(5).
      No deadline for providing record to pilots. (f)(6).
      Promulgation of standard forms is mandatory rather than 
discretionary. (f)(8).
      No requirement to destroy or return records if the pilot 
is not hired.
      Adds a periodic review.
      No protection from liability for person writing the 
records.
      Exception from liability for knowingly providing false 
information applies only if record was maintained in violation 
of a criminal statute.
      No assurance that DOT, NTSB, and courts will have access 
to pilot records.
      No civil penalties.
      No deadline on study of minimum standards for pilots.
      No study of military records.
      No study of minimum flight times.
Conference substitute
      Title V:
      Senate with the following provisions from the House 
bill--
      Air carrier records to be shared with prospective 
employers should not include records relating to flight time, 
duty time, or rest time.

      Records must be furnished to a pilot in 20 days of 
receipt of request
      Protection from liability for person entering information 
into the records
      Assurance that FAA, NTSB, and the courts will have access 
to the records.
    A study of minimum flight times.
      A study of pay for training is also added.

                         39. child pilot safety

House bill
      Section 411. This is based on H.R. 3267 (Report 104-683) 
that passed the House on July 22, 1996.
      States that a pilot in command of an aircraft may not 
allow an individual who does not hold a valid private pilots 
certificate and the appropriate medical certificate to 
manipulate the controls of an aircraft if the pilot knows or 
should have known that the individual is attempting to set a 
record or engage in an aeronautical competition or feat. The 
Administrator is given the power to revoke an airman's 
certificate if the Administrator finds that a pilot has allowed 
a non-pilot to manipulate the controls while attempting to set 
a record or engage in an aeronautical competition or feat.
      Requires the FAA Administrator to conduct a study of the 
impacts of children flying aircraft. The Administrator must 
consider the effects of imposing any restrictions on children 
flying aircraft on safety and on the future of general 
aviation. The report is due 6 months after enactment, and 
should include recommendations on: (1) whether the restrictions 
established by the bill should be amended or repealed; and (2) 
whether certain individuals or groups should be exempt from any 
age, altitude, or other restrictions that the Administrator may 
impose by regulation. Finally, the bill allows the 
Administrator to issue regulations imposing age, altitude, or 
other restrictions on children flying aircraft as a result of 
the findings of the study.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      House provision: Title VI.

                   40. Background Checks on Screeners

House bill
      Section 412: This section permits FAA to require airlines 
to do background checks before hiring someone to screen 
passengers, their baggage, or cargo. This could include 
criminal history record checks only where the background 
investigation revealed a gap in employment of a year or more 
that is not satisfactorily explained. This applies only to 
screeners hired on or after the date of enactment. A screener 
may be hired while undergoing a background check if properly 
supervised.
Senate amendment
      Section 305: Require background checks for screeners and 
others associated with baggage or cargo. Lists situations 
where, at a minimum, ciminal checks required.

      The Managers want to clarify that the funds generated by 
the airport should be spent on capital and operating costs of 
the airport. The assumption is that the expenditures from the 
treasury of Westchester County for the Westchester County 
Airport will be equal to or greater than the fees being 
deposited into the treasury by the airport, otherwise it should 
be considered revenue diversion.

                             59. FAA Reform

House bill
      No provision although the House passed a FAA reform 
measure (H.R. 2276, Report 104-475) in March 1996.
Senate amendment
      Title VI:
      Section 601 cites the short title of title VI as the 
``Air Traffic Management System Performance Improvement Act of 
1996''.
      Section 602 defines the terms ``Administration'', 
``Administrator'', and ``Secretary'' for the purposes of this 
title of the bill.
      Section 603 establishes that the provisions of title VI 
will take effect 30 days after enactment of the legislation.
      Section 621 sets forth a series of findings establishing 
the general basis for enactment of the provisions contained in 
title VI. The findings recognize, for example, the unique 
character of the FAA's activities and the need for funding 
reform.
      Section 622 sets forth four critical purposes 
underpinning title VI.
      Section 623 amends section 106 of title 49, United States 
Code, to provide the FAA Administrator express autonomy and 
authority with regard to the internal functioning of the 
agency. As the current law provides, the FAA Administrator 
would be appointed by the President, with the advice and 
consent of the Senate, for a fixed, 5-year term.
      Some authority previously transferred to the DOT under 
the Department of Transportation Act (P.L. 89-670) would be 
recommitted to the FAA under this section. The Administrator 
would be the final authority for: the promulgation of all FAA 
rules and regulations (except as otherwise specifically 
provided in the bill); and for any obligation, authority, 
function, or power addressed in the bill.
      This section enables the Administrator to delegate his or 
her functions, power, or duties to other FAA employees. 
Further, the Administrator would not need to seek the approval 
or advice of the DOT on any matter within the authority of the 
Administrator.
      Nevertheless, the FAA remains within the DOT, which would 
continue to provide general oversight of the agency as well as 
cooperate with the more autonomous FAA.
      This section also gives the Administrator some voice in 
the selection of the eight political appointees who serve under 
him or her. The President would consult closely with the 
Administrator when considering FAA appointments to ensure 
harmony and stability within the FAA's leadership.
      This section adds a definition of ``political appointee'' 
to the statute. This section also preserves all authority 
vested in the Administrator (by delegation or by statute) prior 
to enactment of the bill. Nothing in this bill is meant to take 
anything away from any of the current powers, duties, or 
authority resting with the FAA or its Administrator.
      Section 624 affirms the Administrator's authority to 
issue, rescind and revise such regulations as necessary to 
carry out the functions of the FAA. The Administrator would be 
required to act upon a petition for rulemaking within six 
months by dismissing the petition, by informing the petitioner 
of an intention to dismiss, or by issuing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) or advance notice of proposed rulemaking 
(ANPRM).
      This section also requires the Administrator to issue a 
final regulation, or take other final actions, on an NPRM 
within 18 months of the date it is published in the Federal 
Register (or within 24 months in the case of an ANPRM).
      Under this section, the DOT's authority to review FAA 
rules is limited. In specified, limited circumstances, the FAA 
could not issue certain regulations without the prior approval 
by the DOT. The DOT Secretary would have 45 days to review, for 
approval or disapproval, any FAA regulation likely to result in 
an annual, aggregate cost of $50 million or more to state, 
local, and tribal governments, or to the private sector. The 
DOT Secretary would also have 45 days to review ``significant'' 
regulations, which are rules that, in the judgment of the 
Administrator (in consultation with the Secretary, as 
appropriate), are likely to: have an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or adversely affect in a material way 
other parts of the society; be inconsistent or otherwise 
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, 
user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues 
arising out of legal mandates.
      This section also provides that in an emergency, the 
Administrator may issue regulations that require DOT approval 
without obtaining such prior approval. Such regulations, 
however, are subject to DOT ratification, and would be 
rescinded within 5 business days without such ratification. 
Under this section, the Administrator also would issue non-
significant regulations or other actions that are routine, 
frequent or procedural in nature, without review or approval by 
the DOT. Examples of routine of frequent actions that are non-
significant include standard instrument approach procedure 
regulations, en route altitude regulations, most airspace 
actions, and airworthiness directives. The DOT also would not 
be authorized to review ``rules of particular applicability,'' 
such as exemptions, operations specifications, and special 
conditions, all of which apply to one individual or entity, 
unless such exemptions met the definition of significant in 
this section.
      Finally, this section requires the FAA (three years after 
the bill is enacted) to review ``unusually burdensome'' 
regulations that are at least three years old. ``Unusually 
burdensome'' regulations are defined as those that result in 
the annual, aggregate expenditure of $25 million or more by 
State, local, and tribal governments, or by the private sector. 
Such regulations are to be reviewed to determine: the accuracy 
of the original cost assumptions; the overall benefit of the 
regulations; and the need to continue such regulations in their 
present form. This section also provides that the Administrator 
may review immediately any three-year-old regulation in force 
prior to enactment of the bill.
      Section 625: Provides that the Administrator may appoint 
and fix the compensation of necessary employees and officers of 
FAA. This section also provides that, in fixing the 
compensation and benefits of employees, the Administrator may 
not engage in any type of bargaining, except as provided for 
under section 653 of the bill. Further, this section provides 
that the Administrator shall not be bound by any requirement to 
establish compensation or benefits at particular levels. This 
section also provides other personnel authority to the 
Administrator, including, for example, the authority to hire 
experts and consultants and to use the services of personnel 
from any other Federal agency.
      This section also provides that officers and employees 
shall be appointed in accordance with civil service laws and 
compensated in accordance with title 5, United States Code, 
except as otherwise provided by law.
      Section 626: Provides broad, general authority for the 
Administrator to enter into contracts, leases, cooperative 
agreements, and other transactions, as necessary to carry out 
the functions of the FAA.
      Section 627: Provides the Administrator with authority to 
use or accept, with or without reimbursement, services, 
equipment, personnel, and facilities of any other Federal 
agency or public or private entity. Such acceptance would not 
constitute an agumentation of the Administration's budget. 
Heads of other Federal agencies would be asked to cooperate 
with the Administrator.
      Section 628: Provides broad authority to the 
Administrator to acquire, construct, improve, repair, operate, 
and maintain air traffic control and research facilities and 
equipment, as well as other real and personal property to 
others.
      Section 629: Permits the Administrator to accept the 
transfer of unobligated balances and unexpended funds from 
other agencies to carry out functions assigned to FAA by this 
or other Acts.
      Section 630: Establishes a 15-member Federal Aviation 
Management Advisory Council (MAC) to provide the Administrator 
with input from the aviation industry and community. The MAC 
would be comprised of one designee each of the Secretaries of 
Transportation and Defense and representatives from various 
segments of the aviation community who would be appointed by 
the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. 
Members of the MAC should be selected from among individuals 
who are experts in disciplines relevant to the aviation 
community and who are collectively able to represent a balanced 
view of the issues before the FAA. The MAC members also should 
not be selected based on political or partisan considerations.
      This section would subject MAC members to criminal 
penalties for unauthorized disclosure of commercial or other 
proprietary information.
Conference substitute
      Senate provision: The managers recognize that to provide 
reform of the FAA, additional autonomy in decision-making in a 
number of areas is needed. For this reason, the managers agreed 
to give the FAA authority in the regulatory, personnel, and 
procurement areas. This change should result in a new way of 
doing business for the FAA, with less oversight by DOT.

                     60. Aircraft Engine Standards

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 631: Requires the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) to consult with FAA on aircraft emission standards. Also, 
EPA shall not change the emission standards if it would 
significantly increase noise and adversely affect safety. FAA 
should allow EPA to participate in advisory committees when 
appropriate.

Senate amendment
      Section 632: Requires DOT to conduct a study of rural air 
fares, and to provide a report to the Commerce Committee within 
60 days after enactment of this bill. The study would encompass 
an analysis of the types of air service provided to rural 
communities as well as competitive aspects of such air service.
Conference substitute

Infrastructure Committee added as a recipient of the report.

                            62. Procurement

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Sections 651, 652:
      Not later than April 1, 1999 the FAA must employ outside 
experts to provide an independent evaluation of the 
effectiveness of its acquisition system. The FY 1996 DOT 
Appropriations bill (P.L. 104-50) gave the FAA authority to 
implement new procurement and personnel systems as of April 1, 
1996.
      Section 652 establishes a safeguard, built into the 
procurement system, that would require the FAA to terminate 
facilities and equipment programs that are 50 percent or more: 
(1) over cost, (2) below performance goals, or (3) behind 
schedule. The Administrator could waive the termination 
requirement if a termination would be inconsistent with the 
safe and efficient operation of the national air transportation 
system. Also, the FAA would be required to consider terminating 
any program that is 10 percent or more: (1) over cost, (2) 
below performance goals, or (3) behind schedule.
      Specific exceptions to termination are allowed.
Conference substitute
      Senate provision.

                             63. Personnel

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 653:
      Directs the Administrator, in developing and making 
changes to the new personnel system, to consult with FAA 
employees and negotiate with the exclusive bargaining 
representatives of employees. If the Administrator fails to 
reach agreement with such bargaining units, the parties will 
engage the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation 
Service. If agreement is not reached following such mediation, 
proposed changes to the personnel system shall not take effect 
until 60 days have elapsed after the Administrator has 
submitted the proposed change, any objections of the exclusive 
bargaining representatives, and the reasons for such 
objections, to the Congress. In negotiating changes to the 
personnel system, the Administrator and the exclusive 
bargaining representatives would be required to use every 
reasonable effort to find cost savings and to increase 
productivity within each of the affected bargaining units, as 
well as within the FAA as a whole. Nothing in this bill, 
therefore, prohibits the exclusive bargaining representatives 
from assisting in identifying cost savings in the procurement 
system as well as the new personnel system.
      Three years after the personnel management system is 
implemented, outside experts should be employed by the 
Administration to evaluate the program's effectiveness.
      Until July 1, 1999, basic wages should not be 
involuntarily adversely affected by this section, except for 
unacceptable performance, or by a reduction in force, or by a 
reorganization.
      Except as otherwise provided by Section 653, all labor-
management agreements that are in effect at the time of passage 
shall remain in effect until their normal expiration, unless 
otherwise agreed to.

                            64. faa funding

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Sections 671, 672:
      Section 671 sets forth fourteen findings establishing the 
general basis for the provisions related to FAA funding. These 
findings concern the important services provided by the FAA in 
a variety of critical areas that benefit the users of the air 
transportation system.
      Section 672 sets forth seven critical purposes underlying 
the enactment of Title VI of the bill. Those purposes include 
providing a financial structure for the FAA that would enable 
it to support the future growth in the national aviation, ATC, 
and airport system. The third purpose, which is to ensure that 
any funding would be dedicated solely for the use of the FAA, 
is in reference to the user fees authorized under section 673.
Conference substitute
      Senate provision.

                                65. fees

House bill
      Section 413: This section authorizes FAA to impose fees, 
up to $30 million per year, on aircraft that overfly the U.S. 
but do not land here. The aggregate annual amount of these fees 
should not exceed the aggregate annual direct costs incurred by 
the FAA in providing air traffic services to such flights. 
Further, the user fee imposed on any flight should be based on 
the FAA's actual cost of service.
Senate amendment
      Section 673: Directs FAA to impose fees, up to $100 
million per year, on (1) aircraft that overfly the U.S. but do 
not land, (2) services provided to foreign governments (other 
than air traffic control services). The fees shall be based on 
the direct total cost of providing the service. FAA shall 
publish an initial fee schedule subject to public comment. 
Nongovernmental experts may be used to develop fees. Repeals 
section 70118. S. 1194 permitted the FAA to base its fee system 
on total costs or value. Value was deleted during debate on the 
bill.
Conference substitute
      Section 273: Senate provision except the repeal of 
section 70118 is deleted and clarification is provided as to 
the method of setting user fees. The user fee imposed on any 
flight must be based on the FAA's actual cost of service and 
not on any non-cost based determination of the ``value'' of the 
service provided. Further, assuming similar costs of serving 
different carrier and aircraft types, the user fee may not vary 
based on factors such as aircraft seating capacity or revenues 
derived from passenger fares.

                          66. study commission

House bill
      Section 205: Establishes National Civil Aviation Review 
Commission to study safety, airport capital needs and ways to 
meet those needs, and FAA operational needs and ways to meet 
those needs. Appointments made by DOT and relevant 
Congressional Committees. DOT cannot appoint current aviation 
employees. Independent audit of FAA financial requirements. GAO 
assessment of airport needs. Final report due in 1 year.
Senate amendment
      Section 674:
      This section requires the DOT to contract with an outside 
entity to conduct a comprehensive FAA needs and cost allocation 
assessment of the financial requirements of the FAA through 
2002. The assessment must be completed within 90 days of the 
contract being awarded. The DOT should establish an 11-member 
task force within 30 days with people who have expertise in 
aviation, represent a balanced view of different aviation 
interests and include one member who knows the Congressional 
budget process. The task force submits a report to DOT based on 
the assessment by the outside entity. DOT submits a report to 
Congress within one year.
      This section also requires that, within 120 days, GAO 
must conduct an assessment of the manner in which costs for ATC 
services are allocated between the FAA and the DOD.
Conference substitute
      Section 274:
      Senate provision except that the Senate's 11 member task 
force is renamed the Commission in the House bill and expanded 
to 21 members, 13 appointed by the Secretary, 2 appointed by 
the House Republican leadership, 2 appointed by the House 
Democrat leadership, and 2 by the Senate majority leader and 2 
by the minority leader of the Senate. The Commission is divided 
into 2 task forces, one dealing with the safety issues in the 
House bill and the other with the funding issues in the Senate 
bill. It also includes the GAO assessment of airport needs from 
the House bill.
      The purpose of this assessment is to determine 
independently what the financial needs of the FAA will be in 
the short- and long-term. The assessment also must include a 
cost allocation analysis detailing which segments of the 
aviation community are driving the various costs imposed on the 
FAA. Costs attributed to users should reflect the full range of 
FAA expenditures and activities associated directly or 
indirectly with a particular aviation segment, including, for 
example, costs of airport infrastructure financed in whole or 
in part by the FAA. This assessment is urgently needed by the 
task force, Congress, and the aviation community so proper 
evaluation of the FAA's financial picture can be done using a 
single, objective set of numbers and assumptions.
      The recommendations of the task force may include a 
variety of possibilities, such as alternate funding proposals, 
taking the trust fund off budget, user fee system proposals, 
modifications to the aviation excise tax system, a combination 
of excise taxes and user fees, and means of meeting airport 
infrastructure needs. The task force also shall consider a 
limited, innovative program for airport-related funding 
mechanisms. For each recommendation, the task force must assess 
the impact on safety, administrative costs, the Congressional 
budget process, industry economics, the ability of the FAA to 
use sums collected, and the needs of the FAA. The report should 
detail various options, with the benefits and impacts of each.
      The conferees believe the assessment must contain an 
analysis of current and future spending of the entire FAA, 
including airport capital needs. A major premise of this 
legislation is that old assumptions and old ways of doing 
business must be re-evaluated and updated. This includes an 
independent assessment of the FAA's needs and the nation's 
airport capital needs to ensure that capacity is able to meet 
demand. As a result, the task force, Congress and the FAA must 
be in a position to determine which projects expand capacity 
and enhance the safety and security of the national air 
transportation system.
      The assessment should provide assistance to Congress as 
to appropriate reforms, which will allow the FAA and airports 
to more efficiently utilize and maximize Airport Improvement 
Program (AIP) dollars for necessary capacity, safety, and 
security.
      The conferees agree that the task force in identifying 
the needs and associated costs of the FAA task force should use 
as a baseline not less than the FY 1997 appropriated levels 
including the supplemental amounts. Following recent accidents 
and a 90-day review conducted by the FAA that found that 
additional staffing needs have been identified, the conferees 
agree that the task force recommendations should fully meet 
these and any other security and safety requirements or other 
unmet and underfunded needs.
      The conference agreement includes the provisions of the 
House bill which would establish an aviation safety task force. 
Under the terms of the conference agreement, this safety task 
force shall be formed by the membership of the National Civil 
Aviation Review Commission. The safety task force should submit 
a report to the FAA which sets forth a comprehensive analysis 
of aviation safety.
      The conferees recognize that at this time, the Vice 
President is leading a similar study of aviation safety with 
the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. It 
should be noted that the safety study required under the bill 
is not intended to duplicate the Gore Commission. Rather, it is 
intended and anticipated that the safety study in this bill 
will build on the experience and recommendations of the Gore 
Commission.

Senate amendment
      Section 675 sets forth expedited procedures.
Conference substitute
      Section 275: Expedited procedures apply only to the 
Senate.

                    68. budgetary treatment of fees

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 676 creates a separate, dedicated account 
(established in the Treasury) for all new fees and other 
receipts (except for those associated with the Aviation 
Insurance Program) collected by the FAA. The receipts and 
disbursements of this account would be awardable immediately 
for expenditures of Congressionally authorized programs and 
shall remain available until expended.
      Annually, the Administrator shall submit a Report on the 
fees including a list of fees, the activities supported by 
fees, and any proposed disposition of surplus fees.
      This section also requires the FAA to develop a cost 
accounting system.
      This section also provides that when an air carrier is 
required by the Administrator, pursuant to this legislation, to 
collect a fee imposed on a third party by the FAA, the 
Administrator shall ensure that such air carrier may collect 
from such third party an additional uniform amount reflecting 
necessary and reasonable expenses (net of interest) incurred in 
collecting and handling the fee.
      Section 676(a)(7) requires that the Administrator provide 
to the Congress, prior to the submission of any proposed user 
fee or excise tax schedule, a report justifying the need for 
the proposed user fees or taxes and including other specified 
information such as steps the Administrator has taken to reduce 
costs and improve efficiency within FAA.
Conference substitute

Senate amendment.

                       69. Essential Air Service

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 678: Authority to administer and operate the EAS 
program would be transferred from the DOT Secretary to the 
Administrator. The program would be established at a $50 
million level, with authority of the program to be funded by 
user fees collected under this legislation, including those 
specifically derived from overflights. At the end of each 
fiscal year, if less than $50 million has been obligated for 
EAS programs, the Administrator shall make those remaining 
amounts available under the Airport Improvement Program for 
grants to rural airports to improve rural air safety. This 
section also, in effect, repeals a provision in the current law 
sunsetting the EAS program.
Conference substitute
      Section 278: Senate provision except the transfer of the 
EAS program from DOT to FAA is eliminated. EAS funding for '97 
is equal to the amount appropriated plus any user fee revenue 
above $75 million that is collected pursuant to Section 
45301(a)(1).

       72. assistance to families involved in airlines accidents

House bill
      H.R. 3923 (Report 104-793) which passed the House on 
September 18, 1996, directs NTSB to take action to help 
families including designating a liaison and an independent 
organization and obtaining passenger lists. Also directs 
airlines to submit plans, establishes a task force to study 
further improvements, and prohibits unsolicited lawyer contact.
Senate bill
      Requires NTSB to establish a program to provide family 
advocacy services, work with airlines to procure services of 
family advocates. Guidelines must be issued in 90 days.
Conference substitute
      Title VII:
      House bill with the following changes:
            The list of parties that are prohibited from making 
        unsolicited communications with family members or 
        injured victims is expanded to include potential 
        adverse parties to the litigation.
            ``within the control of the air carrier'' is added 
        to the requirement that air carriers assure that the 
        family of each passenger will be consulted about the 
        disposition of all remains and personal effects of the 
        passenger.
            The model plan is changed to guidelines to make 
        clear that it is intended to serve as guidance for 
        airlines developing plans and not as a precursor to 
        requiring airlines to revise existing plans that may be 
        perfectly sound.
            The Task Force developing the guidelines for air 
        carriers is also asked to study the implications for 
        personal privacy if air carriers were required to 
        notify passengers more quickly. The concern is that 
        such a requirement may entail an airline requesting 
        more information from passengers than many people may 
        consider appropriate.

                     73. safety data classification

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 303: NTSB must develop system for classifying 
accidents within 90 days. Provision for public comment, report 
to Congress, and presentation to ICAO.
      Also requires FAA to give high priority to deploying 
safety performance analysis system.
Conference substitute
      Section 407: Senate amendment with revised language.
      The Managers are interested in having accurate 
statistical information available to the public with regard to 
aviation accidents. Currently, accident information can be 
misleading in that certain occurrences are categorized as 
accidents that do not fit the public perception of an aviation 
accident. It is important that the public understand the 
aviation accident data it receives so that informed decisions 
can be made on the basis of that data. This legislation 
requires the National Transportation Safety Board to amend its 
categorization of aviation accidents to make the information 
more user friendly. After public comment, the NTSB is required 
to publish, on a periodic basis, aviation accident data, as 
recategorized. The Managers believe the accident data should be 
published on a timely basis and made widely available to the 
general public so that informed decisions can be made by the 
traveling public. Dissemination through the NTSB's web page 
would be one means of widely distributing the information.

Commission. Sense of Senate that FAA should work with airlines 
& airports on feasible, effective bag match.
Conference substitute
      Section 311: Senate provision but require only if baggage 
match program is actually carried out. This is intended to 
remove any implication that this provision is designed to 
mandate such a baggage match program. Includes sense of Senate.

                     82. enhanced security programs

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 313: Requires airlines and airports to 
periodically assess their security. The FAA must periodically 
audit these assessments and make unannounced and anonymous 
inspections and tests of security systems.
Conference substitute
      Section 312: Senate provision.

                             83. air cargo

House bill
      Section 107 of H.R. 3953 lists 3 items relating to air 
cargo for FAA to study.
Senate bill
      Section 314: Requires DOT to report on changes 
recommended by the Gore Commission with respect to air cargo.
      Sense of the Senate that inspection of cargo, mail, and 
company shipped material can be enhanced.
Conference substitute
      Section 313:
      Senate bill except FAA is directed to do study and the 3 
items from the House bill are incorporated.
      Includes Sense of the Senate.

                       84. supplemental screening

House bill
      Section 109 of H.R. 3953 directs FAA to consider using 
bomb sniffing dogs to supplement existing bomb detection 
systems. Section 110 authorizes Trust Fund spending for 
training and evaluation of K-9 teams at 50 largest airports.
Senate amendment
      No provision.
Conference substitute
      Added to section 305 (item 75) above by permitting the 
requirement to deploy commercially available explosive 
detection equipment to be met at airports by the deployment of 
dogs or other appropriate animals to supplement equipment for 
screening passengers, baggage, mail, or cargo for explosives or 
weapons.

                       85. carriage of candidates

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 408 states that the same rules must apply to 
carriage of candidates in Federal and State elections.
Conference substitute
      Section 1214: Senate provision.

                     86. Train Whistle Requirements

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 409: Prohibits implementation of DOT rule 
requiring train whistles at grade crossings.
Conference substitute
      Section 1218: Senate provision with changes.
      The conferees, in adopting these changes to Section 20153 
of Title 49, United States Code, do not intend to require the 
Secretary to begin anew the current rulemaking already underway 
to implement this provision. Instead, the Secretary should 
incorporate the new additional criteria into his completion of 
the existing proceeding. Similarly, because the conference 
language retains the original focus of rules under Section 
20153 on categories of crossings, not individual crossings, the 
implementation of this provision should not be affected by 
references to individual crossings in the conference report 
accompanying the recently approved Department of Transportation 
appropriations legislation. Finally, the conferees urge the 
Secretary to consider in implementing the regulations, the 
impact of those regulations on the quality of life in affected 
communities.

                        87. Gambling on Vessels

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment

      Section 1222: Senate provision.

                      88. Grand Canyon Rulemaking

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 411 requires FAA to provide 30 additional days 
for comments.
Conference substitute
      Section 1215: Senate provision, but change to 45 days and 
include environmental assessment comment period.

 89. Fees for Services in Connection With Rail Maximum Rate Complaints

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 412 prohibits the Surface Transportation Board 
from increasing these fees.
Conference substitute
      The conferees share the concern, reflected in the Senate 
provision, that the cost-based fees collected by the Surface 
Transportation Board pursuant to its existing Title 31 
authority should not impose an unfair burden on small shippers 
seeking redress before the Board through maximum-rate 
complaints. The protection reflected in the conference 
provision will prevent any such increases until the Congress 
has reauthorized the STB, which is required by the end of 
Fiscal Year 1998.

                            90. Hickory, nc

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 413: Permits transfer of a control tower to 
Hickory, directs study of whether tower meets criteria of 
contract tower program, and prohibits closure of New Bern 
Flight Service Station unless FAA makes required certification.
Conference substitute
      Senate provision.

                      91. international terrorism

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 414: Sense of Senate that state sponsored

to DOT on the number of bids and the amount by which the 
winning bid exceeded the lowest bid.
Conference substitute
      House.

              93. Employee retirement income security act

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 416: Relates to limited scope audit.
Conference substitute
      House.

 94. advance electronic transmission of cargo and passenger information

House bill
      No provision.
Senate amendment
      Section 417: Requires airlines to provide the manifest in 
advance.
Conference substitute
      The Managers have receded to the House position. Senator 
Graham offered the provision in a desire to improve safety and 
security. The Managers are aware of the importance of the need 
for the Customs Service to work with the airlines to provide 
the highest levels of protection to the traveling public. The 
decision not to include the specific language should not be 
read to suggest a lack of agreement with the spirit and intent 
of the provision.

      95. technical corrections to the icc termination act of 1995

Conference substitute
      This provision corrects a technical error in the ICC 
Termination Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-88) (``ICCTA''). As 
part of the abolition of the former Interstate Commerce 
Commission and the reduction of economic regulation of 
railroads and trucking, the ICCTA included a number of 
conforming amendments to other statutes which had referred to 
the ICC. Among these conforming amendments were changes to the 
Railway Labor Act. The Railway Labor Act governs labor 
relations and collective bargaining in the airline and railroad 
industries; it does not apply to motor carriers.
      The ICCTA stated unequivocally that its enactment ``did 
not expand or contract coverage of employers or employees under 
the Railway Labor Act.'' 49 U.S.C. 10501(c)(3)(B). However, 
because of a drafting error, the ICCTA conforming provision 
(Section 322) removed the term ``express company'' from the 
railroad part of the Railway Labor Act. This could be 
interpreted as inconsistent with the clear bipartisan intent 
not to alter the boundaries of the Railway Labor Act in any 
way. Therefore, the technical amendment made by this section 
merely restores the exact legal standards for coverage under 
the Railway Labor Act that existed prior to enactment of the 
ICCTA. Otherwise, the current text of the law could cause 
needless confusion and punish both employers and employees who 
have relied upon the prior text and settled interpretation of 
the Railway Labor Act.
