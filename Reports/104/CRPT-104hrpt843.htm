        program to evaluate and implement opportunities for 
        public-private partnerships in the design, 
        construction, management, or operation of dredged

                management, or operation of a dredged material 
                disposal facility (including any facility used 
                to demonstrate potential beneficial uses of 
                dredged material) using funds provided in whole

                to effectively distribute dredging work

        date of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary 
        shall report to Congress on whether the vessel placed 
        in ready reserve status under paragraph (2) is needed

                any Federal hopper dredge below a ready reserve

                for not less than 5 years that the Secretary 
                determines has not been used sufficiently to 
                justify retaining the vessel in such status.
                    ``(B) Increase in assignments of dredging 
                work.--For each fiscal year beginning after the 
                date of the enactment of this subsection, the 
                Secretary shall not assign any greater quantity 
                of dredging work to any Federal hopper dredge

                years.
                    ``(C) Remaining dredges.--In carrying out 
                the program under this section, the Secretary 
                shall not reduce the availability and 
                utilization of Federal hopper dredge vessels 
                stationed on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts 
                below that which occurred in fiscal year 1996 
                to meet the navigation dredging needs of the 
                ports on those coasts.
            ``(8) Contracts; payment of capital costs.--The 
        Secretary may enter into a contract for the maintenance 
        and crewing of any Federal hopper dredge retained in a 
        ready reserve status. The capital costs (including 
        depreciation costs) of any dredge retained in such 
        status shall be paid for out of funds made available 
        from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and shall not be 
        charged against the Corps of Engineers' Revolving Fund 
        Account or any individual project cost unless the 
        dredge is specifically used in connection with that 
        project.''.

                      Title II--General Provisions

       SEC. 201 COST SHARING FOR DREDGED MATERIAL DISPOSAL AREAS

      House Sec. 201, Senate Sec. 336--Senate Recedes with an 
amendment to Subsections (d) and (g).
      This section assures a consistent approach to the Federal 
and non-Federal responsibilities for providing dredged material 
disposal areas. By requiring the same cost sharing for disposal 
activities, whether they involve open water discharge or 
discharge into confined sites or similar methods, non-Federal 
project sponsors will have greater certainty regarding their 
cost sharing responsibilities during project development. 
Importantly, this section will result in benefits to the 
aquatic environment by reducing inordinate pressure for open 
water disposal, which may be less costly but may, in some 
cases, not be preferable from an environmental point of view.
      To address situations in which projects involving dredged 
material disposal facilities could be inadvertently 
disadvantaged by the provisions of this section, the section 
includes a provision that assures that no increase in non-
Federal costs will result from its application. Among the 
projects that will not have their non-Federal share increased 
are the modification or enlargement of existing confined 
dredged material disposal facilities at Norfolk Harbor, 
Virginia; Cleveland Harbor, Ohio and Green Bay Harbor, 
Wisconsin.

                     SEC. 202 FLOOD CONTROL POLICY

      House Sec. 202, no comparable Senate section--Senate 
recedes with an amendment.
      The conferees have included several provisions in section 
202 which modify the flood control program of the Corps of 
Engineers, reflecting an evolution in national flood control 
policy. The conferees have deleted the provision in the House 
bill to allow additional review of the proposal without 
prejudice to its substance. The conferees expect the Corps to 
continue to consider nonstructural alternatives as required by 
existing law, and encourage the Corps to improve its efforts at 
considering nonstructural alternatives in its project study and 
formulation. Such consideration should include watershed 
management, wetlands restoration, elevation, and relocation. 
The Corps is also encouraged to explore alternatives which may 
be implemented by others, beyond the authority of the Corps. 
Examples of such alternatives include changes in zoning or 
development patterns by local officials. Because the Corps has 
no authority to implement such recommendations, such options 
are generally not explored or displayed in Corps study 
documents. However, such alternatives could, in some cases, 
result in a more effective flood protection program at reduced 
cost to both Federal and non-Federal interests.
      Such alternatives are consistent with current approaches 
to flood control and recent congressional actions related to 
reducing Federal expenditures for flooding. For example, 
Congress enacted the Hazard Mitigation and Flood Damage 
Reduction Act of 1993, in direct response to the disastrous 
flooding in the Midwest in 1993. This law allows for increased 
use of relocation in response to flooding. It would be prudent 
for the Corps to also increase its review of nonstructural 
alternatives prior to flooding.
      The conferees on the part of the House have receded to 
the Senate and deleted subsection 202(f) of the House bill. 
Subsection (f) would have amended section 73 of the Water 
Resources Development Act of 1974 to place a greater emphasis 
on including proposals for nonstructural alternatives to reduce 
or prevent flood damages in the surveying, planning or design 
of projects for flood protection.
      202(a) Flood Control Cost Sharing.--House Sec. 202, 
Senate Sec. 337--Senate recedes with an amendment.
      202(b) Ability to Pay.--House Sec. 202(b)--Senate recedes 
with an amendment.
      The continuing problem of non-Federal project sponsors' 
ability to provide the required cost sharing for flood control 
projects has been addressed by this legislation. First enacted 
in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986 and 
modified in WRDAs of 1990 and 1992, the Corps of Engineers has 
implemented congressional direction concerning ability-to-pay 
in a manner that has resulted in little assistance to 
financially distressed communities in need of relief from 
flooding. Section 202 addresses this problem with specific 
guidance to the Secretary. It is essential that prudent, yet 
meaningful ability-to-pay procedures be implemented. This is 
especially important in light of the increase in the non-
Federal share of project costs for future project 
authorizations that is provided for in section 202. The 
Secretary's progress in implementing this section.

             SEC. 203 COST SHARING FOR FEASIBILITY STUDIES

      House Sec. 203, Senate Sec. 314--Senate recedes with an 
amendment.
      This section addresses the chronic problem of excessive, 
unpredictable cost increases that non-Federal sponsors incur in 
participating with the Corps in feasibility studies. The 
provision allows that, except in limited circumstances, study 
costs in excess of the amount specified in the feasibility 
cost-sharing agreement may be repaid by the non-Federal study 
sponsor after the project is authorized for construction. The 
Corps is expected to improve its procedures for preparing study 
cost estimates and to work with non-Federal study sponsors as 
full partners in the development and conduct of studies.
      It has been brought to the attention of the conference 
committee that the Corps is administratively shortening the 
period allowed for reconnaissance studies and is requiring its 
field offices to complete such studies for $100,000. While the 
Corps' desire to expedite the planning process is admirable, it 
is believed that there are potential shortcomings in this 
approach. First, it may reduce the amount of information 
available to potential non-Federal feasibility study sponsors 
on the likelihood of feasible and acceptable project 
alternatives. Second, it potentially increases the amount of 
time, effort and funds that will be required in the cost-shared 
feasbility study. Third, the policy may not be flexible enough 
to address those water resources issues that are complex or 
geographically broad. Implementing any policy that has a high 
likelihood of increasing non-Federal costs, but whose effect on 
shortening the overall study process is speculative, would not 
serve the long-term infrastructure needs of the Nation. The 
Corps is to address these concerns as it implements the policy.

      This section reflects a comprehensive initiative for 
improving the safety of the Nation's dams with a flexible, non-
regulatory approach to dam safety issues. By providing 
financial incentives for training, research, and data 
collection and by facilitating intergovernmental coordination 
and the exchange of information, state and local governments 
and non-governmental entities will be better equipped to 
address dam safety issues. This section does not affect Federal 
responsibilities relating to the construction or operation of 
dams, or to the regulation, permitting or licensing of dams, by

      This section addresses recent policy decisions made by 
the Corps to reduce its role in the implementation of projects 
designed to reduce shoreline erosion damages. Such projects are 
important to preserving economic vitality of the Nation's 
coastal areas. These projects provide essential protection 
against devastating storms and often yield substantial benefits 
to recreation as well. Shore protection projects are subject to 
the same technical, environmental and economic analysis as 
other types of water resources projects. While budget realities 
are of great concern, the Corps' role in such projects should 
be arbitrarily end. The Corps is to continue to pursue feasible 
projects on an equal footing with other water resources 
projects.

      The conferees on the part of the House have receded to 
the Senate on House amendment section 581, Huntington, West 
Virginia. That section would have authorized the Secretary to 
enter into a cooperative agreement with Marshall University to 
provide technical assistance to the Center for Environmental, 
Geotechnical and Applied Sciences. The new authority for the 
Secretary contained in section 229, Support of Army Civil Works 
Program, is sufficient to allow the Secretary to enter into the 
agreement contemplated by House section 581. Therefore, the 
Secretary is directed to pursue an appropriate cooperative 
agreement with Marshall University under section 229 as 
expeditiously as practicable.

                        sec. 237 hopper dredges

      House Sec. 517, no comparable Senate section--Senate 
recedes with an amendment.
      This section would establish a program to increase the 
Corps use of private dredging equipment by placing the Federal 
dredge Wheeler in a ready reserve status. In implementing the 
program, the Secretary would be required to develop and 
implement procedures to ensure that private hopper dredging 
capacity is available to meet routine and time-sensitive 
dredging needs. Although the managers expect the private 
dredging industry to be able to meet many navigation needs, 
because the Wheeler will be in ready reserve status, the 
procedures should allow for the Wheeler to be placed into 
service within a few days of a need arising. Should an 
emergency situation arise in any region, the program would 
allow for the Wheeler to be transferred from ready reserve 
status and to be placed into service in a few days, rather than 
waiting for as much as two weeks, or longer, for one of the 
remaining Federal dredges to be transferred to the area.
      The Secretary would evaluate the results of the program 
periodically by reporting to the appropriate Congressional 
Committees on the impact of the program on private industry and 
Corps hopper dredge costs, responsiveness, and capacity.
      Over the past ten years, the port communities in the 
Pacific Northwest and the Middle Atlantic have been heavily 
dependent on the Corps hopper dredges, the Yaquina, the 
Essayons, and the McFarland, respectively. These vessels are 
being used to meet the navigation dredging needs of their 
respective areas. As a consequence, these port communities have 
expressed concern that the implementation of a program to 
increase the reliance on private industry dredges could have an 
adverse effect on navigation. To reassure these areas, the 
managers have included language directing the Secretary not to 
reduce the availability and utilization of Federal hopper 
dredge vessels on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the United 
States to meet the navigation dredging needs.

in Stillwater, Minnesota. The non-Federal sponsor has expressed 
concerns that the expansion of the project, and the need for 
the Corps to conduct an analysis of the expanded project, could 
cause a delay in implementing the previously authorized work. 
Unnecessary delay in the previously authorized work is not 
intended. The Secretary is directed to continue expeditiously 
in the implementation of the previously authorized work during

      This section modifies the project for flood control for 
West Palm Beach Canal (Canal 51) to include authority for an 
enlarged storm water retention area and additional work at 
Federal expense, in accordance with the Everglades Protection 
Project. This project is essential to the overall Everglades 
restoration project because it will allow for a greater 
availability of fresh water to one of the most degraded 
portions of the Everglades.
      In carrying out the activities authorized under this 
section, the Secretary of the Army is to work with the South 
Florida Water Management District and the Indian Trail Water 
Control District to resolve the issue of flood control in a 
financially equitable manner consistent with each agency's 
statutory authority.

Federal share which the Secretary determines is attributable to 
the use of the lock by vessels calling at Canadian ports be 
paid by the United States. Appropriate and necessary action by 
the U.S. government to pursue reimbursement from Canada is 
strongly urged. The remaining portion of the non-Federal share 
shall be paid by the Great Lakes states pursuant to an 
agreement which they enter into with each other. The repayment 
of the non-Federal project cost is to be repaid over 50 years 
or the expected life of the project, whichever is shorter.

      Senate Sec. 207, no comparable House section--House 
recedes with an amendment.
      This section, and related sections authorizing Canal 51 
and Canal 111 activities, authorizes the restoration, 
preservation, and protection of the South Florida ecosystem. 
The provision requires the Secretary, in consultation with the 
South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force (Task Force), to 
develop a comprehensive plan involving Army Corps water 
resources projects for the purpose of Everglades restoration.
      Successful collaboration among the Army, other Federal 
agencies, the State of Florida, and Indian tribes has occurred 
in recent years on this effort and is expected to continue 
after the date of enactment of this Act. To ensure successful 
implementation of the restoration effort, the Secretary is 
urged to involve the Task Force and the South Florida Water 
Management District in the development of the Comprehensive 
Plan.
      This section clarifies that the Central and Southern 
Florida Project, as authorized in Section 203 of the Flood 
Control Act of 1948 (62 Stat. 1176) must incorporate features 
to provide for the protection of water quality as a means of 
achieving the original project purpose of preservation of fish 
and wildlife resources. The Secretary is authorized to develop 
specific water quality related project features which are 
essential to Everglades restoration. In such cases, the 
provision authorizes Federal funding at a level not to exceed 
fifty percent of the overall project costs.
      This section authorizes an appropriation of $75 million 
over three fiscal years for the construction of projects 
determined by the Secretary to be critical to the restoration 
of the Everglades. The Secretary shall not expend more than $25 
million for any one project under this authority. In carrying 
out the authority provided by this section, the Secretary shall 
give priority to the following five projects or studies: (1) 
Levee 28 modifications; (2) Florida Keys carrying capacity; (3) 
melaleuca control in the Everglades Restoration Area; (4) East 
Coast Canal Divide Structures; and (5) Tamiami Trail Culverts.
      Customary and traditional uses of affected public lands, 
including access and transportation, shall continue to be 
permitted where appropriate, and in accordance with management 
plans of the respective Federal and State management agencies.
      Over the past decades, various State and local 
governments have developed land use plans within the boundaries 
of the Everglades Restoration Area. The Secretary is directed 
to take these efforts into consideration as the Comprehensive 
Plan is developed. In addition, the Legislature of the State of 
Florida has recognized the importance of the Lake Belt Area of 
Dade County for the provision of a long-term domestic supply of 
aggregates, cement, and road base material. The Secretary is 
directed to take into consideration the Lake Belt Plan and its 
objectives, as defined by the State Legislature, during 
development of the Comprehensive Plan.
      In carrying out the activities authorized by this 
section, the Secretary is directed, to the extent feasible and 
appropriate, to integrate previously authorized restoration 
activities. In doing so, the Secretary shall employ sound 
scientific principles while seeking innovative and adaptive 
methods of management.
      The Secretary has appropriately sought consensus at the 
Federal, State and local levels in developing proposed project 
modifications for Canal 51 and Canal 111. The Secretary is 
directed to continue such solicitation for comment and 
consensus among interested and affected parties before 
proceeding to the design and implementation of project 
modifications authorized in this section.
      This section clarifies that the Federal cost-sharing does 
not apply to water quality features constructed pursuant to the 
settlement agreement in United States v. South Florida Water 
Management District, No. 88-1886-Civ-Hoeveler (S.D.Fla.). 
Further, it is not intended that Federal cost-sharing apply to 
the water quality features required under the appendices of the 
settlement agreement. Nothing included in this section is meant 
to interfere with or supersede any pending or future judicial 
proceedings or agreements related to these features.
      Recognizing the comprehensive program authorized by this 
section and the substantial Federal and non-Federal financial 
commitment it authorizes, it is expected that the Secretary be 
judicious in making commitments regarding use of the 
Secretary's other environmental authorities in this area. Such 
authorities include the ``1135'' program and the new aquatic 
ecosystem restoration program established in this legislation. 
These programs are intended to address environmental 
improvement projects nationwide and should not be used to 
supplement the projects and activities authorized by this 
section.

      The conference report adds language to section 564 which 
would have the Army Corps of Engineers complete a report that 
certain of the elements authorized in that section be found to 
be technically sound, environmentally acceptable, and economic, 
as applicable. The Corps is directed to make such a 
determination expeditiously. In addition, the benefits of some 
of the work authorized in this section are historic or 
environmental in nature. Historic and environmental benefits 
associated with such projects are not susceptible to 
quantification and monetization. Consistent with the policies 
of the Corps and prior Congressional direction, historic and 
environmental projects should not be subject to the usual 
economic analysis which evaluates projects for flood control, 
navigation and the like.

Coordination
      The Conferees are aware of groundwater contamination at 
the Sierra Army Depot, migration of this contamination into the 
Honey Valley Groundwater Basin, and the impact of such 
contamination on a proposed pipeline project to transfer water 
to the Reno-Sparks Metropolitan Area. The Secretary is to 
instruct the appropriate Army Headquarters officials to meet 
with affected parties and to determine fair compensation to 
those who have, in good faith, invested in this project but 
have been damaged by this unfortunate contamination problem.
National Center for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly
      The managers on the part of the House have receded to the 
Senate on House amendment section 585, the National Center for 
Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly. That section would 
have authorized the Secretary to provide assistance for the 
center in Evanston, Illinois.
      This assistance could better be provided through the 
Director of the National Institute of Environmental Health 
Sciences than through the Secretary of the Army. The proponents 
of the center are encouraged to work with the Director to 
receive any necessary or appropriate assistance. Similarly, the 
Director is encouraged to explore ways of providing any needed 
assistance.

                                   Bud Shuster,
                                   Don Young,

                                 Managers on the Part of the House.
