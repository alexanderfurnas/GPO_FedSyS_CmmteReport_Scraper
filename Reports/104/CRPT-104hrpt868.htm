                              R E P O R T

                             together with

                            ADDITIONAL VIEWS

    Pursuant to the provisions of Rule XI, clause 1(d) of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Rules 
submits the following report on its activities during the 104th 
Congress.

    I. HISTORY, FUNCTION, AND ORGANIZATION OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES

                            A. Introduction

    Although the House of Representatives struck a dramatic new 
course in its organization, operations, and legislative 
priorities with the first turnover in party control of the 
institution in 40 years, the Rules Committee retained its 
traditional structure and function in the new House of the 
104th Congress. Its size and super-majority party ratio 
remained the same as in previous Congresses as did its central 
role and operation as the scheduling arm of the majority 
leadership on major legislation.
    The Committee has been variously described by scholars and 
Members as a ``legislative traffic cop,'' ``gatekeeper,'' 
``field commander,'' the ``Speaker's Committee,'' and the 
``dress rehearsal'' for the House floor. All of these terms 
underscore the critical part the Committee plays in the conduct 
of legislative business on the House floor. The primary 
responsibility of the Committee remains one of setting the 
terms for debate and amendments on major legislative measures 
reported from other committees. At the same time, the Rules 
Committee exercises ``original jurisdiction'' over changes in 
House Rules and the budget process.
    While the principal purpose of this report is to summarize 
the activities of the Rules Committee in the historic 104th 
Congress, a secondary purpose is to view these activities in 
the context of the evolution of the Committee since the First 
Congress, and how it operates today.

                        B. History and Function

    The history of the Rules Committee roughly parallels the 
evolution of the House over the past 208 years. The first Rules 
Committee was established as a select committee of the House on 
the second day of the First Congress, April 2, 1789, pursuant 
to the Constitutional mandate in Article I, section 5, clause 
2, that ``Each House may determine the rules of its 
proceedings. . . .'' The Select Committee on Rules initially 
reported back a set of four rules five days after its 
appointment on: (1) the duties of the Speaker, (2) decorum and 
debate, (3) the disposition of bills, and (4) the operations of 
the Committee of the Whole. Six days later, on April 13th, the 
Select Committee reported an additional eight rules dealing 
with such matters as the service of Members on committees, 
Members' attendance at floor proceedings, creation of a 
standing Committee on Elections, duties of the Clerk, and 
duties of the Sergeant-at-Arms. With the adoption by the House 
of these rules, the Select Committee was dissolved.
    During the first 90 years of the House, the Rules Committee 
remained a select committee, reporting any recommended 
revisions in the standing rules at the beginning of a Congress 
from those of the previous Congress, and then going out of 
business. In some Congresses the House did not even bother to 
appoint a Select Committee on Rules and instead simply operated 
under the rules of the preceding Congress.
    Although the House relied primarily on select committees in 
its early years to draft legislation, by the mid-nineteenth 
century this system had evolved into one consisting of 34 
standing committees. The Rules Committee was also converted 
briefly into a standing committee between 1849 and 1853 but it 
was not until the House rules revision of 1880 that the 
Committee became a permanent, standing committee of the House. 
In 1858, the Speaker had been made a member of the Select 
Committee on Rules, and a year later was designated as its 
chairman. When the Committee became a standing committee in 
1880, the Speaker retained the chairmanship, and, shortly 
thereafter, in 1883, the modern-day Rules Committee began to 
emerge when the House upheld the right of the Committee to 
issue ``special orders'' or ``rules'' providing for the 
consideration of legislation from other committees. By 1890, 
this new role became an accepted practice as the exclusive 
prerogative of the Rules Committee.
    The importance of such special rules, which were simple 
House resolutions reported from the Rules Committee, was that 
they only needed a majority vote of the House to provide for 
the consideration of bills out of the order on which they 
appeared on their Calendar, whereas previously, a two-thirds 
vote was required to suspend the rules and take up a bill out 
of order.
    The person most responsible for recognizing and exploiting 
the full potential of the combined powers of Speaker and Rules 
Committee chairman was Representative Thomas Brackett Reed of 
Maine who served in those two roles in 1889-91, and 1895-99. 
Not only did he use the authority as Speaker to make rulings 
from the Chair that outlawed certain dilatory and 
obstructionist floor tactics, but he then proceeded to enshrine 
these rulings, known as ``Reed's Rules,'' in the standing rules 
of the House in his capacity as Rules Committee chairman. And 
Reed made regular use of the Rules Committee to report special 
rules that enabled him to put the bills he wanted on the floor 
when he wanted them, and under his terms of debate and 
amendment.
    It wasn't until 1910 that this power combination was 
broken-up by a revolt against the conservative and autocratic 
Speaker Joe Cannon of Illinois who had served as Speaker and 
Rules Committee chairman since 1903. A group of progressive 
Republican insurgents joined with the Democratic minority in an 
attempt to directly amend House Rules from the floor. When 
Speaker Cannon upheld a point of order that only the Rules 
Committee could recommend changes in House Rules, the group 
voted to overturn the ruling and then proceeded to amend the 
rules to strip the Speaker of his chairmanship and membership 
on the Rules Committee as well as of his power to appoint the 
committee, and to enlarge the committee from five to 10 
members, elected by the House. The following year, the new 
Democratic majority in the House completed the revolution by 
taking away the Speaker's power to appoint all the other 
committees of the House. Ever since, all standing committees 
have been elected by the House.
    The result of this revolt was far-reaching and long-
lasting. The standing committees became independent power 
centers, no longer directly accountable to the Speaker. While 
the Rules Committee continued to serve as the scheduling arm of 
the Leadership, even it developed an independent streak of its 
own when reaction set-in against the New Deal in 1937. From 
that time until 1961, the Committee was dominated by a 
conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans 
who would sometimes refuse to report rules on bills the 
majority leadership wanted on the floor, or would only report 
such rules under their terms and timing. A successful effort by 
Speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas and President John F. Kennedy in 
1961 to enlarge the committee from 12 to 15 members, including 
two, more liberal Democrats, still did not bring the immediate 
results intended. It wasn't until the mid-seventies, with a 
large influx of new Democrats, that the Rules Committee was 
fully restored as an arm of the majority leadership.
    The reform revolt of the mid-seventies also produced 
further decentralization in the House with the emergence of 
more independent-minded Members and the proliferation of semi-
autonomous subcommittees. This decentralization soon led to 
off-setting pressures to give the majority leadership, 
particularly the Speaker, acting through the Rules Committee, 
more authority to pull things back together. In 1975, the 
Democratic Speaker was given authority under Caucus rules to 
appoint all Rules Committee Democrats, subject to Caucus 
ratification. In 1989 the Republican Conference gave the 
minority leader the same authority to appoint all Rules 
Committee Republicans. Beginning in the 1980s, a trend away 
from open rules began. Whereas in the 95th Congress (1977-78), 
85% of all special rules were open, meaning any Member could 
offer a germane floor amendment, this percentage began to 
gradually decline. By the 103rd Congress (1993-94), only 30% of 
the special rules were open, while the rest were restrictive or 
structured, meaning only amendments specified in the special 
rules could be offered. In the 104th Congress, the trend 
towards restrictive rules was suddenly reversed with open and 
modified open rules comprising 57% of all rules reported for 
the original consideration of legislation compared to 44% open 
or modified open rules in the 103rd Congress. This may explain 
in part why six rules were defeated in the 103rd Congress while 
only one was defeated in the 104th Congress.
    Ironically, the original role of the Rules Committee, 
dating back to 1789, of recommending revisions in House Rules 
at the beginning of each Congress, had disappeared by the 
beginning of this century. This function was effectively 
replaced by the majority party caucus after the 1910 overthrow 
of Speaker Cannon. In modern times, the majority party caucus 
develops a set of rules changes for consideration on the 
opening day of the new Congress, before a Rules Committee has 
even been authorized or elected. The minority party caucus also 
develops its own set of proposed rules changes at the beginning 
of each Congress, though the terms of consideration never allow 
a direct vote on the minority's alternative. It should be noted 
however, that Rules Committee members of both parties have 
usually served as members or even the chairs of their 
respective party caucus committees that recommend House Rules 
changes.
    The resolution adopting the rules of a new Congress is 
usually called up by the former chairman of the Rules Committee 
or the majority leader, debated for one hour, and given an up-
or-down vote after minority attempts to bring up its 
alternative are routinely beaten back on party-line, procedural 
votes.
    Nevertheless, the Rules Committee still retains its 
original jurisdiction authority throughout a Congress to report 
further changes in House Rules and from time-to-time exercises 
that authority to make further minor adjustments. However, 
because so much of the time of the Committee today is consumed 
with reporting special rules for the consideration of bills 
from other committees, the work on most major rules reform 
efforts is often delegated to specially-created committees. For 
example, the landmark Legislative Reorganization Acts of 1946 
and 1970, and the 1974 Budget Act were the products of joint, 
House-Senate panels, though in the latter two instances the 
Rules Committee further amended the recommendations of the 
joint panels before reporting them to the House floor. In 1992, 
the House and Senate created another Joint Committee on the 
Organization of Congress, but its recommendations at the end of 
1993 languished in the Rules Committee for a year and were 
never reported to the House by the end of the 103rd Congress.
    The 1974 Committee Reform Amendments were the product of a 
bipartisan, House Select Committee on Committees. While it was 
authorized to report directly to the House, the rule providing 
for its consideration made in order a Democratic Caucus 
substitute that eventually prevailed after several amendments 
were adopted to it by the House. The 1989 Ethics Reform Act, on 
the other hand, while also the product of a bipartisan, House 
leadership task force, was reported to the House under a closed 
rule, without alteration.

          C. Committee Organization During the 104th Congress

    At the beginning of the 94th Congress, the Committee 
membership was increased from fifteen members (ten Democrats 
and five Republicans) to sixteen members (eleven Democrats and 
five Republicans). This ratio was retained until the 98th 
Congress, when the membership was reduced to thirteen members, 
nine Democrats and four Republicans. The membership remained at 
thirteen, through the 104th Congress. The ratio of majority 
party members to minority party members also remained the same 
in the 104th Congress, except that for the first time in 40 
years, Republicans were in the majority.
    Eight members of the Rules Committee in the 104th Congress 
served on the Committee during the previous Congress. The 
returning Republican Representatives were Gerald B.H. Solomon 
of New York, the new Chairman of the Committee, James H. 
Quillen of Tennessee, David Dreier of California and Porter 
Goss of Florida. The returning Democratic Representatives were 
John Joseph Moakley of Massachusetts, Anthony C. Beilenson of 
California, Martin Frost of Texas and Tony P. Hall of Ohio. New 
Republican members of the Committee were John Linder of 
Georgia, Deborah Pryce of Ohio, Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida, 
Scott McInnis of Colorado and Enid Greene Waldholtz of Utah. 
Because of the change in party control, former Democratic 
members of the Rules Committee not on the committee in the 
104th Congress were David E. Bonior of Michigan (who took a 
leave of absence), Bart Gordon of Tennessee, and Louise M. 
Slaughter of New York. Democrat Alan Wheat of Missouri left the 
Committee to run for the U.S. Senate and was defeated in that 
race.
    The Committee held its organizational meeting on January 5, 
1995. Representative James H. Quillen of Tennessee, who has the 
distinction of being the longest serving Republican member of 
the Rules Committee in its entire history (thirty two years of 
Committee service by the end of the 104th Congress when he 
announced his retirement) opened the meeting and presented the 
new Chairman of the Committee, Gerald B.H. Solomon of New York. 
Chairman Solomon then designated James H. Quillen as the 
Chairman Emeritus of the Rules Committee. Chairman Solomon 
introduced the new members of the Rules Committee, 
Representatives Linder, Pryce, Diaz-Balart, McInnis and Greene 
Waldholtz.
    Rep. Dreier offered a motion that the Committee rules that 
were in effect during the 103rd Congress be adopted as the 
rules of the Committee for the 104th Congress with seven 
amendments. The seven amendments were as follows: (1) eliminate 
a redundant consultation requirement with the minority; (2) 
permit the Chair to designate any member of the majority party 
on the committee as the vice chair; (3) require that all 
rollcall votes in the Committee on amendments and motions to 
report be included in the Committee report; (4) afford the 
audio and visual media the same access to Committee proceedings 
as the public; (5) require the Committee to adopt an oversight 
agenda for a Congress and to report on its implementation at 
the end of a Congress; (6) consolidate all staff funding under 
a single expense resolution and provide new authority of the 
Chairman and Ranking Minority Member over associate staff and 
subcommittee staff; and (7) require that Committee transcripts 
be a substantially verbatim account of proceedings.
    Representative Dreier also offered a motion that pursuant 
to Rule 4 (d), the Subcommittee on Rules of the House and the 
Subcommittee on the Legislative Process, would each be composed 
of five majority and two minority members, identical to the 
ratio of the 103rd Congress. Both of Representative Dreier's 
motions were adopted by a voice vote.
    Chairman Solomon subsequently appointed David Dreier as 
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rules of the House and 
appointed Porter Goss to chair the Subcommittee on the 
Legislative Process. Chairman Solomon then appointed the 
majority and minority members of the two subcommittees as 
follows.
    Subcommittee on Rules of the House: David Dreier 
(Chairman), Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Scott McInnis, Enid Greene 
Waldholtz, Gerald B.H. Solomon, Anthony C. Beilenson and Tony 
P. Hall.
    Subcommittee on the Legislative Process: Porter Goss 
(Chairman), James H. Quillen, John Linder, Deborah Pryce, 
Gerald B.H. Solomon, Martin Frost, and John Joseph Moakley.
    Chairman Solomon designated David Dreier as Vice Chairman 
of the Rules Committee. He designated Lincoln Diaz-Balart as 
Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rules of the House and 
James H. Quillen as Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on the 
Legislative Process.
    At a subsequent meeting on February 8, 1995, the Rules 
Committee adopted the Committee budget and authorized Chairman 
Solomon to introduce a funding resolution.

                 D. The Rules Committee on the Internet

    The Rules Committee's Internet Web page, http://
www.house.gov/rules/, went online June 20, 1996. From the first 
page the viewer is greeted by a banner, a picture of Chairman 
Solomon, and six related links; ``Members, Coming Attractions, 
Rules News You Can Use, Subcommittees, Committee History, and 
Links.'' The intent is to create a series of pages that are 
easy to read and pleasing to the eye. Though that may be 
somewhat subjective, the ``less is more'' approach is taken 
when the ever evolving text and graphical content are 
discussed.
    The ``Coming Attractions'' link will keep interested 
parties, both on and off the Hill, apprised of the Rules 
Committee's scheduled hearings and markups. Though proposed 
legislation sometimes comes to the committee at a moment's 
notice, every effort will be made to make sure that this link 
remains current and useful.
    Following close on the heels of the schedule link is the 
``Rules News You Can Use'' site. Rather than have a simple 
repository for parliamentary rules-speak, this link will 
contain all information relevant to the Rules Committee's role 
in the legislative process. As institutional barriers to the 
production and retrieval of electronic documents are removed, 
this will be the link to follow in order to find: prepared 
statements, committee rules, oversight plans, activity reports, 
committee reports, and prints of bills.
    The next link from the home page is the 
``Subcommittees.'' http://www.house.gov/rules__org/21home.html, 
is the address of the first Rules Committee related web-site, 
and is maintained by the Subcommittee on Rules and Organization 
of the House. Entitled ``The Twenty-First Century Congress,'' 
the original page was designed to facilitate interactive 
communication between Congress and the public, as well as to 
explore how technology will transform the way Congress works. 
Since its inception, the page has been accessed many times as 
people take the time to fill out the survey within the page. 
Currently, the subcommittee is planning a complete overhaul of 
the page which should be ready by the beginning of the 105th 
Congress. The intent is to create a massive research tool to 
show how the Congress operates, while maintaining an 
interactive communication format. These are two goals which 
will surely help in bringing Congress into the digital age.
    The Subcommittee on the Legislative and Budget Process web 
site is located at http://www.house.gov/rules__bud/homenew.htm. 
The subcommittee is charged with monitoring the legislative 
process and reviewing the budget process--two operations which 
are difficult to comprehend. The web site is designed to give 
people an easy map to follow in understanding how the rules and 
procedures of the House direct what is done in managing the 
nation's business.
    The ``Rules Committee History'' link is complete with two 
articles from the Simon and Schuster publication, 
``Encyclopedia of the United States Congress.'' ``Rules 
Committee--In the Beginning . . . '' is a brief synopsis of the 
origins and evolution of the committee through the years. 
``What is a Special Rule?'' defines the type of rule the 
committee recommends to govern debate of legislation on the 
House floor.
    The final stop on the committee's page suggests links to 
other related web sites, the first of which is a link to the 
THOMAS web site. Unveiled on January 5, 1995 by the House 
Leadership and the Library of Congress, THOMAS is the first 
ever electronic information base to distribute information 
about the House and Senate to the public free of charge. The 
second is a link to ``Federal Government Links.'' The site is 
maintained and constantly updated by House Information 
Resources. Therein one may find numerous links to the 
executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government, as 
well as links to ``Federal Information Exchange, Inc.,'' 
``FedWorld,'' and ``Federal Information Center (FIC).''
    At the beginning of the 104th Congress there were very few 
E-mail addresses for members of Congress and no committee Web 
sites. The House of Representatives processed virtually all 
legislative information through paper-based systems. Use of 
paper and ink as a method of communication was so entrenched 
that the electronic files were actually discarded once the 
paper documents were created. Each standing committee has now 
been allocated disk space on the Web server maintained by the 
House for the purpose of providing access to Congressional 
information.
    At the close of the 104th Congress, five of the committee's 
thirteen members had individual home pages. Member web sites 
are especially useful in finding out how to contact the office, 
to research sponsored legislation, or gather information on 
constituent services. All thirteen members should have a home 
page by the beginning of the 105th Congress.
    While the Internet offers almost limitless possibilities 
for the free communication of ideas, research and information, 
there are serious business and consumer issues concerning 
accessibility, cost, privacy, security, copyright, and 
standardization. From a government perspective, free access to 
Congressional documents would allow millions of citizens to 
become government watchdogs. This would represent a significant 
bridging of the gap between Hill insider and outsider, and the 
leap in citizen involvement could be considerable. However, the 
business of Congress, like any business, involves informal 
discussions surrounding documents that are amended and changed 
many times before official approval by a committee, 
subcommittee, or the House. Though there is an aggressive move 
to establish an infrastructure capable of supporting a timely, 
public distribution of official documents, a careful analysis 
into the ramifications of the release of draft and unofficial 
documents is needed.
    As the foundation of common electronic and computable 
systems continues to grow, so will the Rules Committee's web 
site. As David Mason, Vice President of Government Relations 
for the Heritage Foundation said in a hearing before the two 
subcommittees of the Rules Committee, on July 24, 1996. ``There 
are three clear principles you [the Congress] have already made 
. . . the second of which is an increase in public access to 
congressional information especially through the Internet.'' In 
an effort to improve citizen participation in government, 
Congress is taking its first steps into a digital age.

Any such report shall contain all matters required by the Rules 
of the House of Representatives (or by any provision of law

 II. HOUSE RULES CHANGES ADOPTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 104TH CONGRESS

                            A. Introduction

    The change from Democratic to Republican party control of 
the Congress with the 1994 congressional elections not only 
portended new legislative policy directions for the country, 
but fundamental changes in the internal operations of the 
Congress itself, especially in the House. Central to House 
congressional races was the ``Contract With America,'' a 
detailed party legislative and congressional reform agenda for 
the 104th Congress that was unveiled in September of 1994 in a 
ceremony on the Capitol steps attended by most House Republican 
candidates.
    In its opening paragraph, the Contract promised not only to 
change policies, but ``to restore the bonds of trust between 
the people and their elected representatives.'' The Contract 
went on to promise to ``transform the way the House works,'' 
and ``to restore accountability to Congress.'' To this end, the 
Contract pledged that, ``On the first day of the 104th 
Congress, the new Republican majority will immediately pass the 
following major reforms, aimed at restoring the faith and trust 
of the American people in their government:
          ``First, require all laws that apply to the rest of 
        the country also apply equally to the Congress;
          ``Second, select a major, independent auditing firm 
        to conduct a comprehensive audit of Congress for waste, 
        fraud, or abuse;
          ``Third, cut the number of House committees, and cut 
        committee staff by one-third;
          ``Fourth, limit the terms of all committee chairs;
          ``Fifth, ban the casting of proxy votes in 
        committees;
          ``Sixth, require committee meetings to be open to the 
        public;
          ``Seventh, require a three-fifths majority vote to 
        pass a tax increase;
          ``Eighth, guarantee an honest accounting of our 
        Federal Budget by implementing zero baseline 
        budgeting.''
    Following the election, two Rules Committee Republicans, 
Ranking Minority Member Gerald B.H. Solomon (NY) and David 
Dreier (CA), were charged with drafting these and other reform 
proposals for consideration by the Leadership and the 
Republican Conference.
    Both Members had also served as members of the Joint 
Committee on the Organization of the Congress in the 103rd 
Congress, and they therefore had the advantage of drawing from 
many of the proposals that had either been adopted as part of 
the House portion of the Joint Committee's recommendations or 
had been offered as amendments to it and rejected. Many of the 
recommendations finally included in the House Rules package for 
the 104th Congress had their antecedents in Republican House 
Rules substitutes offered on the opening days of preceding 
Congresses.
    The preliminary draft of the proposed rules for the 104th 
Congress was presented to the Republican Conference at its 
organizational meetings in December of 1994. Further proposals 
were offered by Members of the Conference, including the new 
class of 73 freshmen Members, and these were given further 
consideration by the Leadership and included in the final 
resolution drafted for consideration on opening day.

 B. Procedures for Consideration of the House Rules Resolution for the 
                             104th Congress

    As was discussed in section one, the ordinary process for 
considering the rules of a new Congress was for the former 
chairman (in this case, the former ranking minority member) of 
the Rules Committee or the majority leader, to call up the 
resolution adopting the rules of the new Congress for 
consideration under the ``hour rule.'' That means that, after 
one hour of debate, if the previous question is adopted, the 
House proceeds to vote the entire package of rules changes up 
or down. The minority has two opportunities to amend the 
package: (1) if it defeats the previous question, in which case 
it would be recognized for an additional hour to offer its 
amendments: or (2) if it succeeds in moving to commit the 
package to a specified select committee with instructions to 
report back ``forthwith'' with certain amendments. However, as 
previously discussed, these procedural votes usually occur 
along strict party lines.
    However, for the first time in a century, the new majority 
leadership decided upon a different procedure in order to 
highlight the important changes contained in the Contract by 
permitting a separate debate and vote on each of them. To 
achieve this result, it was necessary first for a special rule 
or order of business resolution to be presented to the House.
    Consequently, on January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 
104th Congress, after the House had adopted H. Res. 4 informing 
the President of the election of the Speaker and Clerk of the 
House, the majority leader first propounded this special 
procedure as a unanimous consent request. When it was objected 
to by the minority, Rules Committee chairman designate Solomon, 
by direction of the Republican Conference, called up H. Res. 5 
as a privileged resolution. The resolution provided that upon 
adoption of H. Res. 5 it would be in order to call-up the 
resolution adopting the rules of the House for the 104th 
Congress. The resolution would first be debated for 30 minutes, 
equally divided between the majority and minority leaders or 
their designees. The resolution next provided for a division of 
the question on the rules resolution into nine parts, the first 
eight parts being the Contract's House reform provisions, and 
the ninth part being an additional 23 rules changes, with each 
of the nine parts debatable for 20 minutes. Finally, the 
resolution provided for one motion to commit the resolution 
with or without instructions.
    After the previous question on H. Res. 5 was adopted, 232 
to 199, the minority offered a motion to commit H. Res. 5 to a 
select committee consisting of the majority and minority 
leaders with instructions to report back an amendment that 
would self-execute the adoption of an amendment to H. Res. 6 to 
restrict the acceptance of gifts and book royalties by Members, 
officers and employees of the House. The motion to commit was 
rejected, 196 to 235, and H. Res. 5 was then adopted, 251 to 
181. The majority leader then called up H. Res. 6, adopting 
House Rules for the 104th Congress, and the House proceeded to 
debate and vote on its nine component parts.
    Since H. Res. 5 had established a division of the question 
voting process, there would be no vote on final adoption of the 
resolution. Each of the nine parts stood as an individual 
proposition, not dependent on any of the others, and therefore 
could be rejected without bringing down the entire package. 
However, most of the propositions enjoyed large, bipartisan 
majority votes. For example: the provision cutting committee 
staffs by one-third was adopted, 416 to 12; the term limits on 
committee and subcommittee chairmen and the Speaker was 
adopted, 355 to 74; the proxy voting ban was adopted, 418 to 
13; committee sunshine rules, 431 to 0; and the House audit, 
430 to 1. The only provisions that were contentious were the 
three-fifths vote requirement for income tax rate increases, 
which was adopted, 279 to 152, and section 8 of Title I, which 
provided for consideration of the Congressional Accountability 
Act, which was adopted, 249 to 178.
    The final of the nine votes was on the 23 additional rules 
changes in Title II. On this the minority offered its motion to 
commit with instructions containing additional amendments. The 
motion was rejected, 201 to 227. Subsequently, Title II was 
adopted by voice vote.
    The House then proceeded to debate and vote on H.R. 1, the 
Congressional Accountability Act, under the terms of section 8 
of Title I of H. Res. 6 which provided for one-hour of 
consideration in the House (meaning no amendments unless 
contained in a motion to recommit with instructions). The bill 
was passed by a vote of 429 to 0. The first day of the 104th 
Congress, which had begun at 12 noon on January 4, 1995, was 
finally adjourned after a marathon 14-plus hours at 2:24 a.m. 
on January 5th.

  C. Summary of Provisions of H. Res. 6, Adopting House Rules For The 
                             104th Congress

    Below is a section-by-section summary of H. Res. 6, 
entitled, ``A Contract for a New House,'' adopting House Rules 
for the 104th Congress, as offered by Majority Leader Armey on 
January 4, 1995.
     The Rules of the House of the 103rd Congress are adopted 
as the rules for the 104th Congress together with the following 
amendment:

        Title I. Contract with America: A Bill of Accountability

    Sec. 101. Committee, Subcommittee and Staff Reforms: 
Committee staff in the 104th Congress is reduced by at least 
one-third from comparable levels in the 103rd Congress. No 
committee could have more than 5 subcommittees (except 
Appropriations which could have no more than 13; Government 
Reform and Oversight, no more than 7; and Transportation and 
Infrastructure, no more than 6). Statutory and investigative 
staff salary authorization levels would be consolidated in a 
single, 2-year committee expense resolution (except for the 
Committee on Appropriations). The distinction between 
professional and clerical staff would be eliminated while 
retaining the overall core staff of 30 for each committee (20-
majority, 10-minority, or a one-third guarantee to the minority 
if less than 30). Committee chairmen would be required to 
ensure that sufficient staff is made available to each 
subcommittee to exercise its responsibilities under committee 
rules, including fair treatment to the minority in subcommittee 
staffing. Interim funding authority for House committees, 
consistent with planned staff reductions, would be provided 
pending the adoption of the primary expense resolution for 
1995-96.
    Sec. 102. Truth-in-Budgeting Baseline Reform: Cost 
estimates in committee reports would include a comparison of 
total estimated funding for the program(s) to the appropriate 
levels under current law.
    Sec. 103. Term Limits for Speaker, Committee and 
Subcommittee Chairmen: Beginning with the 104th Congress: (a) 
No person could serve as Speaker for more than four consecutive 
Congresses (disregarding any service for less than a session). 
(b) No Member could be the chairman of any committee, or of the 
same subcommittee of a committee, for more than three 
consecutive Congresses (excluding any service for less than a 
session in a Congress).
    Sec. 104. Proxy Voting Ban: No vote could be cast by proxy 
on any committee or subcommittee thereof.
    Sec. 105. Committee Sunshine Rules: Committee meetings, 
which can now be closed for any reason, could only be closed by 
majority rollcall vote if disclosure would endanger national 
security, compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or 
tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person. Broadcast 
coverage of any committee or subcommittee meeting or hearing 
open to the public would be a right (not requiring a vote of 
approval as at present).
    Sec. 106. Limitations on Tax Increases: (a) No bill, joint 
resolution, amendment or conference report carrying an income 
tax rate increase, could be considered as passed or agreed to 
unless so determined by a vote of at least three-fifths of the 
House. (b) No measure or amendment could be considered that 
contains a retroactive income tax rate increase.
    Sec. 107. Comprehensive House Audit: The Inspector General 
would be authorized to contract with one or more independent 
auditing firms to conduct a comprehensive audit of House 
financial records, physical assets, and operational facilities.
    Sec. 108. Consideration of ``Congressional Accountability 
Act'': The majority leader, or a designee, would be authorized 
to call up for consideration on Jan. 4, 1995, a bill (H.R. 1), 
the ``Congressional Accountability Act of 1995,'' subject to 
one-hour of debate in the House, divided equally between the 
majority leader and minority leader, or their designees, and to 
one motion to recommit.

                           Title II. General

    Sec. 201. House Administrative Reforms: The Office of 
Doorkeeper would be abolished and its functions transferred to 
the Sergeant-at-Arms. A Chief Administrative Officer, elected 
by the House, would replace the Director of Financial and Non-
Legislative Services. The authority of the Inspector General 
would be broadened to audit all House functions and to refer 
possible violations of rules or law to the ethics committee for 
action or possible referral to the appropriate Federal or State 
authorities.
    Sec. 202. Changes in Committee System: The Committees on 
Post Office and Civil Service, and the District of Columbia 
would be abolished and their jurisdictions transferred to the 
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight; the Committee on 
Merchant Marine and Fisheries would be abolished and its 
jurisdiction transferred to the committees on National 
Security, Resources, and Transportation and Infrastructure. The 
Committee on Budget would be given shared legislative 
jurisdiction over certain budgetary legislation. Term limits 
for members of the Budget Committee would be changed from 
three-terms in any five Congresses to four-terms in any six 
Congresses. Other committees would be renamed and jurisdictions 
transferred.
    Sec. 203. Oversight Reform: Committees would be required to 
adopt oversight plans for the Congress and submit them to the 
Committees on House Oversight and Government Reform and 
Oversight by Feb. 15th of the first session. The Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight would report the plans to the 
House by March 31st together with any recommendations of the 
committee or joint leadership to ensure maximum coordination. 
Committees would be required to include an oversight section in 
their final activity reports reporting on the implementation of 
their plans. The Speaker would be authorized to appoint ad hoc 
oversight committees, subject to House approval, for specific 
oversight projects from committees sharing jurisdiction.
    Sec. 204. Member Assignment Limits: No Member could have 
more than two standing committee and four subcommittee 
assignments (except committee chairmen and ranking minority 
members could serve as ex officio members of all subcommittees 
of their committees). Any exception to the assignment limits 
must be approved by the House upon the recommendation of the 
respective party caucus or conference.
    Sec. 205. Multiple Bill Referral Reform: The joint referral 
of bills to two or more committees would be prohibited. The 
Speaker would designate a committee of primary jurisdiction 
when a bill is introduced, may refer parts of bills to 
appropriate committees, and may sequentially refer bills, 
either upon introduction or after the primary committee has 
reported, subject to time limits for reporting.
    Sec. 206. Accuracy of Committee Transcripts: Committee 
hearing and meeting transcripts shall be a substantially 
verbatim account of remarks made during proceedings, subject 
only to technical, grammatical, and typographical corrections 
authorized by the person making the remarks involved.
    Sec. 207. Elimination of ``Rolling Quorums'': The existing 
``rolling quorum'' rule which allows drop-by voting to report 
measures and permits less than a quorum to report if no point 
of order is raised, would be repealed.
    Sec. 208. Prohibition on Committee Meetings During House 
Consideration of Amendments: No committee (except the 
Committees on Appropriations, Rules, Standards and Ways and 
Means) could sit while the House is reading a measure for 
amendment under the five-minute rule without special leave 
(which shall be granted unless 10 members object), or unless 
upon the adoption of a motion offered by the majority leader 
which shall be privileged. No committee could sit while the 
House and Senate are meeting in joint session or when a joint 
meeting of the House and Senate is in progress.
    Sec. 209. Accountability for Committee Votes: Committee 
reports on any bill or other matter would include the names of 
those voting for and against on rollcall votes on any 
amendments or on the motion to report a measure.
    Sec. 210. Affirming Minority's Right on Motions To 
Recommit:  The Rules Committee could not report a special rule 
denying the minority the right to offer amendatory instructions 
in a motion to recommit if offered by the minority leader or a 
designee.
    Sec. 211. Waiver Policy for Special Rules: The Committee on 
Rules would be required, to the maximum extent possible, to 
specify in any special rule providing for the consideration of 
a measure any provisions of House rules being waived.
    Sec. 212. Prohibition on Delegate Voting in Committee of 
Whole:  The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico and the 
Delegates from Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the 
District of Columbia could not vote in or preside over the 
Committee of the Whole.
    Sec. 213. Accuracy of the Congressional Record: The 
Congressional Record would be a verbatim account of 
proceedings, subject only to technical, grammatical and 
typographical corrections by the Member speaking. 
Unparliamentary remarks may be deleted only by unanimous 
consent or order of the House.
    Sec. 214. Automatic Roll Call Votes: Automatic roll call 
votes would be required on final passage of bills making 
appropriations, raising taxes, and conference reports thereon; 
and on final adoption of budget resolutions and their 
conference reports.
    Sec. 215. Appropriations Reforms: Limitation amendments 
could be offered to appropriations bills at the end of the 
regular amendment process without having to first defeat the 
motion to rise and report. A motion to rise could only be 
offered by the majority leader (or a designee) if limitation 
amendments are still pending. Non-emergency items could not be 
reported or offered as amendments to emergency spending bills 
(except to rescind budget authority or reduce direct spending 
to pay for the emergency benefits). Off-setting, deficit 
neutral amendments could be offered en bloc to any 
appropriations measure. Reports on all appropriations bills 
would be required to include not only a listing of legislative 
provisions contained in the measures (as presently required), 
but of all unauthorized activities being funded by the measure 
(except for classified intelligence or national security 
programs). Points of order would automatically be reserved 
against an appropriations bill when filed.
    Sec. 216. Ban on Commemoratives: No bill, resolution or 
amendment could be introduced or considered in the House that 
establishes or expresses any commemoration (defined as any 
remembrance, celebration or recognition for any purpose) for a 
specified time period (e.g., day, week, month). The Committee 
on Government Reform and Oversight would be directed to 
consider alternative means of establishing commemorations, such 
as an independent or Executive Branch Commission, and to report 
to the House any recommendations.
    Sec. 217. Numerical Designation of Amendments Submitted for 
Record: Amendments submitted for the amendments section of the 
Congressional Record for any bill would be given numerical 
designations in the order printed for that bill to facilitate 
easy reference by Members and committees.
    Sec. 218. Pledge of Allegiance: The Pledge of Allegiance 
would be required in the House as the third order of business 
each day.
    Sec. 219. Discharge Petitions: The Clerk would be required 
to publish the names of new signers of discharge petitions in 
the last Congressional Record of each week and make available 
to the public through an appropriate office the current names 
of signers on a daily basis. The Clerk shall also devise a 
system for making the names of signers available to House 
offices and the public through electronic form.
    Sec. 220. Protection of Classified Materials: The Code of 
Official Conduct would be amended to require that, prior to 
having access to any classified materials, Members, officers 
and employees take an oath not to disclose such materials 
except as authorized by the House or its Rules.
    Sec. 221. Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence: The 
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence would be 
reduced in size from 19 to 16 members, with a 9-7 majority to 
minority ratio. Member terms would be increased from three to 
four and the chairman and ranking minority member could serve a 
fifth term if they held those positions for only one Congress. 
The Speaker (currently the majority leader) and minority leader 
would serve as ex officio, non-voting members, and may 
designate a member of their leadership staff to assist them and 
have access to committee proceedings and materials, as if 
committee staff, subject to the same security clearance and 
confidentiality requirements as committee staff. Current 
jurisdictional arrangements would be clarified.
    Sec. 222. Abolition of Legislative Service Organizations: 
The establishment or continuation of any Legislative Service 
Organization (as defined and authorized by regulation in the 
103rd Congress) would be prohibited in the 104th Congress. The 
Committee on House Oversight would be directed to take 
necessary steps to ensure the orderly termination and 
accounting for funds of LSOs in existence on Jan. 4, 1995.
    Sec. 223. Miscellaneous Provisions and Clerical 
Corrections: The Speaker's authority to postpone votes on 
certain matters would include postponing the previous question 
vote on those matters. The Speaker's authority to reduce time 
for voting to 5 minutes after a 15-minute vote on the previous 
question would extend to any previous question vote (currently 
applies only to previous question vote on special rules from 
the Rules Committee). There would be established a Speaker's 
Office for Legislative Floor Activities, with employees to be 
appointed by the Speaker to assist in the management of 
legislative floor activity. The Chairman of a committee could 
designate any member of the committee or a subcommittee as the 
vice chairman of the committee or subcommittee. Members would 
be prohibited from using any personal, electronic office 
equipment (including cellular phones, and laptop computers) on 
the House floor. Certain specified, priority measures 
introduced on Jan. 4, 1995, could have more than one prime 
sponsor.

               III. COMMITTEE JURISDICTION AND ACTIVITIES

                            A. Introduction

    The jurisdictional mandate of the Committee on Rules is set 
forth in Rule X, clause 1(m) as follows:
          ``(m) Committee on Rules.
                  ``(1) The rules and joint rules (other than 
                rules or joint rules relating to the Code of 
                Official Conduct), and order of business of the 
                House.
                  ``(2) Recesses and final adjournments of 
                Congress.
        The Committee on Rules is authorized to sit and act 
        whether or not the House is in session.''
    The jurisdictional mandate of the Committee for the 
purposes of this survey of activities is broken down into two 
subgroups: original jurisdiction matters and special rules 
(order of business resolutions). In practice, these subgroups 
are intertwined in a manner that greatly affects the way in 
which the House conducts its business. One subgroup, referred 
to here as ``original jurisdiction'' contains all measures 
pertaining to the rules of the House and joint rules. These 
measures are either referred directly to the Committee by the 
Speaker or originate in the Committee itself. They not only 
pertain to changes in House procedure, but also cover the 
Committee's power to establish select committees, authorize 
certain investigations, provide enforcement procedures for the 
budget process, and to establish congressional procedures for 
considering certain executive branch proposals.
    The Committee held sixteen days of hearings and markups on 
eleven matters of original jurisdiction during the 104th 
Congress. Ten of the eleven measures were reported to the House 
for consideration. Nine of those were adopted by the House. One 
of the original eleven was not reported by the Rules Committee 
but was discharged by the adoption of a rule and was then 
adopted by the House.
    The other subgroup of the Committee's jurisdictional 
mandate, referred to as order of business resolutions or 
``rules,'' is used by the Committee to direct the manner in 
which a bill or resolution will be considered by the House. 
``Rules,'' in the form of House resolutions, tailor the time 
allotted for debate and the process by which a bill can be 
amended. This is done to allow the House to consider the 
subject matter in a way which best suits the bill's individual 
issues and/or controversies. These ``rules'' may also contain 
waivers of specific House rules or provisions of the Budget 
Act. It is sometimes necessary to waive the rules of the House 
in order to allow the House to consider all the facets of the 
particular issue. Special rules also allow the House to 
consider measures according to the majority leadership's 
legislative scheduling priorities rather than in the numerical 
order in which they were reported.
    During the 104th Congress, the Committee held 190 days of 
hearings pursuant to 185 written requests received from 
Committee chairs seeking rules. In addition there were nine 
formal requests ultimately disposed of by procedures other than 
the Rules Committee (such as unanimous consent or suspension), 
and seven formal requests pending at the end of the Congress. 
These formal requests do not reflect additional requests of an 
emergency nature made in person by the chairs of the various 
legislative committees. The Rules Committee granted 230 rules: 
167 rules provided for consideration of bills and resolutions, 
49 dealt with conference reports and 19 other rules provided 
for consideration of measures but stopped short of the amending 
process (e.g., providing for debate only, creating suspension 
days for considering specific measures or waiving the two-
thirds requirement to bring up a rule for a certain measure on 
the same day the rule is reported). Note that five rules, H. 
Res. 249, H. Res. 267, H. Res. 280, H. Res. 291 and H. Res. 386 
were dual purpose rules listed under two categories above.
    The Committee granted 69 open rules, 9 modified open rules 
with a time cap on consideration of amendments, 3 modified open 
rules with required preprinting in the Congressional Record, 5 
modified open rules with both a time cap on consideration of 
amendments and required preprinting in the Congressional 
Record, 43 structured or modified closed rules, and 22 closed 
rules. The Committee granted 50 waivers of specific sections of 
the Budget Act. The Committee granted 100 rules waiving all 
points of order to permit consideration of either the 
underlying measure, the matter made in order as the original 
text, or against the amendments made in order.
    In summary, the Committee on Rules reported 230 rules (a 
19% increase over the 103rd Congress). Of these the House 
adopted 215, rejected one, tabled 12, and two remained pending 
on the House Calendar when Congress adjourned in October, 1996. 
In addition, the Committee on Rules reported 10 original 
jurisdiction measures, nine of which were ultimately adopted by 
the House. One reported measure was never taken up by the 
House. One additional original jurisdiction measure was 
discharged from the Rules Committee by adoption of a rule and 
was then adopted by the House.
    In addition to the full Committee activities, the 
Subcommittee on the Legislative and Budget Process and the 
Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House, conducted 
studies concerning other matters in the Committee's 
jurisdiction.

                       B. Special Orders or Rules

                            1. RULE REQUESTS

    The process of considering requests for special orders or 
``rules'' usually begins when the Committee on Rules receives a 
letter from a legislative committee requesting that it hold a 
hearing and recommend a rule on that particular measure. The 
letter is signed by the full committee chairman and most often 
makes a specific request for the type of rule desired by the 
legislative committee. In some cases, the emergency nature of 
the legislation does not allow adequate time for a formal 
request to be registered. In these cases, the requests are made 
in person by the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction. 
Once a hearing has been scheduled, the Committee on Rules 
allows any House member who has an interest in testifying to do 
so. Under normal circumstances and pursuant to Committee rules, 
printed copies of the legislation and accompanying committee 
report or conference report are provided to the Committee 
members at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting on the rule 
request for the legislation.
    The Committee gives written notice to its members and 
notifies the pertinent committee of the scheduled hearing date 
at least 48 hours prior to the commencement of the hearing, 
unless an emergency situation exists. Materials are also 
supplied to the Budget Committee for its examination for 
possible Budget Act violations. If Budget Act violations are 
present, the Budget Committee chairman often advises the 
Committee on Rules whether the Budget Committee objects to or 
supports the granting of specific waivers. The position of the 
Budget Committee on these matters is merely advisory in nature; 
the Committee on Rules has sole jurisdiction over waivers of 
the Budget Act, subject to House approval of the rule 
containing such waivers.

                              2. HEARINGS

    The Rules Committee chairman controls the order in which 
witnesses appear and also initiates the questioning. Typically, 
the chairman of the committee requesting the rule makes a short 
statement. The chairman is followed by the ranking minority 
member. Sometimes the subcommittee chair and ranking minority 
member appear on behalf of their full committee counterparts on 
the rule request.
    In many cases, the components of the proposed special order 
form the basis for the dialogue between substantive committee 
leaders asking for the rule and the Rules Committee members. 
More often than not, the questioning escalates into discussions 
about the merits of the bill itself. If the legislation is 
particularly wide-ranging or controversial, Representatives who 
do not sit on the relevant legislative committee seek to 
testify. (Except in the most unusual circumstances, only House 
Members are allowed to testify during a rule request hearing.) 
Questioning of each witness takes place under the five-minute 
rule until each Committee member has had an opportunity to 
question each witness. Questioning is rather informal. The 
Chairman rarely enforces the five-minute rule, and Committee 
members yield to one another to allow their colleagues to make 
a specific point or follow up on the line of questioning.
    A quorum, at least seven members of the thirteen, must be 
present before a recommendation on a rule can be ordered 
reported, deferred, or tabled (killed).
    After the Committee votes to approve a rule, the Chairman 
and ranking minority member each assign one of their members to 
manage the rule on the floor. The majority manager's name 
appears on the rule and report, and that person usually files 
the rule from the House floor, at which time the resolution and 
report are assigned a number.
    Any member may ask for a roll call or a division vote. In 
the past, most decisions of the Committee were made by voice 
vote, but in the last several Congresses there has been an 
increase in the number of roll call votes demanded. For the 
entire 100th Congress, there were 18 roll call votes demanded; 
in the 101st Congress, there were 26; in the 102nd, there were 
193; in the 103rd, there were 533; and, in the 104th, there 
were 327.
    Once a special rule has been filed, the Majority Leader--
working closely with the Speaker, the Rules Committee chairman, 
and the substantive committee chairman--decides upon an 
appropriate date for the consideration of the rule on the 
floor. Rules can be considered the same day they are reported, 
if the House agrees to consideration by a two-thirds vote. 
After a one-day layover, rules may be considered at any time 
without being subject to a question of consideration.

                  3. TYPES OF SPECIAL ORDERS OR RULES

a. Background

    Table 1 in the Appendix categorizes all rules granted. 
Rules are broken down into seventeen different categories 
dealing with all stages of the legislative process in the 
House.
    In recent congresses, particular attention has been focused 
on the type of amendment structure provided for in rules. In 
dealing with amendment structure this report focuses only on 
those rules which provide for the initial consideration of 
bills, joint resolutions or budget resolutions and which 
provide for an amending process. The new majority in the 104th 
Congress has used categories of rules which are based on the 
ones used for years by the then-minority. The amendment 
structure categories are as follows: (1) open, (2) modified 
open--time cap on consideration of amendments, (3) modified 
open--required preprinting in the Congressional Record, (4) 
modified open--both time cap on consideration of amendments and 
required preprinting in the Congressional Record, (5) 
structured or modified closed, and (6) closed.
    These categories are somewhat different from the categories 
used by the previous majority in the Survey of Activities for 
the 103rd Congress. Those categories were (1) open, (2) open 
plus, (3) open--restricted in part, (4) time cap, (5) 
amendments printed in the Congressional Record, (6) amendments 
printed in the report, (7) modified closed, and (8) closed. 
There are advantages to the new categories. For example, under 
the old system, there was a category ``open--restricted in 
part''. The whole concept of an open rule is to allow a member 
to offer any amendment that complies with the standing rules of 
the House. Once the rule is ``restricted in part'' it is a 
stretch to put it in any kind of open category. It is possible 
that 99% of the bill could be covered by the restrictive part 
of the rule and only 1% covered by the open part of the rule. 
The old system could be abused to make it sound as if there was 
a greater degree of openness than was really there. Under the 
new system, any rule that limits a member's right to offer any 
amendment allowed by the rules of the House cannot be called 
open. In addition the new system is somewhat simpler, having 
two fewer categories, while preserving the significant 
distinctions of the old system.
    During the 104th Congress both the majority and the 
minority have on numerous occasions inserted in the 
Congressional Record charts categorizing rules that provide an 
amendment structure.
    The majority in the 104th Congress has inserted charts 
using categories based on those that are used in this Survey of 
Activities. In order to simplify the summary at the beginning 
of the chart, categories have been consolidated into three; (1) 
open/modified open, (2) structured/modified closed, and (3) 
closed.
    The minority in the 104th Congress has inserted charts 
classifying rules in three categories: (1) open, (2) 
restrictive, and (3) closed. The chart of the minority contains 
a footnote noting that, ``Restrictive rules are those which 
limit the number of amendments which can be offered, and 
include so-called modified open and modified closed rules as 
well as completely closed rules and rules providing for 
consideration in the House as opposed to the Committee of the 
Whole. This definition of restrictive rule is taken from the 
Republican chart of resolutions reported from the Rules 
Committee in the 103rd Congress.''
    However, the Democrats' table does not confine itself to 
rules reported from the Rules Committee that were counted as 
open or restrictive as was done by the Republican minority in 
the 103rd Congress. The footnote to the Republican minority 
table indicated that, ``total rules counted are all order of 
business resolutions reported from the Rules Committee which 
provide for the initial consideration of legislation, except 
rules on appropriations bills which only waive points of order. 
Original jurisdiction measures reported as privileged are also 
not counted.''
    It should also be noted that Republican minority tables in 
the 103rd Congress only applied to bills, joint resolutions and 
budget resolutions, but not to other concurrent resolutions or 
simple House resolutions. If the Democratic minority were 
really using the same system used by the Republican minority in 
the 103rd Congress, a number of measures would be counted 
differently, such as the following.
    H. Res. 5--Providing for the consideration of H. Res. 6, 
House rules package. This would not have been counted by the 
then Rules minority because (a) it was not reported by the 
Rules Committee; and (b) it provided for consideration of a 
simple House resolution. Yet it is scored as a closed rule.
    H. Res. 6--Providing for the adoption of House rules and 
the consideration of H.R. 1, the Congressional Accountability 
and Compliance Act. This would not have been scored since it 
was not reported by the Rules Committee. Yet it is scored as a 
closed rule.
    H. Res. 38--Providing for consideration of H.R. 5, the 
Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. This is scored as ``restrictive'' 
because of a motion to limit amendments during consideration. 
But, the rule as reported was an open rule and would have been 
so counted. Motions to limit amendments are in order under 
House rules.
    H. Res. 43--Amending House rule XI regarding committee 
hearings. It is listed as restrictive though this was an 
original jurisdiction matter considered in the House as 
privileged without a rule. It would not have been listed by the 
Republican minority in its tables.
    H.R. 729--It is counted as restrictive even though it was 
considered under a time cap unanimous consent agreement. Since 
there was no rule reported, it would not have been counted by 
the Republican minority.
    S. 2--Senate congressional compliance bill. It is counted 
as closed, even though it was not brought up under a rule. It 
was considered under suspension of the rules--never counted by 
the Republican minority. If this suspension was counted as 
closed, why weren't all other suspension bills?
    H. Res. 268--Making in order H. Res. 250, the House gift 
rule. It is listed as closed, even though it makes in order two 
amendments. However, this would not have been counted by the 
Republican minority in the 103rd Congress since it applies to a 
simple House resolution. Only rules for bills and joint 
resolutions were counted, other than concurrent resolutions on 
the budget.
    H. Res. 334--Providing for the disposition of Senate 
amendments to H.R. 1643. It is counted as closed. The 
Republican minority in the 103rd Congress did not count rules 
that provided for the disposition of Senate amendments to 
previously passed House bills and joint resolutions.
    H. Res. 336--Providing for the disposition of Senate 
amendments to H.J. Res. 134. It is counted as closed. The 
Republican minority in the 103rd Congress did not count rules 
that provided for the disposition of Senate amendments to 
previously passed House bills and joint resolutions.
    H. Res. 338--Providing for the disposition of Senate 
amendments to H.R. 1358. It is counted as closed. The 
Republican minority in the 103rd Congress did not count rules 
that provided for the disposition of Senate amendments to 
previously passed House bills and joint resolutions.
    The above is only a partial compilation of items listed as 
restrictive or closed by the Democrats in the 104th Congress 
which would not have been listed that way by Republicans in the 
103rd. If the Democrats were truly using the same system in 
this Congress that they claim they are copying from the 
Republican minority's classification system in the 103rd 
Congress, there would be many fewer restrictive and closed 
rules than they are claiming.

b. Explanation of Types of Rules Granted

    This section focuses only on rules which provide for an 
amendment process. Therefore, rules providing for general 
debate only, stopping short of consideration of the measure for 
amendment, or waiving the two-thirds requirement are not 
included in this section. Rules for conference reports--which 
are otherwise privileged and, under regular order, non-
amendable--also are not included in this section:
          (1) Open. An open rule is one under which any member 
        may offer an amendment that complies with the standing 
        rules of the House and the Budget Act. Also included in 
        the category of open rules are those that have been 
        called ``open plus''. These rules allow the offering of 
        any amendment in order under an open rule--plus 
        amendments which have to be protected from a point of 
        order in order to be offered.
          (2) Modified open--time cap on consideration of 
        amendments. This type of rule permits any amendment in 
        order under an open rule, subject only to an overall 
        time limit on the amendment process. It allows the 
        House to manage its time, to make more reliable its 
        schedule and to provide some certainty about when 
        measures will be on and off the floor. Moreover, it 
        allows the majority and minority parties to offer 
        priority amendments of their choosing rather than 
        having the Rules Committee designate what amendments 
        can be offered.
          (3) Modified open--required preprinting in the 
        Congressional Record. This type of rule permits the 
        offering only of those amendments printed in the 
        Congressional Record. In some cases the rule requires 
        amendments to be printed by a specific date; in some 
        cases the amendment must be printed before the 
        consideration of the amendment and in other cases 
        before the consideration of the bill for any amendment. 
        In most cases these rules do not prohibit second degree 
        amendments. The preprinting requirement does not afford 
        the same time certainty as the time cap, since there is 
        no way to know in advance how many amendments will be 
        submitted and printed, how many printed amendments will 
        actually be offered, or how many roll call votes will 
        be called. Requiring that amendments be printed in 
        advance affords Members a better idea of the range of 
        issues to be debated and voted on, and it removes the 
        element of surprise at least from first degree 
        amendments.
          (4) Modified open--both time cap on consideration of 
        amendments and required preprinting in the 
        Congressional Record. This type of rule combines the 
        features of the two types of modified open rules listed 
        above along with the advantages and disadvantages of 
        each of them.
          (5) Structured or modified closed rule. A structured 
        or modified closed rule is one under which the Rules 
        Committee limits the amendments that may be offered 
        only to those amendments designated in the special rule 
        or the Rules Committee report to accompany it, or which 
        precludes amendments to a particular portion of a bill, 
        even though the rest of the bill may be completely open 
        to amendment. A modified closed rule is one which 
        allows the offering of only one or two amendments. A 
        structured rule is one which allows three or more 
        amendments. In the case of a structured or modified 
        closed rule, the Chairman generally will announce 
        through a one minute speech and a ``Dear Colleague'' 
        letter, the intention of the Committee to review all 
        amendments. He requests that Members provide the 
        Committee with copies of their proposed amendments in 
        advance of the Committee meeting date. In some 
        instances, the amendments made in order represent all 
        of the amendments submitted to the Committee. Some 
        rules being labeled as structured here would have been 
        called ``open--restricted in part'' by the Democratic 
        majority in the 103rd Congress. This tougher standard 
        for openness in the 104th Congress makes it look as if 
        the number of partially open rules is smaller than it 
        would have been by past standards.
          (6) Closed. This type of rule is one under which no 
        amendments may be offered other than amendments 
        recommended by the committee reporting the bill. It 
        should be noted that under House rules changes adopted 
        at the beginning of the 104th Congress, the Rules 
        Committee cannot report a special rule denying the 
        minority the right to offer amendatory instructions in 
        a motion to recommit if offered by the minority leader 
        or a designee. In the 103rd Congress a rule which 
        allowed a motion to recommit with amendatory 
        instructions, was labeled by the Democratic majority a 
        modified closed rule. In the 104th Congress with 
        tougher standards, it is now a closed rule. This change 
        makes it look as if there are more closed rules than 
        there would have been under the standard used by the 
        Democrats in the 103rd Congress.

c. A Move Toward a More Open Congress

    In the 95th Congress 85% of the rules were open rules. In a 
steady progression downward from Congress to Congress, the 
number of open rules decreased until it reached a low point of 
30% in the 103rd Congress.
    The 104th Congress has now reversed that downward trend. 
The percentage of open rules is now up to 46%. The percentage 
of modified open rules of all varieties is now 11%. Taken 
together this means that the total percentage of open/modified 
open rules is now 57%. This change has meant a greater 
opportunity for the representatives of the people to offer 
their ideas to their colleagues in the form of amendments and 
put the amendments to a majority vote. It should be noted that 
the majority in the 104th Congress has never advocated that all 
rules should be open. From the very beginning it was made clear 
that the long-standing precedent of closing off floor 
amendments to the Internal Revenue Code would be followed 
because the tax laws in this nation have already become overly 
complex. It was also clear that the House should follow the 
precedent of dealing with very large and complex matters like 
budget resolutions and budget reconciliation bills by only 
allowing full substitutes to be offered. However, when it has 
been feasible the 104th Congress has moved toward a more open 
process. And this is in spite of the fact that the definitions 
of closed rules and structured rules now include many rules 
that the majority in past Congresses would have classified 
differently.

d. Special procedures--``King-of-the-Hill'' Displaced by ``Most-Votes-
        Wins''

    In recent congresses the then-majority had come 
increasingly to rely on a procedure known as king-of-the-hill. 
The initial justification for the king-of-the-hill procedure 
was that it allowed alternative versions of an amendment to 
compete for adoption. Regular order does not permit further 
amendments to a text once it has been amended in its entirety. 
Under the king-of- the-hill procedure several amendments posing 
solutions to the same problem are all made in order, are all 
voted on, and the last one adopted becomes the text of the 
bill. It is this last feature which caused the problem. By 
providing that the last proposal to get a majority wins, the 
rule sets up the possibility that an amendment could receive a 
larger vote and still be defeated if a later proposal receives 
a simple majority of the votes. For example, if the first 
proposal received 400 votes, the second proposal received 300 
votes, and the third proposal received 218 votes, the proposal 
receiving the 218 votes would prevail under the old king-of-
the-hill procedure. To Republicans this always seemed unfair. 
It gave the then-majority Democratic leadership the ability to 
stack the deck in favor of the proposal they wanted to win, 
even if it did not have nearly as much support as some other 
alternative.
    Finally in the 104th Congress the new Republican majority 
was able to implement a proposal it had offered unsuccessfully 
in the past. The new approach is called ``most votes wins''. A 
``most votes wins'' rule allows the House to consider several 
alternative solutions to the same problem, but instead of 
providing that the last one to receive a majority wins, it 
provides that the proposal with the most votes wins, regardless 
of whether it was offered, first, last, or somewhere in the 
middle. This preserves the major benefit of the king-of-the-
hill procedure, that is, permitting the House to consider 
several different solutions to the same problem, but it 
eliminates the main drawback of the king-of-the-hill procedure, 
that is, the possibility that the proposal receiving the most 
votes could lose.

                   4. FLOOR CONSIDERATION OF THE RULE

    When time comes to present a rule, the majority member who 
filed the rule (a privileged House resolution), or another 
majority member of the Rules Committee designated by the 
chairman, is recognized by the Speaker. That Member stands at 
the majority committee table on the House Floor. Once 
recognized, the Member states:

          Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, 
        I call up House Resolution ______________, and ask for 
        its immediate consideration.

(Any member of the Committee on Rules may be recognized to call 
up a rule that has been on the House Calendar for at least 
seven legislative days, and the Speaker is required to 
recognize the Rules Committee member as a question of the 
highest privilege, so long as the member has given one-day's 
notice of an intent to seek recognition for that purpose.)
    Once the Clerk has read the resolution, the Speaker 
recognizes the majority Rules Committee member handling the 
rules for one hour. The majority floor manager then customarily 
yields thirty minutes to his minority counterpart for the 
purposes of debate only, and debate on the rule is started. The 
length of debate on the rule varies according to the degrees of 
controversy over the bill or the complexity of the rule, but 
debate on most noncontroversial rules is over within fifteen or 
twenty minutes and the rule may be accepted by voice vote.
    Since a rule is considered in the House under the hour 
rule, no amendments are in order unless the floor manager 
offers an amendment or yields to another Member for that 
purpose. At the conclusion of debate on the rule, the floor 
manager moves the previous question. If no objection is heard, 
the House proceeds to vote on the rule. If objection is heard, 
a vote occurs on the previous question. If the previous 
question is rejected, however, a Member who opposed the 
previous question (usually the Rules Committee minority floor 
manager) is recognized. That Member then controls one hour of 
debate time on the amendment. The Member controlling the time 
may offer an amendment to the rule and then move the previous 
question on the amendment and on the rule when debate has 
concluded. Once the rule is adopted (with or without 
amendments), the legislation it concerns is eligible for 
consideration under the terms of the rule.

                 5. RULES REJECTED, TABLED, OR PENDING

    In the 104th Congress, the Committee on Rules reported 230 
rules. The House adopted 215 of these rules, rejected one rule, 
and tabled twelve rules. Two rules remained pending on the 
House Calendar at adjournment.

a. Rules rejected by the House

    House Resolution 185, providing for the consideration of 
H.R. 1977, making appropriations for the Department of the 
Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 1996, failed passage by a roll call vote of 192-
238 on July 12, 1995.

b. Rules tabled by the House

    House Resolution 47, providing for the consideration of H. 
Res. 43, to permit Committee Chairmen to schedule hearings, was 
laid on the table by unanimous consent on January 31, 1995.
    House Resolution 103, providing for the consideration of 
the bill H.R. 1058, the Securities Litigation Reform Act, was 
laid on the table March 7, 1995, pursuant to House Resolution 
105, another rule providing for the consideration of H.R. 1058. 
House Resolution 105 was adopted by a record vote of 257-155
    The following two House resolutions were both tabled by 
unanimous consent on May 17, 1995:
          House Resolution 147, providing for the consideration

        of the bill, S. 219, The Regulatory Transition Act of 
        1995.
    House Resolution 323, providing for the consideration of 
the bill, H.R. 2677, The National Parks and National Wildlife 
Refuge Systems Freedom Act of 1995, was laid on the table by 
unanimous consent on February 28, 1996.
    House Resolution 368, providing for the consideration of 
the bill H.R. 994, the Regulatory Sunset and Review Act of

1996.
    House Resolution 376, providing for general debate only on 
the bill H.R. 2703, the Comprehensive Antiterrorism Act of 
1995, was tabled by unanimous consent on March 13, 1996.
    By order of the Speaker, without objection, the following 
two resolutions were laid on the table on August 1, 1996:
          House Resolution 496 waiving points of order against 
        the conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 3603) 
        making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural 
        Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related 
        Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, 
        and for other purposes.
          House Resolution 497 waiving points of order against 
        the conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 
        3517), making appropriations for military construction, 
        family housing, and base realignment and closure for 
        the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending 
        September 30, 1997, and for other purposes.
    House Resolution 260 waiving a requirement of clause 4(b) 
of rule XI with respect to consideration of certain resolutions 
reported from the Committee on Rules, was laid on the table by 
unanimous consent on December 6, 1995.
    House Resolution 310 waiving the provisions of clause 
2(g)(3) of rule XI, requiring at least one week's advance

             8. WAIVERS OF UNFUNDED MANDATE POINTS OF ORDER

    Sec. 107(b) of Public Law 104-4; 109 Stat. 63, the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995, requires the Committee on Rules to 
include in its activity report a separate item identifying all 
waivers of points of order relating to Federal mandates, listed 
by bill or joint resolution and subject matter.
    The Committee is pleased to note that it can find no 
specific instance of waivers of points of order relating to 
Federal mandates in the time the Unfunded Mandates Law has been 
in effect. The Rules Committee, on a number of occasions, has 
waived all points of order against certain measures, and those 
waivers are detailed in Section III, B, 9 of this activity 
report.
    The Unfunded Mandates Law was designed to provide 
information to the Congress and the public about Federal 
mandates that may be contained in legislation. In this regard, 
the law established points of order against legislation 
containing unfunded mandates as defined in Sec. 425 of the 
Congressional Budget Act. Specifically, the section prohibits 
the consideration of any measure containing a private sector 
mandate costing in excess of $100 million in any year unless 
identified by a CBO statement in the report. And it prohibits 
the consideration of any measure, amendment, motion or 
conference report containing an unfunded intergovernmental 
mandate. The law further prohibits the Committee on Rules from 
waiving these points of order at Sec. 426. A point of order 
made against either an unfunded intergovernmental mandate or a 
rule waiving the mandate points of order triggers a 20 minute 
debate and a vote on whether to consider the measure or rule.
    In several prominent instances, the Committee on Rules 
specifically did not waive the unfunded mandates points of 
order established by the law. Where a question had been raised 
as to whether an unfunded mandate may exist in a particular 
piece of legislation, the Committee was careful to allow 
Members of the House an opportunity to raise a point of order 
and consider it on the House floor. In these cases, the 
Committee generally waived all points of order except those 
arising under Sec. 425 of the Congressional Budget Act.
    Special rules which waived all points of order except those 
arising under Section 425(a) of the Congressional Budget Act 
(Unfunded Mandates Reform) against consideration of the 
legislation:

        2. Original Jurisdiction Measures Reported or Discharged

a. Committee hearing schedules (H. Res. 43)

    In the first session of the 104th Congress, the Committee 
on Rules considered a House rules change which clarified the 
longstanding practice of the House in the area of committee 
hearing scheduling. The Committee was successful in fashioning 
a bipartisan compromise text and passing the measure on the 
House floor as well.
    In the initial weeks of the 104th Congress, a parliamentary 
question arose as to the literal meaning of clause 2(g)(3) of 
rule XI, which requires that each committee call hearings at 
least a week in advance unless the committee determines there 
is good cause to schedule them sooner. The House 
Parliamentarian confirmed that use of the term ``committee'' in 
the rule implies that the committee must act as a collegial 
body to ratify the call and scheduling of hearings. The 
longstanding practice of the House, in the view of many Members 
and the Parliamentarian, has been for Members to defer to the 
chairmen of committees and subcommittees on the question of 
setting dates for committee hearings.
    As a result of a point of order raised against a particular 
hearing that was overruled by a committee chairman and the 
understanding of the Parliamentarian's ruling, the schedules of 
committees and the House were thrown into a state of 
uncertainty. Because of the ambitious legislative agenda in the 
opening weeks of the 104th Congress, the Committee on Rules 
began an immediate examination of the rule and its 
interpretation, and possible solutions.
    On January 23, 1995, Rules Chairman Solomon introduced H. 
Res. 43, a resolution amending House rules to permit chairmen 
to call hearings at least a week in advance unless the chairmen 
determine there is good cause to hold them sooner. On January 
26, 1995, the Rules Committee met to consider H. Res. 43 as a 
matter of original jurisdiction and, after discussion, ordered 
the resolution reported to the House by voice vote.
    The report to accompany H. Res. 43 (House Report 104-5), 
filed on January 27, 1995, stated that the current 
interpretation of House rules regarding committee hearing 
schedules left committee chairmen in an untenable position. The 
report asserted that ``many chairmen may find it more 
convenient not to hold hearings than to risk points of order 
that will stop the hearing in their tracks or will imperil the 
future consideration of legislation by the House.'' In the 
interest of providing the maximum amount of information to the 
House and the public about pending legislation in committees, 
the Rules Committee recommended the rule change contained in H. 
Res. 43.
    The Minority Views included in House Report 104-5 agreed 
that the parliamentary interpretation of the standing rule did 
not conform to the longstanding practice of committee chairmen 
in the House. However, the minority members of the Rules 
Committee expressed concern that H. Res. 43 would allow 
chairmen alone to determine whether there is good cause to hold 
a hearing sooner than with seven days notice. The minority 
report went on to state that while the rule should be corrected 
to reflect the common practice of scheduling hearings, it 
``should not enhance the power of the chair.''
    House resolutions amending the standing rules and reported 
by the Committee on Rules are typically privileged for 
consideration on the House floor and are not subject to 
amendment. However, because of the concerns of the minority 
members of the Rules Committee and several other ranking 
minority members on other House committees, the Rules Committee 
reported an open rule by voice vote on January 27, 1995 (H. 
Res. 47; House Report 104-6).
    Prior to floor consideration of H. Res. 43, Chairman 
Solomon invited Rules Ranking Member Moakley and several other 
ranking members of committees to a meeting to discuss their 
concerns. Based on that meeting, Chairman Solomon crafted an 
amendment to the reported resolution which addressed the 
concerns of the minority.
    On January 31, 1995, Chairman Solomon called up H. Res. 43 
and asked for its immediate consideration in the House. At the 
appropriate point, Chairman Solomon offered an amendment to the 
resolution that would permit a chairman to call hearings a week 
in advance, and permit the chairman, with the concurrence of 
the ranking minority member, or by vote of the committee, to 
call them sooner for good cause. The compromise amendment was 
agreed to by voice vote, and the resolution, as amended, was 
agreed to by voice vote. H. Res. 47 was subsequently laid on 
the table.

b. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (H.R. 5)

    H.R. 5 was one of the key measures included in the 
Republican ``Contract With America.'' It was introduced on 
January 4, 1995, by Representatives William Clinger (R-PA), Rob 
Portman (R-OH), Thomas Davis (R-VA) and Gary Condit (D-CA) to 
make Congress more accountable when imposing new Federal 
mandates on States, local governments, and tribal governments 
without providing adequate funding to comply with such 
mandates. Specifically, the bill sought to curb the practice of 
imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and local 
governments, ensure that the Federal Government pays the costs 
incurred by those governments in complying with certain 
requirements under Federal statutes and regulations, and 
provide information on the cost of Federal mandates on the 
private sector
    H.R. 5 was referred to the Committee on Government Reform 
and Oversight, and sequentially to the Committees on Rules, the 
Budget, and the Judiciary. The jurisdiction of the Rules 
Committee was limited to Title III, Section 301 (amendments to 
the Budget Act at Sections 424 c and d, Section 425, and 
Section 426), Section 302 (amending House rules XI and XXIII), 
and Section 303 (exercise of rulemaking powers).
    The Rules Committee held a briefing for Members and staff 
on January 5, 1995, in which Mr. James L. Blum, Deputy Director 
of the Congressional Budget Office, and Mr. Stanley Bach, a 
Senior Specialist in American National Government with the 
Congressional Research Service, described the provisions of 
H.R. 5 and the implications of the legislation with respect to 
the CBO and the various congressional committees.
    On January 11, 1995, the Rules Committee held an open 
hearing on H.R. 5. The Committee heard from two panels. 
Witnesses on the first panel consisted of the Hon. William 
Clinger (R-PA), the Hon. Rob Portman (R-OH), the Hon. Thomas 
Davis (R-VA), and the Hon. Gary Condit (D-CA). Witnesses on the 
second panel consisted of: Ms. Nancy Donaldson, Director of 
Political Affairs, Service Employees International Union; Mr. 
Jim St. George, Assistant Director of State Fiscal Projects, 
Center for Budget Priorities; and Greg Wetstone, Director of 
Legislation, Natural Resources Defense Council.
    On January 10, 1995, H.R. 5 was ordered reported by the 
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, with amendments 
to those sections within that committee's jurisdiction (House 
Report 104-1, Part II). On January 12, 1995, the Committee on 
Rules met to mark up H.R. 5 and ordered the measure reported 
with amendments to those sections within the committee's 
jurisdiction by a record vote of 9 to 4 (House Report 104-1, 
Part I). The Committee on the Budget and the Committee on the 
Judiciary were both discharged from consideration of H.R. 5.
    On January 18, 1995, the Committee on Rules, by a recorded 
vote of 8 to 3, granted an open rule for the consideration of 
H.R. 5 in the House. It provided for two hours of general 
debate, divided between the Committees on Government Reform and 
Oversight and Rules; made in order an amendment in the nature 
of a substitute as original text for amendment purposes, to be 
considered by title rather than section; gave priority 
recognition to members who had preprinted amendments in the 
Congressional Record prior to their consideration; and provided 
one motion to recommit with or without instructions. The rule 
was considered on the House floor on January 19, 1995, and 
approved by voice vote.
    On February 1, 1995, H.R. 5 passed the House by recorded 
vote of 360-74. Following final passage, the House took from 
the Speaker's table and moved to the consideration of S. 1, a 
similar measure to H.R. 5 which passed the Senate on January 
27, 1995. The House struck all after the enacting clause, 
substituted the language of H.R. 5, insisted on its amendments 
and requested a conference with the Senate. The Speaker 
appointed Representative David Dreier and Representative Joseph 
Moakley to represent the Committee on Rules in the conference 
committee.
    On March 13, 1995, the conference report on S. 1 was filed 
in the House (House Report 104-76). The Rules Committee met on 
March 15, 1996, and ordered reported by voice vote a rule 
waiving all points of order against the conference report to 
accompany S. 1. However, the rule was not considered in the 
House because the full House agreed by unanimous consent on 
March 15, 1995, to waive all points of order against the 
conference report on S. 1. The Senate passed the conference 
report on March 15, with House passage occurring on March 16, 
1995, by a vote of 394-28. S. 1 was signed into law by the 
President on March 22, 1995 (Public Law No: 104-4).

c. House Corrections Calendar (H. Res. 168)

    On June 6, 1995, Representative Barbara Vucanovich 
introduced H. Res. 161, a resolution to amend House rules by 
abolishing the Consent Calendar of the House (Rule XIII, clause 
4) and replacing it with a corrections calendar for 
consideration of legislation to deal with useless and absurd 
Federal rules, regulations and judicial decisions. H. Res. 161 
would allow the Speaker to place reported bills on the 
Corrections Calendar, and would further allow them to be called 
up for consideration on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each 
month subject to one hour of debate and a three-fifths vote for 
passage. No amendments are in order unless recommended by the 
reporting committee or offered by the chairman.
    On June 13, 1995, the Committee on Rules held a hearing on 
H. Res. 161 and heard testimony from members of the Steering 
Group, (Representatives Vucanovich, Zeliff, and McIntosh,) 
several other Members from both parties, and academic 
witnesses.
    The Rules Committee met to mark up H. Res. 161 on June 15, 
1995. During the markup, three amendments were adopted. Since 
the Committee has privilege to report, the Committee voted to 
favorably report a new, privileged resolution consisting of the 
text of H. Res. 161, as amended by the Committee during the 
markup, and that H. Res. 161 be laid on the table. Chairman 
Solomon then filed a report in the House on H. Res. 168 (House 
Report 104-144) on June 16, 1995.
    H. Res. 168 transformed the Consent Calendar (clause 4 of 
rule XIII) into the Corrections Calendar. It further provided 
the Speaker the authority to place reported bills, after 
consultation with the Minority Leader, on the Corrections 
Calendar. The resolution stipulated that bills must be on the 
calendar for at least three legislative days before being 
called up on the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month. 
Bills called up on the Corrections Calendar, under H. Res. 168, 
are debatable for one hour with no amendments unless 
recommended by the reporting committee or offered by the 
chairman. A motion to recommit with or without instructions by 
the minority was allowed under H. Res. 168. Finally, a three-
fifths vote was required for passage of a Corrections Day bill.
    The Minority Members of the Rules Committee filed Minority 
Views to House Report 104-144 asserting that the new procedure 
is both unfair to the minority and unnecessary. The minority 
argued that the House employs the suspension of the rules 
procedure for most noncontroversial legislation and the 
Corrections Calendar would be duplicative. The minority 
expressed concern that the resolution contained no clear 
definition of Corrections bills, and that the minority as a 
whole may be shut out of the advisory group proceedings.
    On June 20, 1995, H. Res. 168 passed the House by a vote of 
271-146. The Speaker announced on that day the creation of a 
Corrections Day Advisory Group, to be chaired by Representative 
Barbara Vucanovich and co-chaired by Representatives McIntosh 
and Zeliff. The bipartisan group consisted of 12 Members, 
including Rules Chairman Solomon and Representative David 
Dreier. The bipartisan advisory group was charged with ushering 
corrections bills through the legislative process and making a 
recommendation to the Speaker as to which reported bills should 
be placed on the Corrections Calendar.

d. The House Gift Rule (H. Res. 250)

    The revision of the House Gift Rule was undertaken as part 
of the new majority's historic efforts to make the House more 
responsible and accountable to the people. H. Res. 250 responds 
to the bipartisan belief that the House needed a more stringent 
and more detailed policy on the acceptance of gifts by Members, 
officers and employees.
    H. Res. 250 was introduced by Representative Enid Waldholtz 
(R-UT) and 19 bipartisan original cosponsors on October 30, 
1995, and was referred to the Committee on Rules. It sought to 
create a new House rule relating to the acceptance of gifts, an 
internal policy matter that had previously been addressed in 
clause 4 of House rule XLIII, the Code of Official Conduct.
    Previous proposals on this subject introduced in the 104th 
Congress took the form of amendments to House rule XLIII, and 
were therefore exclusively in the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Standards of Official Conduct. However, since the leadership 
had made a commitment to proceed with gift reform and the 
Standards Committee intended to take no formal action, the 
Rules Committee sought to expedite consideration of gift 
reform. In order to avoid having an unreported measure in the 
jurisdiction of the Standards Committee brought directly to the 
floor, proponents of gift reform rewrote their proposals in the 
form of a rules change (H. Res. 250) so that the matter would 
fall within the original jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules 
and an orderly, thorough legislative process could be employed.
    The substance of H. Res. 250 as introduced was nearly 
identical to that of S. Res. 158, which changed Senate rules to 
limit the value of gifts that may be accepted by Members, 
officers and employees. The Senate adopted S. Res. 158 on July 
25, 1995, by a vote of 98-0. Subsequently pressure mounted from 
Members and from outside groups for the House to follow suit 
and address the issue.
    Specifically, H. Res. 250 placed a $50 limit on the value 
of individual gifts, including meals and entertainment, and 
established a cumulative annual limit of $100 that may be 
accepted from any one source. The cumulative annual limit 
applied only to gifts whose value exceeds $10. The resolution 
included additional restrictions on the acceptance of travel 
associated with recreational and charity events as well as 
additional disclosure requirements for travel reimbursements. 
The resolution also detailed a series of exceptions to the new 
rule and set an effective date of January 1, 1996. Among the 
major differences between this proposal and the prior rule was 
the inclusion of meals in the definition of a gift and the $10, 
$50 and $100 thresholds.
    Because of the broad interest in seeing this issue 
addressed expeditiously, the Committee on Rules accepted the 
responsibility for considering and reporting new gift rules in 
the House.
    In order to ensure that Members and staff had sufficient 
expertise to address this technical topic, the Committee on 
November 1, 1995 held a briefing featuring CRS Legislative 
Attorney Jack Maskell, CRS Specialist in American National 
Government Richard Sachs and Standards Committee Counsel Ellen 
Weintraub.
    A general hearing was held the following day, on November 
2, 1995. The Committee heard testimony from 12 Members, some of 
whom supported the reform proposal and others who raised 
concerns about its provisions and who questioned the need for 
reform. A second hearing, involving testimony from outside 
witnesses and the Chairman of the Committee on Standards of 
Official Conduct, was held on November 7, 1995. Chairwoman 
Nancy Johnson provided the Rules Committee with her Committee's 
bipartisan suggestions for technical changes to improve the 
language of the resolution.
    The Committee marked-up the resolution on November 14, 
1995, agreeing to nine technical amendments offered by Chairman 
Solomon that were based on the recommendations of the Committee 
on Standards. H. Res. 250 as amended was ordered favorably 
reported by the Committee by a nonrecord vote.
    H. Res. 250, reported as a matter of original jurisdiction 
by the Committee, was privileged for floor consideration. 
However, recognizing that there was interest among the 
membership in offering amendments to the resolution, the 
Committee met on November 15, 1995 and, by voice vote, granted 
a special rule for floor consideration (H. Res. 268). The rule 
allowed for two amendments, one to be offered by Representative 
Burton or his designee and one to be offered by the Speaker of 
the House or his designee.
    The Burton amendment attempted to change the focus of the 
gift rule, focusing on full disclosure rather than prohibition. 
The Gingrich amendment sought to eliminate the monetary 
thresholds and several of the exceptions, having the effect of 
creating a near-total gift ban.
    On November 16, 1995, the date set aside for this issue by 
the Majority Leader, the House took up H. Res. 250 after 
adopting the rule for its consideration by voice vote. After a 
lively debate, the House defeated the Burton amendment by a 
vote of 154-276. Subsequently the House adopted the Gingrich 
amendment, which was offered on the floor by Mr. Solomon, by a 
vote of 422-8. The House passed H. Res. 250, as amended, by a 
vote of 422-6.
    Additional action on the gift rule occurred on November 30, 
1995 during House consideration of H. Res. 254, making 
technical corrections in the Rules of the House. Two exceptions 
that had been deleted by passage of the Gingrich amendment were 
restored to the rule and the necessary conforming changes to 
rule XLIII were also made.
    The new gift rule, which effectively bans gifts and 
establishes new restrictions on travel and disclosure, took 
effect as House rule LII on January 1, 1996.

e. Legislative line item veto (H.R. 2)

    H.R. 2, the Line Item Veto Act, a key item in the Contract 
With America, was introduced by Representatives Clinger, Blute, 
Neumann and Parker on January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 
104th Congress, with 150 cosponsors. The bill was referred to 
the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and in 
addition to the Committee on Rules for a period to be 
subsequently determined by the Speaker.
    H.R. 2 requires that, unless the Congress acts within a 
specified period to disapprove the President's rescissions, 
those rescissions will automatically take effect and the 
identified spending or targeted tax benefit will be canceled. 
If the Congress disapproves the President's rescissions, the 
President would be likely to veto that disapproval, forcing the 
Congress to muster two thirds of both Houses to override that 
veto. In this way, it becomes more difficult to sustain 
spending or targeted tax breaks that the President has 
attempted to cancel.
    H.R. 2, a bipartisan bill was virtually identical to the 
Solomon, line item veto substitute that was narrowly rejected 
in the second session of the 103rd Congress. During the 103rd 
Congress the line item veto was considered twice.
    On January 24, 1995 the Rules Committee held an informal 
briefing on Section 5 of H.R. 2 (which dealt with the 
consideration of a disapproval bill in the House and the 
Senate). Stanley Bach, senior specialist in the legislative 
process at CRS, provided Members and staff with general 
background and options for applying expedited procedures to 
consideration of a bill to disapprove a Presidential rescission 
or targeted tax break veto message.
    The Rules Committee met on January 26, 1995 to mark up H.R. 
2. The Committee ordered H.R. 2 reported with amendments by a 
record vote of 9-4. During the markup two amendments pertaining 
to expedited procedures were offered en bloc by Mr. Goss and 
agreed to by voice vote. An amendment in the nature of a 
substitute offered by Mr. Moakley was rejected by a record vote 
of 4-9. The Moakley amendment would have required a 
Congressional vote on the President's rescissions under 
expedited procedures. The report was filed by Mr. Solomon on 
January 27, 1995 (H. Rpt. 104-11, Part 1).
    The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight held a 
joint hearing with the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs 
on January 25, 1995 on the line item veto. The Government 
Reform and Oversight Committee favorably reported H.R. 2, as 
amended, on January 25, 1995 by a vote of 30 to 11 with one 
Member voting present (H. Rpt. 104-11, Part 2).
    On February 1, 1995, the Rules Committee granted an open 
rule (H. Res. 55), for the consideration of H.R. 2 by the full 
House. The rule was carried for the majority by Mr. Goss and by 
Mr. Bielenson for the minority. H. Res. 55 was adopted by voice 
vote on February 2, 1995.
    After days of debate and after defeating amendments dealing 
with application to tax incentives and contract authority, 
expansion of the definition of targeted tax benefit, and 
substitute amendments dealing with expedited rescission, the 
House passed H.R. 2, as amended, by a vote of 294 to 134 on 
February 6, 1995. H.R. 2 was never considered by the Senate.
    However, the Senate did consider a similar bill, S. 4, the 
Line Item Veto Act of 1995, introduced by Senator Dole on 
January 4, 1995. The Senate passed S. 4, as amended by a vote 
on 69 to 29 on March 23, 1995. The House held S. 4 at the desk 
until May 17, 1995 at which time the House took up S. 4, struck 
all after the enacting clause and substituted the text of H.R. 
2. The Senate then disagreed to the House amendments and 
requested a conference on June 20, 1995. The House agreed to a 
conference on September 7, 1995. Representative Solomon and 
Representative Goss were chosen as House conferees from the 
Rules Committee.
    S. 4, as passed by the Senate, granted the President line 
item veto authority under a procedure known as ``separate 
enrollment.'' Separate enrollment required the House and Senate 
enrolling clerks to separately enroll each item of spending in 
a separate bill, each of which are then presented to the 
President for approval or disapproval individually. In 
contrast, H.R. 2, as passed by the House, granted the President 
line item veto authority based on the enhanced rescission 
format. This procedure authorized the President to rescind all 
or part of an item of discretionary budget authority or a 
targeted tax benefit within established parameters. The 
conference agreement more closely resembled the approach 
originally taken by the House.
    The conference report on S. 4 was filed in the House on 
March 21, 1996. The Senate agreed to the conference report on 
March 27, 1996 by a vote of 69 to 31. The House agreed to the 
conference report on March 28 pursuant to the adoption of H. 
Res. 391, the rule granting consideration of the H.R. 3136, the 
Contract With America Advancement Act. S.4 was signed into law 
on April 9, 1996, (Public Law 104-130).

f. Deficit reduction lock-box (H.R. 1162)

    H.R. 1162, establishing a deficit reduction lock-box and 
providing for the downward adjustment of discretionary spending 
limits in appropriation bills, was introduced by Mr. Crapo of 
Idaho on March 8, 1995. The Deficit Reduction Lock-Box Act of 
1995 was referred to the Committee on the Budget and to the 
Committees on Government Reform and Oversight and Rules for a 
period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker. H.R. 1162 
was referred to the Rules Subcommittee on the Legislative and 
Budget Process on April 27, 1995.
    The Deficit Reduction Lock-Box Act of 1995 established a 
procedure to ensure that savings from cuts in Appropriation 
measures during House and Senate consideration would be 
captured for deficit reduction. The bill amended the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish a deficit 
reduction lock-box process and provided for the downward 
adjustment of the discretionary spending caps.
    During both the 103rd and the 104th Congresses, bipartisan 
members of Congress repeatedly sought to establish proposals to 
capture savings made during the consideration ofappropriation 
bills and to credit those savings toward deficit reduction. In essence 
the proposal was designed to make a spending cut adopted by the House 
an actual cut in spending. Specifically in the 104th Congress, the 
issue arose in several contexts.
    During initial House consideration of H.R. 1158, the 
Emergency Supplemental Disaster Assistance and Rescissions Act 
for FY 1995, the House adopted an amendment applying the net 
savings in budget authority from the bill to a Deficit 
Reduction Trust Fund and authorizing the Secretary of the 
Treasury to use the amounts in the fund solely for the purpose 
of reducing the public debt.
    As passed by the House, H.R. 1158 also required the 
Director of OMB to reduce discretionary spending limits by the 
aggregate amount of spending reductions in the bill, including 
the out-year effect of the rescissions. These provisions were 
modified in conference to reflect the Senate's position and the 
final conference report on H.R. 1158 included only an 
authorization for the Director of OMB to adjust downward the 
discretionary caps for fiscal years 1995-98. The Conference 
Report on H.R. 1158 was adopted by the House on May 18, 1995 
and by the Senate on May 25, 1995 but was vetoed by the 
President on June 7, 1995.
    On June 29, 1995, the House passed a compromise version of 
the Emergency Supplemental Disaster Assistance and Rescissions 
Act in the form of H.R. 1944, which included the identical 
limited lock-box language that was in the vetoed bill, H.R. 
1158. The Senate passed this measure on July 21, 1995 which was 
signed into law on July 27, 1995 (P.L. 104-19), but without the 
House lock-box provisions.
    On July 11, 1995, the Rules Committee's Subcommittee on 
Legislative and Budget Process held a joint subcommittee 
hearing on lock-box proposals with the Government Reform and 
Oversight's Subcommittee on Government Management, Information 
and Technology. Witnesses testifying in favor of establishing a 
lock-box process included Representative Michael Crapo (R-ID), 
Representative Bill Brewster (D-OK), Representative Edward 
Royce (R-CA), Representative Jane Harman (D-CA), Representative 
Dick Zimmer and Representative Mark Foley (R-FL). In addition, 
testimony was heard from OMB Director Alice Rivlin and CBO 
Deputy Director James Blum.
    The Rules Committee met on July 20, 1995 to mark up H.R. 
1162. The Committee ordered H.R. 1162 favorably reported with 
amendments by a voice vote. During the markup, a Chairman's 
mark was offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute 
to be considered as original text for the purpose of amendment. 
Seven amendments to the Chairman's mark offered by 
Representative Goss, pertaining to the function of the lock-box 
mechanism, tally of floor amendments on appropriations bills, 
reduction of the discretionary spending caps, and technical 
corrections were offered en bloc and adopted by voice vote. An 
amendment pertaining to retroactive application offered by Mr. 
Frost was defeated by a record vote of 29. The amendment in the 
nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to by voice 
vote. The Committee then ordered the bill to be favorably 
reported to the House, with amendment, by voice vote (H. Rpt. 
104-205, Part 1).
    The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight took no 
further action on the bill and waived their jurisdiction with 
regard to any further consideration. The Committee on the 
Budget waived its jurisdiction with regard to consideration of 
the bill.
    On August 4, 1995, the House passed by a vote of 373 to 53, 
the text of H.R. 1162, as reported, as an amendment to H.R. 
2127, the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriation bill for FY 
1996. Under H. Res. 208, providing for consideration of the 
bill, the Rules Committee granted a waiver of clause 7 of rule 
XVI (prohibiting consideration of non-germane amendments) 
against an amendment by Mr. Crapo consisting of the text of 
H.R. 1162. H.R. 2127 was never considered on the Senate floor 
so the amendment did not proceed.
    On September 12, 1995, the Rules Committee granted an open 
rule (H. Res. 218) for consideration of H.R. 1162 providing one 
hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the 
Chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. Goss carried the rule for the majority with Mr. Frost 
carrying the rule for the minority. On September 13, 1995 the 
rule was adopted by voice vote.
    During consideration of the bill, many amendments were 
debated, adopted and defeated. The amendments receiving 
recorded votes were as follows. Mr. Goss offered an amendment 
to retroactively apply the provisions of the bill to the fiscal 
1996 Defense, Labor--HHS, and District of Columbia 
Appropriations bills. This amendment sought to maximize amount 
of possible savings from the FY 1996 appropriations bills 
without over complicating the future consideration of the 
appropriation bills which the House had already approved. Mr. 
Frost of Texas sought to amend the Goss amendment to apply to 
all the fiscal 1996 appropriation bills. The Frost amendment to 
the Goss amendment was defeated by a vote of 204 to 221. The 
Goss amendment was subsequently adopted by voice vote. The 
House also rejected an amendment by Mrs. Meek of Florida which 
would have prohibited any money saved through ``lock-box'' 
reductions in the discretionary spending caps from beings used 
to offset tax cuts. This amendment was defeated by a vote of 
144 to 282. H.R. 1162 was ultimately adopted by the House by a 
vote of 364 to 59. H.R. 1162 was not considered by the Senate.
    On March 7, 1996, the House considered H.R. 3019, the 
Omnibus Appropriations Bill for FY 1996. The House again 
adopted an amendment offered by Mr. Crapo (revised text of H.R. 
1162) to the bill by a vote of 329 to 89. During consideration 
of the bill in the Senate a Budget Act point of order was 
raised against the lock-box provisions by the Chairman Dominici 
(NM) of the Senate Budget Committee which was sustained by a 
vote of 36 to 57. The conference report on H.R. 3019 did not 
contain any lock-box language.

g. Technical corrections (H. Res. 254)

    On January 4, 1995, the House of Representatives approved 
H. Res. 6, adopting the Rules of the House for the 104th 
Congress. That resolution implemented sweeping changes to the 
rules under which the House previously operated. During the 
first session of the 104th Congress, the House approved 
additional changes to House rules. These included creating new 
points of order, established by the Unfunded Mandates Reform 
Act, which ensured that Members can have a vote on unfunded 
Federal mandates contained in legislation; abolishing the 
``Consent Calendar'' and establishing in its place a 
``Corrections Calendar''; and establishing new rules limiting 
the acceptance of gifts by Members, officers and employees of 
the House.
    As a result of these changes, a number of duplicative 
provisions and grammatical and typographical errors needed to 
be corrected to ensure that the Rules of the House reflected 
the true intent of the legislation. In addition, a number of 
long-standing parliamentary interpretations needed to be 
clarified to ensure consistency of parliamentary practice in 
the House. Rules Committee action was necessary to make these 
technical corrections to the rules of the House.
    On November 7, 1995, Chairman Solomon introduced H. Res. 
254, making technical corrections to the Rules of the House of 
Representatives. The Rules Committee met to mark up the 
resolution as a matter of original jurisdiction on November 14, 
1995, and after adopting two amendments, ordered the resolution 
reported by voice vote. A report was filed in the House on 
November 14, 1995 (House Report 104-340).
    H. Res. 254 made technical and conforming changes to the 
Rules of the House in the following areas: Office of the 
Inspector General; Committee on National Security; Committee on 
Small Business; Special oversight functions of the Committee on 
Resources; Special oversight functions of the Committee on 
Commerce; three-day layover for filing of supplemental, 
minority, or additional views, committee reports, 
appropriations hearings and reports, conference reports, and 
Senate amendments to measures reported in disagreement; 
committee broadcast rules; committee staff; Corrections 
Calendar; privilege for measures reported by the Committee on 
Ways and Means; Unfunded mandate reform; and the gift rule.
    Rules Ranking Member Moakley filed Additional Views to 
House Report 104-340 asserting that the United States 
government is on the brink of financial collapse and shutdown 
because of the Congress' failure to pass a bill to raise the 
debt ceiling and a continuing resolution to keep the government 
open. With this backdrop, Moakley added, ``the Republican 
Leadership is correcting grammar and punctuation in the rules 
of the House.'' The Minority members of the Rules Committee 
filed Minority Views questioning the timing of the technical 
corrections resolution, while the government faces a potential 
shutdown and a potential borrowing crisis. Additionally, the 
minority members argued that three other changes to House rules 
at the onset of the Congress have been routinely violated and 
should be addressed in this context: the three-fifths vote 
requirement to pass an income tax rate increase; subcommittee 
assignment limitations for Members; and the prohibition on 
committees sitting while the House is considering legislation 
under the five-minute rule.
    Representative David Dreier, Chairman of the Rules and 
Organization Subcommittee of the Rules Committee, called up H. 
Res. 254 by unanimous consent on November 30, 1995. 
Representative Dreier also offered an amendment to the 
resolution to allow certain exemptions to the House gift rule. 
The amendment exempted donations of home state products 
intended primarily for promotional purposes, and items of 
nominal value such as greeting cards and baseball caps. The 
changes contained in this amendment were inadvertently left out 
of the Gingrich-Solomon amendment to the gift ban rule change 
when it was first considered on the House floor. The amendment 
was agreed to by voice vote and the resolution, as amended, 
passed the House by voice vote.

h. Book contracts (H. Res. 299)

    As part of its disposition of specific ethics complaints, 
the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in December of 
1995 announced its intention to seek a change in House Rules to 
clarify the status of copyright royalties within the limits on 
outside earned income. Under House rule XLVII at that time, 
outside earned income was subject to a limit of $20,040 per 
year, but usual and customary copyright royalties were exempted 
from the definition of outside earned income.
    The specific case under consideration by the Committee in 
1995 led to much public comment about the adequacy of this 
rule. The House Ethics Manual notes that ``House Rule 47 has 
long exempted book royalties from outside earned income 
restrictions, royalties being deemed a return on the author's 
intellectual property, akin to other unrestricted returns on 
property.'' Yet the Committee on Standards noted in its report 
that the case under its consideration involved an ``original 
advance [that] greatly exceeded the financial bounds of any 
book contract contemplated at the time the current rules were 
drafted.''
    On December 12, 1995, Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct Chairwoman Nancy Johnson introduced H. Res. 299, a 
proposal to revise House rule XLVII to prohibit Members, 
officers and certain employees from receiving advances for 
writing books and to subject copyright royalties to the earned 
income cap. This resolution was introduced with the bipartisan 
sponsorship of 9 of the 10 members of the Committee on 
Standards and was referred exclusively to the Committee on 
Rules as a matter of original jurisdiction. Chairwoman Johnson 
requested expeditious consideration of the measure to allow the 
House to act prior to the end of the session.
    Specifically, as introduced, H. Res. 299 would amend clause 
3 of rule XLVII to count copyright royalties as part of earned 
income subject to the income cap of 15 percent of the Member's, 
officer's or employee's salary, although works published prior 
to an individual becoming a Member, officer or employee would 
be grandfathered. In addition, the resolution prohibited 
payments of advances to Members, officers or employees while 
allowing that such advances could be made to other persons 
working on their behalf (other than Congressional staff or 
relatives). The provisions of the rule would apply to royalties 
received after December 31, 1995.
    Given the time constraints involved with completing the 
business of the session, rather than proceeding with an 
original jurisdiction markup of H. Res. 299, the Rules 
Committee met on December 21, 1995 to consider a special rule 
(H. Res. 322) providing for its consideration. As a result of 
significant concerns raised by Members about the provisions of 
H. Res. 299, the Rules Committee allowed for one motion to 
amend the resolution to be offered by Chairman Solomon.
    The Solomon substitute sought to conform House Rules to 
those applicable in the Executive Branch by prohibiting 
advances but allowing collection of royalties earned under a 
usual and customary contract without limit. As an extra measure 
to ensure compliance with those standards, it required prior 
approval by the Committee on Standards for contracts entered 
into on or after January 1, 1996.
    The House considered H. Res. 299 under the provisions of 
special rule H. Res. 322 on December 22, 1995. The rule was 
adopted by a vote of 380-11. The Solomon substitute passed by a 
vote of 219-174 and H. Res. 299 as amended was then approved by 
a vote of 259-128.
    The new provisions of House Rule XLVII took effect on 
January 1, 1996.

i. Special authorities for Committee on Government Reform and Oversight 
        (H. Res. 369)

    On February 29, 1996, Representative William F. Clinger, 
Jr., chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight, introduced H. Res. 369 to provide his committee with 
special authorities to obtain testimony for purposes of its 
ongoing investigation and study of the White House Travel 
Office matter. The resolution was referred exclusively to the 
Committee on Rules as a matter of original jurisdiction.
    The need for the resolution dated back to the firings of 
seven staff members of the White House Travel Office on May 19, 
1993. A subsequent White House ``management review'' resulted 
in the reprimand of four White House staffers involved in the 
firings on July 2, 1993. At least three other inquiries into 
the firings were conducted by the Justice Department's Office 
of Professional responsibility, the FBI, and the Treasury 
Department's Inspector General.
    During the 103rd Congress, a provision contained in a 
supplemental appropriations bill called for a review of the 
Travel Office matter by the General Accounting Office. Then 
ranking minority member Clinger of the Government Operations 
Committee issued a 71-page minority analysis of the issues 
addressed by the five reports, and called for hearings on the 
matter by his committee. However, no hearings were held during 
the 103rd Congress.
    In the 104th Congress, after months of staff interviews and 
document collection, the Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee began a series of hearings on October 26, 1995, on 
the seven major issues left unresolved by the five reports. 
Following the acquittal of Travel Office Director Billy Dale on 
both charges brought against him, Chairman Clinger requested 
that the public Integrity Section of the Justice Department 
turn over to the committee all documents related to the 
criminal prosecution for review by the Committee. Beginning in 
January of 1996, the Committee proceeded with further hearings 
in the issues raised. However, the Committee continued to meet 
with great difficulty in obtaining necessary testimony and 
information from current and former Administration officials 
and private citizens linked to the Travel Office incident.
    These difficulties led to the introduction of H. Res. 369 
to give the committee special authorities to obtain sworn 
testimony through Member or staff depositions, affidavits and 
interrogatories. Such authority was needed since, under 
existing House Rules, sworn testimony may only be obtained at 
duly constituted committee hearings which require the presence 
of at least two members as a quorum. Without the information 
usually obtained through preliminary staff interviews, such 
hearings are difficult if not impossible to prepare for, 
leaving the committee with the trying task of attempting to 
obtain the most basic information while at the same time 
conducting a productive line of questioning.
    On March 5, 1996, the Rules Committee heard testimony on 
the resolution from Chairman Clinger and Ranking Minority 
Member Cardiss Collins. Following the hearing, the Rules 
Committee proceeded to markup the resolution, and after several 
amendments were rejected on rollcall votes, ordered it reported 
to the House by nonrecord vote, without amendment (H. Rept. 
104-472). The report was filed on March 6, 1996, together with 
minority views.
    The Rules Committee noted in its report its reluctance to 
grant such extraordinary authorities to committees except under 
compelling circumstances and only when the grant of authority 
is investigation-specific. However, based on the facts 
presented to the Rules Committee about circumstances 
surrounding the investigation of the White House Travel Office 
matter, these criteria had been sufficiently proven to warrant 
granting the special authorities.
    As reported, the resolution authorized the chairman of the 
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, upon consultation 
with the ranking minority member, to authorize the taking of 
affidavits, and of depositions, pursuant to notice or subpoena, 
by a member or staff of the committee designated by the 
chairman. The resolution further authorized the chairman to 
require the furnishing of information by interrogatory, under 
oath. The resolution deemed all such testimony to be taken in 
executive session of the committee in Washington, D.C., to be 
considered as nonpublic until received by the committee, but 
permitting it to be used by members of the committee in open 
session unless otherwise directed by the committee.
    On March 7, 1996, H. Res. 369 was considered as a 
privileged matter by the House and, after an hour's debate, was 
adopted by voice vote.

j. Establishing a Select Subcommittee of the International Relations 
        Committee (H. Res. 416)

    H. Res. 416 was introduced by Representative Benjamin 
Gilman on April 29, 1996, and referred to the Committee on 
Rules.
    H. Res. 416 established a select subcommittee of the 
Committee on International Relations to investigate the role of 
the U.S. government in transfers of arms by Iran to Bosnia and 
Croatia during the period when an international arms embargo 
was in effect.
    After Yugoslavia disintegrated and descended into factional 
warfare in June 1991, one of the responses of the international 
community was to impose a United Nations arms embargo on the 
area comprising the entire former nation of Yugoslavia in 
September 1991. The U.N. resolution imposing the embargo passed 
with the support of the U.S. government under the Bush 
administration. That policy was continued under the Clinton 
administration, despite increasing Congressional, media and 
public opposition to the embargo, which was widely seen as 
unfair to the Bosnians.
    However, on April 5, 1996, an article in the Los Angeles 
Times claimed that the Clinton administration had secretly been 
giving its consent to covert arms shipments by Iran to Croatia 
and Bosnia. In testimony before the House International 
Relations Committee on April 23, the basic assertions of the 
article were confirmed by Under secretary of State Peter 
Tarnoff. It was these revelations and the questions they raised 
that prompted the need for H. Res. 416.
    The resolution established the select subcommittee for a 
period not to exceed six months from the date of enactment, by 
which time the subcommittee would submit a report to the full 
committee. The subcommittee was comprised of five majority and 
three minority members of the International Relations Committee 
who were appointed by Chairman Gilman. The resolution deemed 
the subcommittee to be a subcommittee of a standing committee 
of the House for all purposes of law and House rules, including 
the power to sit and act and the power of subpoena, but 
excluding the subcommittee limit for full committees. The 
resolution authorized the chairman of the subcommittee to 
authorize members and staff of the subcommittee to take 
affidavits and depositions pursuant to notice or subpoena.
    H. Res. 416 was reported favorably by the Committee on 
Rules on Wednesday, May 1, 1996, by a vote of 7-4 with no 
amendments. The resolution was considered as a privileged 
resolution in the House on May 8, 1996, and passed by a 
recorded vote of 224-187.

k. United States--Puerto Rico Political Status Act (H.R. 3024)

    H.R. 3024, providing a process leading to full self-
government for Puerto Rico, was introduced by Representative 
Young of Alaska on March 6, 1996, and was referred to the 
Committee on Resources and to the Committee on Rules for a 
period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker.
    The United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act called 
for a referendum on Puerto Rico's political status, in 
accordance with Puerto Rico's electoral law, to be held no 
later than December 31, 1998. The Congressionally defined 
status options of separate sovereignty leading to independence 
or free association, United States sovereignty leading to 
statehood, or the continuation of its present commonwealth 
would be placed on a ballot for approval by majority vote. The 
results of this initial referendum would be presented to 
Congress by the President in the form of transition legislation 
for Congressional approval. The transition legislation would 
then be presented to the people of Puerto Rico for approval. 
Upon approval, the results of this referendum would then be 
presented to Congress by the President in the form of 
implementation legislation for Congressional approval. After 
approval by Congress and the people of Puerto Rico, the new 
status would take effect. H.R. 3024 also authorizes funds for 
holding and conducting the referendums and contains expedited 
procedures for the consideration of transition and 
implementation legislation in both the House and the Senate.
    On June 26, 1996, the Committee on Resources favorably 
reported H.R. 3024, as amended, to the full House. The Rules 
Committee also considered the measure as a matter of original 
jurisdiction. On July 26, 1996, upon the filing of the report 
(H. Rept. 104-713, Part 1) of the Committee on Resources, the 
referral granted to the Rules Committee was limited to a period 
not to exceed September 18, 1996. H.R. 3024 was referred to the 
Rules Committee because the Committee has jurisdiction over 
Section 6 of the legislation (Congressional Procedures for 
Consideration of Legislation), and the matters contained in 
Section 6 are solely within the jurisdiction of the Rules 
Committee.
    On Tuesday, September 17, 1996, the Committee on Rules met 
to hold a hearing on H.R. 3024. The full Committee received 
testimony from Representative Don Young (AK), Representative 
Carlos Romero-Barcelo (PR), Representative Dan Burton (IN), 
Representative Luis Gutierrez (IL), Representative Toby Roth 
(WI), Representative Nydia Velazquez (NY), and Representative 
Jose Serrano (NY). Written testimony was submitted from 
Representative George Miller (CA), Representative Eni F.H. 
Faleomavaega (AS) and Representative Dana Rohrabacher (CA). The 
testimony reflected both bipartisan support and bipartisan 
opposition to the measure.
    On Wednesday, September 18, 1996, the full committee met 
for a markup of H.R. 3024. During the markup, an amendment in 
the nature of a substitute to Section 6 of the bill offered by 
Mr. Dreier (CA) was agreed to that removed procedures from the 
introduced bill which were inconsistent with the stated goals 
of the legislation and normal House procedures. The Committee 
ordered reported H.R. 3024, as amended, by a nonrecord vote. 
The Committee filed its report (H. Rept. 104-713, Part 2) on 
September 18, 1996.
    The Committee on Rules scheduled a hearing for September 
29, 1996, to grant a rule for floor consideration of the 
measure. However, because of a lack of agreement on a 
compromise text, the hearing was canceled. No further action 
was taken on the legislation during the 104th Congress.

                  IV. ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES

           A. Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process

1. Jurisdiction and purpose

    The Committee on Rules first established the Subcommittee 
on the Legislative Process at the beginning of the 96th 
Congress in 1979, and has re-established the subcommittee at 
the beginning of each subsequent Congress. On February 14, 1995 
the Committee changed the name of the Subcommittee to better 
reflect the breadth of its jurisdiction. The Subcommittee on 
Legislative and Budget Process consists of 5 majority (James H. 
Quillen of Tennessee, Porter J. Goss of Florida, John Linder of 
Georgia, Deborah Pryce of Ohio, and Gerald B.H. Solomon of New 
York) and two minority members (Martin Frost of Texas and John 
Joseph Moakley of Massachusetts) and is chaired by Rep. Goss.
    Committee Rule 4(b)(1)(B) assigns to the Subcommittee 
general responsibility for measures or matters pertaining to 
relations between the Congress and the Executive Branch. The 
legislation falling within the Subcommittee's jurisdiction 
includes resolutions and bills. The primary law within the 
Subcommittee's purview continues to be the Congressional Budget 
and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-344) as 
amended. The Subcommittee also claims jurisdiction over budget 
process-related provisions found in Part C of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 
99-177 as amended by Public Laws 100-119, 101-508 and 103-44) 
and the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Title XIII of the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) as amended by the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-44).
    At the outset of the 104th Congress, the Rules Committee 
participated in an exchange of Memoranda of Understanding with 
two other committees having major interest in the Congressional 
budget process--the Government Reform and Oversight Committee 
and the Budget Committee. These agreements were designed to 
clarify jurisdictional issues as set forth in House rule X and 
provide greater understanding of the distinctions in oversight 
authority among the three committees. Through these agreements, 
the Rules Committee retained primary jurisdiction over all 
aspects of the Congressional budget process that are within the 
joint rule making authority of Congress except for budgetary 
terminology and the discretionary spending limits. In 
exercising its jurisdiction, the Subcommittee is responsible 
for conducting ongoing oversight of the Congressional budget 
process.
    The Chairman of the Committee on Rules refers legislation 
to the Subcommittee at his discretion. In previous Congresses, 
a majority of the bills referred were sent to both 
subcommittees through joint referrals. In keeping with the 
decision of the leadership of the 104th Congress to do away 
with joint referrals and streamline the committee process, the 
Committee on Rules made no joint referrals in the 104th 
Congress. 41 bills and resolutions were referred to the 
Subcommittee during this Congress.

2. Summary of activities in the 104th Congress

    The Subcommittee's activities consisted of conducting 
research, holding hearings and assisting the full committee 
with mark-ups and floor management of measures falling within 
its jurisdiction. The results of the Subcommittee's oversight 
activities resulting from the Committee's Oversight Plan will 
be discussed in full detail in the next section. In this 
section the focus is on actions taken that were not directly 
referenced in the Oversight Plan.
            a. Deficit Reduction Lock Box
    A perennial topic of concern for Members on both sides of 
the aisle is attempting to ensure that budget savings are 
``locked in'' for deficit reduction. Members frequently point 
with some frustration to cases where a spending cut amendment 
is adopted by the House or the Senate, but, when the 
appropriation measure in question is complete, the savings from 
that amendment are usually allocated to other programs (or 
sometimes even to the specific program that was initially cut). 
In seeking to address this problem, various so-called ``lock 
box'' proposals have been presented. While the proposals differ 
in their specifics, generally they focus on lowering budget 
caps to ``lock in'' savings.
    On several occasions early in the 104th Congress the House 
addressed lock box issues in the context of both the 
Legislative Line Item Veto and the Emergency Supplemental 
Disaster Assistance and Rescissions Act. In addition, a 
bipartisan group of Members began a campaign to secure lock box 
language to each of the FY '96 Appropriation bills. This 
language generally reflected the text of H.R. 1162, a 
freestanding bipartisan lock box proposal introduced by 
Representative Crapo of Idaho on March 8, 1995. These efforts 
traditionally involved requests to the Rules Committee to allow 
lock box amendments during House consideration of Appropriation 
bills. Given the technical nature of this subject, and serious 
procedural concerns with the proposed lock box language, the 
Rules Committee decided not to allow those amendments, opting 
instead to develop, through the legislative process, a free-
standing lock box proposal.
    Recognizing the shared jurisdiction on budget process 
matters, the Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process and 
the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and 
Technology (of the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight) held a joint hearing on deficit reduction lock box 
proposals on July 11, 1995. Testimony was taken from a 
bipartisan panel of Members, OMB Director Alice Rivlin and CBO 
Deputy Director James Blum. The innovative joint subcommittee 
hearing was chaired by Representative Steve Horn (CA) and held 
in the GROC hearing room.
    Subsequently, on July 20, 1995, the full Rules Committee 
marked up H.R. 1162, adopting a Chairman's mark and several 
technical amendments. The measure that was reported by the 
Committee reflected months of careful technical drafting and 
consultation with a broad range of budget process experts. The 
Subcommittee Chairman and staff worked closely with the full 
Committee to complete this process and develop a workable 
proposal that could garner the support of a strong majority in 
the House.
    The final language sought to ensure that savings would be 
locked in after floor consideration of cutting amendments to 
Appropriation bills, while retaining necessary flexibility for 
House appropriators to conduct their work in conference with 
the Senate. In addition, important issues relating to effective 
dates, the discretionary spending levels and maintaining the 
lock box ledger were addressed.
    Both the Government Reform and Oversight Committee and the 
Budget Committee waived jurisdiction, allowing the Deficit 
Reduction Lock Box approved by the Rules Committee to proceed 
to the floor. Ultimately the lock box measure was passed by the 
House on three separate occasions: as an amendment to the FY 
'96 Labor, HHS and Education Appropriation Bill on August 4, 
1995; as a freestanding measure (H.R. 1162 as reported by the 
Rules Committee) on September 13, 1995; and as an amendment to 
the Omnibus Appropriation Bill on March 7, 1996. It passed with 
broad bipartisan support on all three occasions.

            d. Subcommittee homepage
    As part of ``Cyber Congress 2000,'' the Subcommittee 
launched an ambitious Web site, which can be found at: [http://
www.house.gov/rules__bud/homenew.html]. This site is designed 
to introduce people to the subcommittee members and its 
jurisdiction, as well as offer them an interesting and useful 
guide to the Congressional Budget Process.

    See Section V.

3. Assisting the full Committee

    In addition to the work outlined above on the Deficit 
Reduction Lock Box, the Subcommittee Members and staff assisted 
the Committee in several important original jurisdiction 
projects, most notably completion and enactment of the Line 
Item Veto.
    H.R. 2, the Line Item Veto Act, was referred sequentially 
to the Rules Committee because of its section on expedited 
procedures for Congressional consideration of line item vetoes 
by the President. The Committee held an informal briefing and 
then a subsequent markup to fulfill its jurisdictional 
responsibilities. Subcommittee Chairman Goss and the 
Subcommittee staff assisted the Chairman and Committee staff in 
this process and in managing the bill on the House floor. In 
addition, the Subcommittee played an active role in the ensuing 
conference with the Senate to ensure that the critical elements 
of a true line item veto were not lost in the negotiation.
    In the end, the conference agreed to a real, effective and 
workable line item veto proposal, that becomes a new Part C of 
Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act, which the President signed on April 9, 1996. The Line Item 
Veto is effective as of January 1, 1997.
    The Subcommittee also provided assistance to the full 
Committee in its work on H. Res. 250, the new House Gift Rule, 
both in terms of staff support and employing Chairman Goss as a 
liaison with the Rules Committee and the Committee on 
Standards, of which he is also a member, to ensure availability 
of the necessary technical expertise.
    Finally, the Subcommittee provided support for the full 
Committee in its work on H. Res. 299, amending House rule XLVII 
regarding book royalties and restrictions on outside earned 
income.

5. Subcommittee publications

    During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee published one 
document in conjunction with the Subcommittee on Rules and 
Organization of the House: Hearings on Reviewing and Studying 
on a Continuing Basis, the Congressional Budget Process. Three 
additional joint subcommittee hearings held on ``Building on 
Change: Preparing for the 105th Congress'' were published as a 
full Committee document.

6. Outlook for the 105th Congress

    The Subcommittee looks forward to building on the 
foundation it established in several issue areas, most notably 
budget process and ethics process. It is the intention of the 
Subcommittee to work with the other committees with 
jurisdiction over the budget process to consider and recommend 
ways to reform the budget process to make it more accountable, 
understandable and enforceable. Specifically the Subcommittee 
hopes to see implementation of the Deficit Reduction Lock Box 
as a meaningful tool to enforce spending cut decisions made by 
the membership. The Subcommittee also intends to play a role in 
reviewing and revising the current ethics process. Finally, the 
Subcommittee expects to conduct active oversight into the 
implementation of the Line Item Veto Act, which takes effect on 
January 1, 1997.

         B. Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House

1. Jurisdiction and purpose

    The Subcommittee was first established at the beginning of 
the 96th Congress as the Subcommittee on Rules of the House. At 
the beginning of the 104th Congress, Representative David 
Dreier of California became only the third chairman of the 
subcommittee and its name was changed to the Subcommittee on 
Rules and Organization of the House to better reflect the 
Subcommittee's mission and areas of jurisdiction. The other 
Members of the subcommittee are: Representative Lincoln Diaz-
Balart of Florida, the subcommittee vice chairman; 
Representative Scott McInnis of Colorado; Representative Enid 
Greene of Utah; Representative Gerald Solomon of New York; 
Representative Anthony Beilenson of California, the ranking 
minority member; and Representative Tony Hall of Ohio.
    The Subcommittee has general responsibility for measures or 
matters related to relations between the two Houses of 
Congress, relations between Congress and the Judiciary, and 
internal operations of the House. The Subcommittee is primarily 
responsible for the continuing examination of the committee 
structure and jurisdictional issues. In recent years, the 
Subcommittee has considered measures dealing with ``fast 
track'' procedures for trade legislation, and has examined 
commemorative legislation, the motion to recommit, and the 
creation of select committees.
    The Subcommittee is also committed to a continuing study of 
the organization and operations of the House following up on 
the work of the 1993 Joint Committee on the Organization of 
Congress. The Joint Committee was charged with undertaking a 
comprehensive review of the organization and operations of the 
legislative branch. It held 36 hearings and took testimony from 
243 witnesses--including 133 House Members, 37 Senators, 14 
former Members, 15 current and former staff members, and 44 
outside witnesses. It organized symposiums, conducted surveys, 
contracted outside studies, and consulted with congressional 
scholars, academics and the public. In the end, the Joint 
Committee compiled the largest information data base ever 
assembled on the problems with the institution and options for 
reforming the Congress.
    Referral of legislation to the Subcommittee is at the 
discretion of the chairman of the Committee on Rules. 61 bills 
and resolutions were referred to the Subcommittee during the 
104th Congress.

2. Summary of activities

            a. Corrections Day
    On Tuesday, May 2, 1995, the Subcommittee on Rules and 
Organization of the House of the Committee on Rules and the 
Subcommittee on National Economic Growth, Natural Resources and 
Regulatory Affairs of the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight held a joint hearing on House Speaker Newt Gingrich's 
proposal to create a Corrections Day in the House of 
Representatives specifically for correcting legislative and 
regulatory mistakes. The hearing focused on the nature and 
scope of the problem to be addressed by Corrections Day, and 
examined procedural options to facilitate a Corrections Day 
process.
    In his statement before the joint subcommittees on May 2, 
the Speaker outlined three objectives for the Corrections Day 
process: (1) to create a better balance between bureaucrats and 
citizens; (2) to set a standard of common sense by ``bringing 
up the dumbest things and repealing them''; and (3) to enhance 
Congressional oversight over federal agencies.
    On March 23, 1995, the Speaker Gingrich appointed a 
Corrections Day Steering Group consisting of Representatives 
Barbara Vucanovich, Bill Zeliff, and David McIntosh to develop 
a framework for the consideration of corrections measures. The 
steering group recommended establishing a ``Corrections 
Calendar'' to facilitate the consideration of Corrections Day 
measures. On Tuesday, June 6, 1995, Representative Barbara 
Vucanovich introduced H. Res. 161, amending clause 4 of rule 
XIII of the Rules of the House to abolish the Consent Calendar 
and to establish in its place a Corrections Calendar. 
Information regarding full committee consideration of H. Res. 
161 is contained in Section III (C)(2)(c) of this report.
    Following the establishment of a Corrections Calendar, the 
Speaker established a 12-member bipartisan Corrections Day 
Advisory Group consisting of Representative Barbara Vucanovich 
of Nevada, who served as chairman; Representative David 
McIntosh of Indiana and Representative Bill Zeliff of New 
Hampshire, who served as co-chairmen; Representative Gerald 
Solomon of New York; Representative David Dreier of California; 
Representative Sam Johnson of Texas; Representative Robert 
Ehrlich of Maryland; Representative Collin Peterson of 
Minnesota; Representative Gary Condit of California; 
Representative Henry Waxman of California; Representative 
Xavier Becerra of California; and Representative Lynn Rivers of 
Michigan.
    According to the Corrections Day Advisory Group, 20 bills 
have been considered in this Congress on the House Floor under 
the Corrections Day process. The process had yielded 15 public 
laws and one veto. Four bills passed the House only and were 
not considered in the Senate. The Advisory Group considered a 
total of 33 bills. According to the Advisory Group, eight of 
the bills that were considered by the Advisory Group and the 
problems they addressed were either fixed by the executive 
branch or passed the House in another form.
    During a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Rules and 
Organization of the House and the Subcommittee on Legislative 
and Budget Process on September 12, 1996, the Chairman of the 
Corrections Day Advisory Group, Representative Barbara 
Vucanovich, recommended three changes to the Corrections 
Calendar rule would provide flexibility for Floor management: 
(1) allow the Speaker to call bills on the Corrections Calendar 
out of numerical order to accommodate the manager or sponsor of 
the bill; (2) allow intervening businesses, between the Pledge 
of Allegiance and the call of the Corrections Calendar, to give 
the Speaker the authority to consider business before the 
Corrections Calendar; and (3) allow recorded votes on an 
amendment or recommittal to be postponed by the Speaker until 
the next day.
            b. Fast track
    See Section V.
            c. Budget process
    See Section V.
            d. Task Force on Committee Review
    The Subcommittee was asked to provide counsel to the 
members of the Task Force on Committee Review. The Task Force 
was created by the House Republican Conference to undertake a 
comprehensive review of the committee system in the House of 
Representatives in an effort to: (1) assess the effectiveness 
of the committee reforms adopted on the opening day of the 
104th Congress, and (2) make further recommendations for 
change.
    On July 16, 1996, the Task Force issued a comprehensive 
report calling for increased public access to legislative 
information over the Internet and proposing new procedures for 
managing committee meetings, reporting bills and conducting 
investigative oversight. Task Force recommendations that are in 
the general purview of the Committee on Rules include:
          Increasing public access to committee documents over 
        the Internet;
          Creating ad hoc committees on an experimental basis;
          Expanding committee oversight tools;
          Making management audits available to committees;
          Creating a parliamentary training program for 
        committee staff;
          Recodifying House rules;
          Permitting audio/visual participation at committee 
        hearings;
          Modifying the five-minute rule for investigative 
        hearings;
          Utilizing alternative hearing formats;
          Streamlining compliance with voting records;
          Eliminating inflationary impact statements;
          Requiring statements of performance goals and 
        criteria;
          Permitting joint filing of certain committee reports;
          Making additional subcommittee reductions;
          Including the Appropriations Committee in the 
        biennial committee funding process;
          Enforcing assignment limitation rules;
          Repealing the limitation on committees sitting during 
        the five-minute rule; and strengthening the ethics 
        process.
    Representatives of the Task Force on Committee Review 
appeared before a joint hearing of the Subcommittee on Rules 
and Organization of the House and the Subcommittee on 
Legislative and Budget Process on July 24, 1996 (See Section 
V).
            e. 21st Century Congress Project
    In the 104th Congress, aggressive efforts were made to 
bring Congress up-to-date in the use of information 
technologies as quickly as possible to make the institution 
more effective and to facilitate public participation in the 
legislative process. The THOMAS system at the Library of 
Congress was founded on January 1, 1995, and it has been 
successful in delivering basic legislative information, 
including the Congressional Record and texts of bills and 
resolutions. In 1996, THOMAS was upgraded to provide an 
expanded list of documents, including access to committee 
information such as bill reports and testimony, and to simplify 
information retrieval. THOMAS continues to grow and improve as 
institutional barriers to the production and retrieval of 
electronic documents are removed.
    By the end of the 104th Congress, 164 House Members were 
participating in the U.S. House of Representatives constituent 
electronic mail system, and 207 Members and 18 standing 
committees have World Wide Web sites on the Internet. This is 
in stark contrast to the beginning of the Congress, when only 
51 House Members had e-mail addresses and there were no 
committee Web sites. Today every House committee has the 
capability to provide immediate online access to legislative 
documents, transcripts, schedules and other information.
    The House also established a plan, known as ``Cyber 
Congress 2000,'' which envisions a modern Congress utilizing 
state-of-the-art communication, networking, and computing 
technologies that will dramatically improve the work of Members 
and committees. This enhanced infrastructure, which will 
require a number of years to fully deploy, will provide Members 
and the public with more comprehensive and accurate information 
regarding the status and content of bills and related 
legislative activities.
    In an effort to begin assessing the procedural and 
organizational implications of technology use by Congress, the 
Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House has 
undertaken ``The 21st Century Congress Project.'' The goal of 
the project is to develop and recommend changes in Congress' 
operations and legislative procedures that will allow 
technology to make the institution more open, accountable and 
effective. To encourage public input and participation in the 
project, the Subcommittee established a Web site on the 
Internet at the following address: [http://www.house.gov/
rules__org/21home.html].
    In conjunction with the establishment of the Web site, the 
Subcommittee on May 24, 1996, held an interactive hearing 
entitled ``Legislating in the 21st Century Congress'' to assess 
the potential implications of future technology utilization on 
the legislative process in the House, while showcasing some of 
the practical applications of those technologies. The 
Subcommittee utilized video conference technology to allow 
participation by one witness and one Subcommittee member, as 
well as C-SPAN and the Internet to permit indirect 
participation by the public.

4. Subcommittee publications

    In the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee printed two 
documents: (1) hearing on ``Legislating in the 21st Century 
Congress;'' and (2) hearings on ``Building on Change: Preparing 
for the 105th Congress.'' The Committee on Government Reform 
and Oversight published a document on a joint hearing before 
the Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House and the 
Subcommittee on National Economic Growth, Natural Resources, 
and Regulatory Affairs regarding Corrections Day Policy and 
Procedures. The Committee on Ways and Means also published a 
document on joint hearings before the Subcommittee on Rules and 
Organization of the House and the Subcommittee on Trade 
focusing on the policy, conditions, and negotiating objectives 
of fast track.

5. Outlook for the 105th Congress

    a. Review of 105th Congress ``Opening Day'' reforms--In the 
event that the House of Representatives approves additional 
significant changes in House Rules, the Subcommittee expects to 
take an active review of those changes to ensure their 
effectiveness.
    b. Technology and Congress--The work begun in the 104th 
Congress merely began laying the foundation for a long-term 
examination of this issue by the Subcommittee. That Congress 
will be fully integrated with the rest of the nation 
technologically within a few short years is not in question. 
What is less certain is how technology will transform the 
culture, operations, and responsibilities of Congress, and what 
it will mean for our Federal system of representative 
government.
    c. Fast Track--The Subcommittee expects to continue 
examining the major procedural issues concerning fast track; in 
particular the treatment of revenue provisions of trade 
agreement implementing bills, extraneous issues included in 
trade agreement implementing bills, the submission of proposed 
agreement and required legislative changes by the 
administration, and time periods for committee and floor 
review.

            V. COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT PLANS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS

                 A. Summary of Committee Oversight Plan

    As part of the opening day reforms for the 104th Congress, 
the House adopted a new rule requiring each committee to file 
oversight plans with the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight. This new requirement is found in clause 2(d) of rule 
X. Moreover, clause 1(d) of rule XI requires committees to 
publish a separate oversight section in their final activity 
reports summarizing their originally adopted oversight plans, a 
summary of actions and recommendations taken pursuant to those 
plans, and any additional oversight activities undertaken and 
recommendations made during the Congress.
    In fulfilling its obligation under the new rule, the Rules 
Committee met on February 14, 1995, and approved by voice vote 
an ambitious oversight plan for the Congress.
    Among the objectives the Committee outlined for its 
oversight efforts was to play a central role in continuing 
efforts to reform the structure of the House and refine the 
processes by which the nation's business is conducted here. The 
Committee expressed its intention to be proactive in this 
effort, pursuing matters of original jurisdiction and using the 
two subcommittees to fulfill its general oversight 
responsibilities as outlined in rule X.

a. The Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House

    The Subcommittee included among the areas of focus for 
oversight the following:
          Review of the Opening Day Reforms contained in H. 
        Res. 6
          Review of committees' rules in the context of House 
        rules
          Continued review of proposals made by the JCOC
          Monitor and review of the work of the Task Force on 
        Committee Review
          Continued review of the amendment process and efforts 
        to enhance access to legislative information
          Review of efforts to improve the family-friendly 
        quality of the House
          Review of fast track trade procedures under Section 
        151 of the Trade Act of 1974

b. The Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process

    The Subcommittee included among the areas of focus for 
oversight the following:
          Review and recommend changes in the Congressional 
        Budget Process
          Review the process by which the House conducts its 
        oversight of intelligence activities and maintains the 
        security of classified information
          Review the structure and workings of the Ethics 
        Process as outlined in Rule X
          Provide general oversight as needed over 
        implementation of H.R. 5 (Unfunded Mandates) and H.R. 2 
        (Line Item Veto)
          Explore areas for review within the general framework 
        of relations between the Legislative and Executive 
        Branches of government

           B. Summary of Committee Oversight Accomplishments

    The Committee succeeded in meeting most of the goals it set 
for itself in its oversight plan, while taking leading roles in 
implementing two major pieces of legislation (Unfunded Mandate 
Reform and the Line Item Veto), development of a third (the 
Deficit Reduction Lock Box), and making several important 
internal changes (including the Corrections Calendar, the House 
Gift Ban and Book Contracts).

a. Budget process

    Working together, the two subcommittees took the lead in 
reviewing the Congressional budget process, fulfilling the 
Committee's responsibility as outlined in House rule X, clause 
3. After an informal CRS briefing for Members and staff, three 
joint subcommittee hearings were held in 1995, at which Members 
and outside witnesses (including CBO Director June O'Neill and 
several Congressional scholars) testified in response to broad 
questions about the goals and the effectiveness of the current 
budget process.
    Witnesses who testified at the three hearings (held on July 
13, July 19 and September 13) were all asked to consider what 
were the objectives of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act, 
whether those objectives are still relevant in today's fiscal 
environment and whether the process should be redesigned (and, 
if so, how).
    In total, the two subcommittees heard testimony from 8 
Members and 8 outside experts.
    It is the Committee's intention that this initial review 
should provide the foundation for continued work on the subject 
of the budget process in the 105th Congress, leading up to 
recommendations for revisions that could be implemented in the 
coming two years.

b. Internal reform

    The oversight plan of the Committee on Rules calls for a 
comprehensive review of the organizational and procedural 
reforms adopted by the House on January 4, 1995. To assist in 
fulfilling these oversight objectives, the Subcommittee 
majority staff met with more than 50 principal leadership, 
committee, administrative and support staff in the House to 
assess the effectiveness of the opening day reforms as well as 
reforms subsequently approved by the House. The meetings also 
sought to identify additional issues that may require further 
scrutiny by the Rules Committee.
    Interviews were conducted with leadership staff in the 
offices of the Speaker, Majority Leader, Majority Whip, 
Republican Conference, and Republican Policy Committee; 
majority floor staff; majority staff directors and counsels of 
every standing committee; officials in the Office of the 
Parliamentarian, Office of Legislative Counsel, Clerk of the 
House, and the Congressional Budget Office; and former 
Republican leadership staff and academic experts. The 
interviews were conducted over a 4 month period in late 1995 
and early 1996.
    The staff interviews covered a broad range of subjects, 
including scheduling; the leadership's planning and agenda-
setting process; innovative rules; committee procedures, 
staffing and oversight; the appropriations process and 
procedures; the congressional budget process; and 
administration of the House.
    In July 1996, Chairman Solomon launched an unprecedented 
bi-partisan review process for the Committee to take input from 
Members and outside experts about how to build on the historic 
rules changes of the 104th Congress and prepare for the 105th 
Congress.
    Beginning with a Members' Open Day hearing before the Full 
Committee, this project marked the first time in recent memory 
that planning for the next Congress' internal rules was subject 
to bipartisan, public commentary. In his announcement of this 
project, Chairman Solomon said ``We're still committed to 
changing the way Congress does business. There are many Members 
with good ideas on how to conduct the people's business more 
efficiently and we're going to give them a good look.''
     The Members' Open Day was held on July 17, 1996 and 
included the testimony of 16 Members, including 6 Republicans 
and 10 Democrats. Proposals for reform ranged from changes 
designed to improve civility in the House to modifications of 
the Ethics Process.
     Once the Committee launched this project, Chairman Solomon 
tasked the two subcommittees with continuing the review. Three 
additional joint subcommittee hearings were held on this topic 
with the focus on organized reform efforts underway during the 
104th Congress. The joint subcommittee hearings were held on 
July 24, 1996, September 5, 1996 and September 11, 1996. In 
all, the joint subcommittees heard testimony from 23 Members 
representing both sides of the aisle (including the Task Force 
on Committee Review, the Bipartisan Reform Team, the Democratic 
Caucus Committee on Organization, Study and Review, the 
Corrections Day Advisory Group and the Family Quality of Life 
Advisory Committee) and 3 Congressional scholars.
     On July 10, 1996, in conjunction with the joint 
subcommittee hearings, the Rules Committee sent questionnaires 
to all House committee chairmen and ranking minority members 
soliciting their views on various House reforms adopted at the 
beginning of the 104th Congress and proposals for further 
changes. Eighteen members responded, including 13 chairmen and 
5 ranking minority members. The results of the survey were 
subsequently published as a committee print.
     The fact that this unprecedented formal, bipartisan review 
process was undertaken is itself a testament to the degree of 
change that has occurred with the new majority in the historic 
104th Congress. The Committee found this exercise to be most 
helpful in its effort to develop suggestions for the leadership 
about additional Congressional reforms to be implemented at the 
outset of the 105th Congress. It is the intention of the 
Committee to continue this practice in future Congresses.

c. Ethics process (House Rule X(4)(e))

     The Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process moved 
forward with plans to conduct a formal review of the ethics 
process as established in House Rule X(4)(e). In the early 
months of 1995, staff began a review process with CRS experts 
and others and on May 18, 1995, the Subcommittee held an 
informal briefing for Members and staff with three state ethics 
experts (representing Florida, Ohio and California), all of 
whom belong to an organization known as the Council on 
Governmental Ethics Laws (COGEL).
     Subcommittee Chairman Goss began laying the groundwork for 
formal hearings, however after consultation with the Ranking 
Member, decided on several occasions to postpone the formal 
review. As a result of repeated, direct requests by the 
minority, the Subcommittee opted not to proceed with hearings, 
instead choosing to continue its assessment of the ethics 
process through the more general reform process discussed 
above. However, it has become clear to many Members on both 
sides of the aisle that the ethics process is in need of reform 
and it is the strong intention of the Committee that a review 
culminating in changes to the process should occur as early as 
possible in the 105th Congress.

d. Intelligence Oversight (House Rule XLVIII)

     Throughout the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee on 
Legislative and Budget Process worked with CRS and the House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) to fulfill 
its commitment to reviewing the process of Intelligence 
Oversight in the House.
     Although specific hearings on this subject were not held 
separately, it was included as an agenda item in the second 
joint subcommittee hearing on reform. Testimony was taken from 
HPSCI Chairman Larry Combest regarding proposals made in his 
committee's staff study (known as IC 21) regarding the 
structure and composition of HPSCI. In addition, CRS provided 
the Subcommittee with several reports on this subject, focusing 
on the pros and cons of tenure limits, cross-over requirements 
and establishing a joint House-Senate oversight committee.

e. Fast track

     The Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House 
and the Subcommittee on Trade of the Ways and Means Committee 
held joint hearings on May 11 and May 17, 1995, on fast track 
issues. The May 11 hearing focused on policy, conditions, and 
negotiating objectives of fast track. The May 17 hearing 
focused on fast track procedures.
            1. Fast track background
     Procedures providing expedited consideration for 
legislation implementing trade agreements, commonly referred to 
as ``fast track,'' are the most recent congressional-executive 
innovations to facilitate Congress' long-standing policy of 
seeking trade benefits through reciprocal trade negotiations. 
As early as 1890, Congress delegated tariff bargaining 
authority to the President. In the Reciprocal Trade Agreements 
Act of 1934, Congress authorized the President to enter into 
reciprocal tariff agreements with foreign countries and, within 
a designated range, to proclaim tariffs needed to implement 
those agreements without subsequent congressional approval.
     The reciprocal tariff authority delegated to the President 
in 1934 was used by the President to enter into 32 bilateral 
reciprocal trade agreements by 1945 and continued to be the 
basis of U.S. trade negotiations through the mid-1970s. 
Throughout this time, federal courts have acknowledged that not 
all international undertakings of the United States are 
concluded as treaties and that congressional-executive trade 
agreements could find a constitutional basis in the joint 
exercise of Congress' tariff and commerce authorities and the 
President's foreign policy power.
     As the parties to the General Agreements on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) began to negotiate more extensively to eliminate 
nontariff trade barriers in a number of areas, Congress enacted 
legislation that would provide the President with negotiating 
credibility and ensure that Congress carried out its 
constitutional responsibilities regarding legislative 
implementation of the agreements. In the Trade Act of 1974, 
Congress provided the President with new authority to negotiate 
multilateral trade agreements, allowing him to continue to 
proclaim tariff reductions and modifications but requiring him 
to submit nontariff barrier agreements to Congress, which would 
vote on approval of the agreements and on legislation necessary 
or appropriate to implement them. The consultation and 
notification requirements prior to entry into an agreement and 
introduction of an implementing bill ensured that Congressional 
views and recommendations with respect to provisions of the 
proposed agreement and possible changes in U.S. law or 
administrative practice were fully taken into account and any 
problems resolved in advance of formal Congressional action. At 
the same time, the process was designed to ensure certain and 
expeditious action on the results of the negotiation and on the 
implementing bill with no amendments.
     The ``fast track'' procedure authorized in the Trade Act 
of 1974 was first used with respect to the GATT Tokyo Round 
Agreements, which were approved and implemented in the Trade 
Agreements Act of 1979. The expedited procedures for the 
implementation of multilateral trade agreements have not been 
significantly altered since 1974. Extended through section 
1102(c) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, 
and modified to authorize the President to enter into bilateral 
trade agreements, fast track procedures were most recently used 
to implement the Uruguay Round Agreements of GATT and the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). That fast track 
negotiating authority applied only with respect to new 
agreements entered into before December 15, 1993.
     In 1995, the Administration began negotiations with Chile 
as to possible accession to the NAFTA. Because the fast track 
authority used for the NAFTA has expired, the Committees are 
now considering the extension of additional fast track 
authority.
            2. Negotiating authority
     Section 1102(c) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness 
Act of 1988, now expired, set forth three requirements for the 
negotiation of a bilateral agreement:
          The foreign country must request the negotiation of 
        the bilateral agreement;
          The agreement must make progress in meeting 
        applicable U.S. trade negotiating objectives; and
          The President was required to provide written notice 
        of the negotiations to the Committee on Ways and Means 
        and the Senate Committee on Finance and consult with 
        these committees. The negotiations could proceed unless 
        either Committee disapproved the negotiations within 60 
        calendar days prior to the 90 calendar day advance 
        notice required of entry into an agreement (described 
        below).
     Any agreement negotiated under section 1102 was required 
to make progress in meeting the applicable objectives set forth 
in section 1101. The overall objectives were to obtain more 
open, equitable, and reciprocal market access, the reduction or 
elimination of barriers and other trade-distorting policies and 
practices, and a more effective system of international trading 
disciplines and procedures. In addition, section 108 of the 
NAFTA Implementation Act sets forth congressional intent and 
preliminary procedures for negotiating future free trade 
agreements and accession to the NAFTA.
            3. Fast track procedures
     Section 102 of the Trade Act of 1974 and sections 1102(d) 
and 1103 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 
set forth the fast track requirements. These provisions 
required the President, before entering into any trade 
agreement, to consult with Congress as to the nature of the 
agreement, how and to what extent the agreement will achieve 
applicable purposes, policies, and objectives, and all matters 
relating to agreement implementation. In addition, before 
entering into an agreement, the President was required to give 
Congress at least 90 calendar days advance notice of his 
intent. The purpose of this period was to provide the 
Congressional committees of jurisdiction an opportunity to 
review the proposed agreement before it was signed, to 
determine the changes in U.S. laws that would be necessary or 
appropriate to implement the obligations under the agreement, 
and to meet with Administration officials to develop the text 
of an acceptable implementing bill.
    After entering into the agreement, the President was 
required to submit formally the draft agreement, implementing 
legislation, and a statement of administrative action. Once the 
bill was formally introduced, there was no opportunity to amend 
any portion of the bill--whether on the floor or in committee. 
Consequently, before the formal introduction took place, the 
committees of jurisdiction would hold ``mock hearings'' and 
``mock mark-up'' sessions in order to consider legislation 
informally circulated by the Administration and to make their 
concerns known to the Administration before it introduced the 
legislation formally.
    After formal introduction of the implementing bill, the 
House committees of jurisdiction had 45 days to report the 
bill, and the House was required to vote on the bill within 15 
legislative days after the measure was reported or discharged 
from the committees. Fifteen additional days were provided for 
Senate committee consideration (assuming the implementing bill 
was a revenue bill), and the Senate floor action was required 
within 15 additional days. Accordingly, the maximum period for 
Congressional consideration of an implementing bill from the 
date of introduction was 90 days. Amendments to the legislation 
were not permitted once the bill was introduced; the committee 
and floor actions consisted of ``up or down'' votes on the bill 
as introduced.
            4. Policy issues concerning fast track
    Broad versus narrow: This issue relates to whether fast 
track authority should be broad and open-ended so that it 
covers all trade agreements entered into within a specific 
period of time, or whether it should be limited to negotiations 
with particular countries or regions. More specifically, 
although the Administration is beginning NAFTA-accession issues 
with Chile, it may later begin negotiations with other Latin 
American countries, as well as APEC countries. The fast track 
authority could cover all of these negotiations or could be 
more limited.
    Labor and environment negotiating objectives: The 
Administration has pressed for inclusion of negotiating 
objectives relating to environmental standards and seeks to 
broaden such objectives relating to labor standards. The 
Republican leadership and many business interests have opposed 
these objectives, stating that they are not trade related and 
that the overall benefits of trade agreements serve to improve 
labor and environmental conditions.
    Time period: An open issue relates to the length of time 
provided for fast track authority as well as whether there will 
be any extensions permitted. The general consensus has been for 
a period of four to six years.
            5. Major procedural issues concerning fast track
    Treatment of revenue provisions of trade agreement 
implementing bills: The ``Pay-Go'' provisions of the 1990 
Budget Agreement have been applied to implementing legislation 
for two trade agreements--the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the GATT Uruguay Round. ``Pay-Go'' rules require 
the estimated five-year reduction in tariff revenues to be 
fully offset with provisions increasing revenue or reducing 
entitlement spending. These provisions have nearly all been 
nontax revenue-raising measures, generally totally unrelated to 
trade. The inclusion of non-trade revenue provisions in an 
unamendable legislative vehicle has caused concerns in both 
Houses of Congress, and among many private sector groups.
    Extraneous issues included in trade agreement implementing 
bills: Fast track procedures have permitted implementing 
legislation to include provisions that are ``necessary and 
appropriate'' to implement the trade agreement. The NAFTA and 
Uruguay Round implementing bills included numerous provisions 
which were clearly not necessary to implement the respective 
agreements. These included non-trade revenue provisions 
included to satisfy the 1990 Budget Agreement as well as some 
trade provisions not required by the agreements.
    Submission of proposed agreement and required legislative 
changes by the administration: Fast track procedures have 
required the Administration to notify the House Ways and Means 
Committee and the Senate Finance Committee of its intent to 
enter into an agreement 90 days before such action. Congress 
has not always received a copy of the draft agreement during 
that time, restricting its ability to recommend modifications 
before the agreement is finalized. In addition, after an 
agreement is entered into, the Administration has not been 
required to submit a list of the statutory changes to law 
required to implement the agreement.
    Time periods for committee and floor review: Fast track 
procedures have placed generous time limits on committee and 
floor consideration of trade agreement implementing 
legislation. However, there is some question as to the need for 
lengthy time limits at these final stages in the process as the 
legislation is unamendable at that point. On the other hand, 
there are no time limits requiring the Administration to send 
implementing legislation to Congress after entering into a 
trade agreement. Absent a time limit, the legislative drafting 
and ``mock mark-up'' period has encompassed many months for 
recent trade bills.
            6. Legislative action in the 104th Congress
    On September 9, 1995, Representative Bill Archer, chairman 
of the Committee on Ways and Means, along with Representative 
Phil Crane and Representative David Dreier, introduced H.R. 
2371, the Trade Agreements Authority Act of 1995, to provide 
trade agreements authority to the President. The measure was 
referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee 
on Rules. On January 3, 1996, H.R. 2371 was referred to the 
Subcommittee on Rules and Organization of the House.
    The Committee on Ways and Means held a mark up on H.R. 2371 
on September 21, 1995, and ordered the measure reported with 
amendments (House Report 104-285, Part I). The Rules Committee 
deferred action on H.R. 2371 pending the outcome of 
negotiations with the Clinton administration on amendments to 
the bill as reported by the Ways and Means Committee. However, 
such an agreement was not reached prior to adjournment of the 
104th Congress.

                            ADDITIONAL VIEWS

    While some of the procedural changes the Republican 
majority instituted during this Congress are commendable, their 
record is not so successful as this survey suggests.
    In our view, the majority fell far short of the goals they 
expressed at the beginning of this Congress. They said that 70 
percent of rules issued by the Committee would be open; 
instead, less than 45 percent were open. They made a commitment 
to preserve and expand the minority's rights to offer a motion 
to recommit; instead, they found new ways to restrict that 
right.
    The majority also claimed they would not use the new 
unfunded mandates point of order in ways other than for which 
it was explicitly intended, but the first time it was invoked, 
it was used to block consideration of a minority motion to 
recommit, even though the motion contained no mandate, as the 
Congressional Budget Office confirmed.
    In addition, the majority said they would try never to 
waive all points of order, but the Committee reported more than 
100 rules containing such blanket waivers. The majority said 
that they would not invoke ``martial law''--a special rule 
allowing rules to be brought up without the usual one-day 
layover--yet kept the House under martial law for the longest 
extended period in history.
    Three new House rules established by the Republican 
majority were routinely waived. One was the \3/5\ vote 
requirement for any measure increasing income taxes, which was 
waived for every measure where it potentially applied. A second 
was the rule prohibiting committees from conducting business 
while the House was in the Committee of the Whole; that rule 
was waived more than 950 times. The third was the rule limiting 
Members to no more than two standing committee and four 
subcommittee assignments; at the end of the 104th Congress, 41 
Republican Members exceed the two-committee limit and 30 
exceeded the four-subcommittee limit.
    These views explain in detail the ways in which the 
Republican majority failed to meet the procedural standards 
they set for the House during the 104th Congress.

                     openness vs. restrictive rules

    On January 5, 1995, Chairman Solomon said, ``I have been 
instructed by our new Speaker Gingrich . . . He has instructed 
me to try to have open rules and fair rules be the norm of this 
Congress . . . 70 percent of the rules in the 103rd Congress 
were restricted or closed rules. We are going to try to turn 
that around . . . I am going to pledge to try to turn this 
around: Instead of having 70 percent closed rules and 
restricted rules, we are going to have 70 percent open and 
unrestricted rules, if we possibly can.'' [January 5, 1995, 
Congressional Record, H134, H135, H137].
    Using their own definition of open, less than 45 percent of 
the rules reported from the Rules Committee were open, far 
short of their 70 percent goal. We disagree with their 
definitions but even on their own terms, they failed.
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    The chart above demonstrates that Republicans failed to 
make more than a modest improvement. In fact, the small gain in 
the percentage of open rules is accounted for by the use of 
three parliamentary ruses used to push some closed rules off 
the chart and to include some questionable open rules on the 
chart:
    (1) a handful of closed rules were adopted by the House but 
were not reported by the Committee on Rules and, therefore, do 
not count in these statistics. Examples include: (1) H.Res. 6 
adopted on opening day (before the Committee on Rules had 
organized) which contained a completely closed rule for 
consideration of H.R. 1 and (2) a time cap rule for 
consideration of H.R. 729, adopted by the House but not 
reported from the Committee.
    (2) a handful of open rules were reported to provide for 
consideration of measures that were debated briefly and then 
adopted either by voice vote or by recorded vote with more than 
\2/3\ voting aye. These are added to the chart even though such 
measures would ordinarily be considered on the suspension 
calendar, and we suspect the Committee granted open rules only 
in order to pad the Committee's statistics. Examples include: 
H.R. 101, passed by voice vote immediately after adoption of 
the committee amendment (a version of the bill as amended could 
have been considered under suspension of the rules), H.R. 400, 
passed without amendment by a vote of 427 to 0, and, H.R. 440, 
passed by voice vote without amendment.
    (3) some open rules were reported and adopted by the House 
even though the majority later changed the terms of debate to 
consider the measures under restrictive floor procedures. 
Chairman Solomon's memo below explains this strange alchemy--
how to transform an open rule into one that limits the offering 
of amendments--and suggests that it be used more often: The 
rules in this third category are all treated as open rules in 
our statistics.
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    In the beginning of the 104th Congress a Roll Call headline 
stated Chairman Solomon Says He plans to Grant Open Rules on 75 
Percent of Bills Next Year.\1\ On January 5th Chairman Solomon 
stated on the Floor ``I am going to say to you now, today we 
are shooting to have 70 percent of those rules open so that as 
the minority and even the majority Members over here will have 
the right to work their will on the floor of this Congress.'' 
We were encouraged by Mr. Solomon's commitment to openness on 
the House floor and looked forward to a constructive Congress.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Roll Call, November 28, 1994.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, not only did the majority not reach Chairman 
Solomon's goal of 70 percent open rules, they employed what can 
only be described as a sleight of hand to define what is an 
open rule and what is restrictive rule in order to improve 
their statistics. According to the majority, 58.5 percent of 
the rules reported by the committee this session were 
categorized as open/modified open, 27.5 percent were 
structured/modified closed, and 14 percent were closed. We take 
some exception to these statistics because we believe that they 
do not honestly reflect the breakdown of special rules during 
the 104th Congress.
    In their views for the Survey of Activities for the 102nd 
Congress, the Republicans railed against the Democrats rules 
classification system. They pointed out that the Republican 
classification system used in the 102nd Congress (and the 
103rd): ``while identifying individual rules as open, closed or 
modified closed, lists the latter two as restrictive for the 
purposes of its comparative tables since the differences 
between modified open and modified closed are often in the eye 
of the beholder and closed rules are simply the most extreme 
form of a restrictive rule.'' \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Survey of Activities of the House Committee on Rules, 102nd 
Congress.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In those same views the Republicans criticized rules which 
set an overall time limit on the amendment process: ``The 
majority attempts to paint these as nearly open rules as well 
since as they observe of the 102nd Congress, under such rules 
`there were no instances in which the amendment process took 
the entire time allotted.' Nevertheless, we are concerned that 
such time caps may well cut-off Members who otherwise would 
like to offer amendments, especially since the managers of the 
bills can cleverly see to it that most time is consumed on 
committee amendments.'' \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Survey of Activities of the House Committee on Rules, 102nd 
Congress.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    They also classified rules which require amendments to be 
printed in the Congressional Record as restrictive. ``The 
minority classifies such rules as modified open, though they 
are still restrictive. Members who have not had time to look at 
a bill and draft amendments prior to its being called up are 
still shut out of the process.'' \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, with their ascension to majority status, the 
Republicans came to the conclusion that their definition of 
what is open and restrictive was no longer needed. They now 
categorize special rules as follows. An open/modified open rule 
is defined as: ``one under which any Member may offer a germane 
amendment under the five minute rule. A modified open rule is 
one under which any Member may offer a germane amendment under 
the five minute rule subject only to an overall time limit on 
the amendment process and/or a requirement that the amendment 
be pre-printed in the Congressional Record.'' \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ The Amendment Process Under Special Rules Reported by the Rules 
Committee 103rd Congress V. 104th Congress (as of September 30, 1996).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The term restrictive has completely disappeared from their 
lexicon and in its place the term structured/modified closed 
appears. This type of rule is defined as: ``one under which the 
Rules Committee limits the amendments that may be offered only 
to those amendments designated in the special rule or the Rules 
Committee report to accompany it, or which preclude amendments 
to a particular portion of a bill, even though the rest of the 
bill may be completely open to amendments.''
    Why would the Republicans make such a change? We believe 
the answer to that can be found in the tables accompanying 
these views. This analysis clearly shows that if the 
Republicans had held themselves to the same rigid standards 
that they held us to when we were in the majority, that their 
numbers would be almost the exact opposite of what they purport 
them to be, 56 percent restrictive, 44 percent open. 
Essentially the Republicans decided to change the rules of the 
game in order to make their manipulation of the rules process 
look more open than that of the democrats. We find this 
disturbing and hypocritical considering the past statements 
made by Republicans on the floor of the House and in past 
Survey of Activities.
    In this edition of the Survey of Activities the Republicans 
comment on the submission of charts which categorize rules in 
the Congressional Record during the course of this Congress. 
They correctly point out that we did not confine our charts 
solely to resolutions reported from the Rules Committee. In 
fact our chart was titled ``Floor Procedure in the 104th 
Congress'' and was intended to illustrate the Republicans' use 
of parliamentary procedure to restrict the Democrats 
opportunity to amend legislation.
    They took particular exception to the inclusion of several 
resolutions which provide for the disposition of Senate 
amendments. These resolutions are especially important because 
they provide for the consideration of Senate bills in the House 
and deny the minority its right to the motion to recommit. 
Frankly, we were shocked that the Republicans would take 
exception to their inclusion in our charts since they 
championed the protection of this right for so many years when 
they were in the minority. We would like to point out that for 
the purposes of this document, which is dedicated solely to 
activities of the Rules Committee, we have eliminated the six 
resolutions which were not reported from the committee.
    No matter how the total is calculated, the statistics 
reveal that the Republicans fell well short of Chairman 
Solomon's stated goal of reporting open rules on 70 percent of 
bills during the 104th Congress.
    The following is a chart which documents the resolutions 
reported from the Rules Committee during the 104th Congress. 
This chart is different from the one which was submitted for 
the Congressional Record during the session and which the 
Republicans took strong exception to. The information contained 
in that chart covered all floor procedure during the session 
and included closed rules adopted by the House such as the 
resolution providing for the consideration of H.R. 1 which was 
not reported from the Committee. While we did take such 
resolutions out of this chart we did not exclude three 
resolutions which make in order House amendments to Senate 
amendments to House passed bills. The reason for this is 
because these rules clearly provide for the initial 
consideration of continuing resolutions and also restrict the 
minority's traditional right to the motion to recommit. For 
further discussion of this point please read the section titled 
Motion to Recommit.

******* Restrictive rules are those which limit the number of amendments which can be offered, and include so called modified open and modified closed  
  rules as well as completely closed rules and rules providing for consideration in the House as opposed to the Committee of the Whole. This definition 
  of restrictive rule is taken from the Republican chart of resolutions reported from the Rules Committee in the 103rd Congress. N/A means not

                           motion to recommit

    While in the minority, Republicans staunchly defended the 
right to offer a motion to recommit, and promised to expand 
that right when they took over the House. On the first day of 
the 104th Congress, they did what they said; they amended 
clause 4(b) of rule XI to reaffirm the minority's long-standing 
right to offer a motion to recommit and added protection for a 
motion to recommit with instructions, at least if it is offered 
by the minority leader or a designee.
    But once again, they did not live up to their promises. In 
fact, they found innovative ways to undercut their commitments 
both to the motion to recommit with instructions and even the 
long-protected simple motion to recommit.
    There were questions raised about some of the first rules 
reported from the Committee which did not explicitly provide 
for a motion to recommit with instructions. These might have 
inadvertently violated the amended rule XI. For example, the 
rule providing for consideration of the Taos Pueblo Indians 
Land Transfer bill did not originally provide for a motion to 
recommit with instructions. The rule did provide for 
consideration of a committee amendment in the nature of a 
substitute. Under the rules and precedents of the House, a 
Member cannot offer an amendment to text already amended. 
Adoption of the committee substitute would amend the entire 
text and thereby preclude a motion to recommit with 
instructions unless explicitly sanctioned by the rule. A point 
of order was not pressed when the majority agreed to amend the 
rule on the floor to explicitly permit the motion to recommit 
with instructions.
    The most dangerous precedents were set by a series of rules 
reported at the beginning of the second session--in the midst 
of the fiscal crisis created by the Republican shut-down of the 
federal government.
    Exactly one year and a day after adopting the expanded 
protection, the Republican majority found a way to break its 
commitment to protect even the simple motion to recommit. On 
January 5, 1996, the Republican leadership used a transparent 
parliamentary ploy--not once, not twice, but three times--to 
circumvent the rule assuring the minority a motion to recommit. 
Clause 4(b) of rule XI, first adopted in 1909, prohibits the 
Rules Committee from reporting a resolution that prevents the 
minority from offering a motion to recommit. Specifically, 
clause 4(b) prohibits the Rules Committee from reporting a rule 
that ``would prevent the motion to recommit from being made as 
provided in clause 4 of rule XVI'' and clause 4 of rule XVI 
states that the motion will be in order ``after the previous 
question shall have been ordered on the passage of a bill or 
joint resolution.''
    The clear purpose of protecting the motion to recommit on 
passage of ``bills and joint resolutions'' is to guarantee that 
when the House first takes up a legislative proposal, the 
minority has a right to offer its point of view as the last 
matter decided before voting on passage.
    On January 5, the Republican majority in the House approved 
three extraordinarily restrictive rules providing for initial 
consideration of three new approaches to continuing 
appropriations. Instead of introducing a new bill or joint 
resolution to provide continuing appropriations--as would 
ordinarily be the case--the House took up a new House amendment 
to a Senate amendment to an unrelated House bill. For example, 
one rule hijacked a germane Senate amendment to a House bill 
dealing with the National Marine Fisheries Service lab in order 
to attach a continuing appropriations measure.
    The obvious and intended effect in all three cases was to 
circumvent the prohibition against the Committee on Rules 
reporting a rule that prevents a motion to recommit on initial 
consideration.
    There were other problems created by this scheme to avoid 
the motion to recommit: (1) in one case, the effort allowed the 
Senate to initiate appropriations against all the traditions of 
the House, and (2) in the remaining two examples, the rule was 
self-executing, denying Members the opportunity to voice their 
concern over the procedure without voting against undoing the 
Republican shut-down.
    The first rule, House Resolution 334, provided for 
consideration in the House of an unusual continuing 
appropriation amendment to a Senate clean and simple CR. The 
Senate CR was a nongermane amendment to an unrelated bill, H.R. 
1643, extending most-favored-nation duty status for products 
from Bulgaria. Before this Congress, the House would have 
simply ignored the Senate amendment to H.R. 1643. The House had 
previously guarded its traditional and precious prerogative to 
initiate appropriations, by blueslipping Senate appropriation 
measures and not taking up Senate amendments to House bills 
where such amendments initiate appropriations. By taking up 
H.R. 1643 with the Senate amendment, the House signaled its 
acceptance of the Senate infringement on the custom and 
privilege of the House to initiate spending. This price did not 
seem too high for the Republican leadership so long as it 
bought a way to prevent Democrats from offering an amendment or 
a simple motion to recommit.
    The next two rules, House Resolutions 336 and 338, went a 
step further. Not satisfied with blocking all amendments and 
the motion to recommit, the Republican majority denied any 
separate debate on the House amendment. Adoption of the rule 
constituted adoption of the House amendment. When the House 
passed the rule, the underlying bill and amendments were 
automatically sent to the Senate without further debate or 
vote.
    In effect, this precludes any serious discussion of the 
process. The seriousness of the issues involved--the threat of 
another costly government shutdown if the continuing 
appropriation was not passed--overwhelmed any debate about the 
motion to recommit. If any fair-minded Republicans had wanted 
to protest this rule (and its repudiation of the Republican 
commitment to a motion to recommit) they could not protest 
without fear of contradicting the Speaker's new policy on 
continuing government functions.
    On the question at hand, the motion to recommit, a self-
executing rule is not in order on initial consideration; it 
would violate the old and new rule protecting the motion to 
recommit. What permitted the self-executing rule was again the 
technique of hijacking an unrelated House bill with a Senate 
amendment to bring up a new legislative proposal, instead of 
introducing a new bill or joint resolution. The self-executing 
rule enabled the Republican leaders to deny the motion to 
recommit and to stifle any protest as well.
    Finally, the Republican leaders discovered one other 
inventive way to block consideration of a motion to recommit 
with instructions. The very first use of the new unfunded 
mandates point of order was to block consideration of a motion 
to recommit with instructions concerning minimum wage. In order 
to avoid a direct vote on the motion to recommit, the majority 
hid behind the question of consideration. For further 
explanation see the next section ``Unfunded Mandates unwaivable 
`Point of Order'.''
    In all, the Republicans found several creative ways to deny 
both the simple motion to recommit and the motion to recommit 
with instructions. There are costs, grave costs, attached to 
their abandoning this promise.

            unfunded mandates unwaivable ``point of order''

    The Republicans pledged to stop unfunded mandates on state 
and local governments by imposing new restrictions on the 
ability of Congress to impose such economic burdens. Instead 
they instituted a flawed system that has proven to be a 
partisan tool to stop legislative items that the Republican 
leadership does not want to move forward. Public Law 104-4 
implemented the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, the first 
major piece of legislation signed into law during the 104th 
Congress. This measure, which enjoyed wide bipartisan support, 
was intended to prevent the imposition of unfunded mandates on 
public and private sector entities. However, this well-
intentioned bill contained a major flaw--a new, non-waivable 
point of order. The legislation (in Section 425) specifically 
prevents the Rules Committee from waiving the point of order 
that may be triggered when there is (or is believed to be) an 
unfunded mandate in any bill, joint resolution, motion, 
conference report, or amendment. Only a small handful of House 
Rules in the history of the House of Representatives have ever 
been given this extraordinary protection. If a member raises an 
unfunded mandates point of order, all he or she need do is cite 
the provision in the measure under debate that is alleged to 
impose a mandate as defined in Section 425 of PL 104-4. There 
is an automatic 20 minutes of debate followed by a vote. There 
is no parliamentary or budgetary ruling on the validity of the 
point of order and there is no burden of proof on the member 
raising the point of order. It does not matter if the point of 
order is baseless. Simply raising the point of order requires 
the House to vote on whether to consider the text that is 
challenged. A simple majority of the House, for any reason, 
regardless of whether there is any legitimate financial 
imposition or not, can deny the opportunity for the House to 
proceed with an otherwise germane and viable legislative 
measure.
    During consideration of the unfunded mandates legislation 
we on the minority side of the Rules panel expressed concern 
over this provision of the bill noting that it could be used 
both to stop legislation not containing unfunded mandates from 
being considered on the Floor and as a dilatory tactic to 
disrupt the legislative process. We were always assured that 
this would not be used for this purpose. However, on the first 
formal raising of the point of order, it was used as a partisan 
tool to prevent the consideration of a legitimate legislative 
measure, a measure which did not even contain an unfunded 
mandate (a letter from the Congressional Budget Office 
confirmed this fact). Moreover, to add insult to injury, this 
tactic was used to prevent the minority from offering a germane 
motion to recommit with instructions, something that 
Republicans in previous Congresses had considered to be so 
sacred that one of their first changes in the House Rules in 
the 104th Congress was to guarantee the right of the minority 
to offer this motion. The motion (to H.R. 3136) would have 
required the implementation of an increase in the minimum wage 
before provisions in the underlying bill would be enacted. It 
did not directly implement the increase but rather called for 
subsequent legislative action to accomplish that goal. However, 
in this instance because the contents of the motion to recommit 
were controversial and opposed by the majority leadership at 
that time, the unfunded mandate point of order was used 
improperly to prevent any consideration of the issue contained 
in the motion. The vote on this non-unfunded mandate was nearly 
party line vote of 192 to 228.
    Ironically, the second formal use of the unfunded mandate 
point of order was used on the same subject matter, only this 
time the provision against which the point of order was raised 
actually implemented the minimum wage increase and therefore 
contained a legitimate unfunded mandate (again, confirmed in a 
letter by the Congressional Budget Office). But, by that time, 
due to an enormous public outcry, the Republican leadership 
wanted the measure to be considered and voted upon by the full 
House of Representatives. The vote (on H.R. 1227) to allow the 
consideration of the unfunded mandate notwithstanding the point 
of order was 267 to 161. Thus, a measure that did not contain 
an unfunded mandate was blocked from consideration and one 
which did have a substantial unfunded mandate was allowed to 
proceed.
    Because of the way this point of order was crafted, unless 
it is changed, there is no way to prevent future abuses. We are 
terribly concerned that if this practice continues, it will 
simply become a back-door approach to halt any discussion or 
vote on an otherwise appropriate and in-order measure, 
particularly in the case of the motion to recommit. We believe 
that the Rules Committee majority must move to stop this 
egregious misuse of this otherwise viable point of order and 
hope that they will convey to the Republican leadership that 
this use of the unfunded mandates legislation is not a 
legitimate method to squelch debate and Floor action on 
responsible legislative initiatives, regardless of the level of 
controversy they may generate. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
was intended to draw attention to financial burdens imposed on 
state and local governments and the private sector. It should 
not be used as a weapon to prevent the consideration of viable 
and responsible legislative initiatives and certainly not to 
prevent the minority from its right to offer a motion to 
recommit with instructions. The majority must carefully 
consider the ramifications of misusing the unfunded mandates 
point of order for purposes other than the legislative 
intentions spelled out in PL 104-4.

                   blanket waivers of points of order

    The Republicans promised not to grant blanket waivers of 
House rules during the 104th Congress. This is one of those 
promises they made to convince the American people that they 
would run the House differently. Like many other promises they 
made, this one was broken. In fact, they broke it over 100 
times. They reported more than 100 rules which gave blanket 
waivers to 90 bills and to hundreds of amendments and motions. 
The number of blanket waivers granted saw little change during 
this Congress.
    During the 104th Congress, H.Res. 6 contained an amendment 
to clause 4 of rule XI as follows: ``Whenever the Rules 
Committee reports a resolution providing for the consideration 
of a measure, it shall, to the maximum extent possible, specify 
in the resolution the object of any waiver of a point of order 
against the measure or against its consideration.'' According 
to the section-by-section summary of H.Res. 6 placed in the 
Congressional Record of January 4, 1995, the stated intent of 
this amendment was ``that Members be fully informed as to what 
potential violations of House rules are involved in considering 
a bill.'' The Record goes on to state that ``. . . it is 
expected that the Rules Committee will, in all but the most 
time-sensitive situations, endeavor to determine what specific 
waivers are required and detail them in the rule.''
    At first blush, this new provision would seem to be a 
highly commendable endeavor. It is clear that the membership of 
the House would be better served and informed as to the content 
of each measure before the House, if all waivers were specified 
in the resolution. That, however, has not been the case. The 
rule change has had little effect on the number of resolutions 
containing waivers of all points of order because it contains a 
large loophole. The rule says that the Rules Committee must 
meet this requirement only ``to the maximum extent possible.'' 
This loophole is the reason the Rules Committee could report 90 
resolutions containing waivers of all points of order against 
bills, resolutions, and conference reports. That total compares 
to 97 such resolutions reported during the 103rd, which is only 
7 less than before the rule was added.
    Secondly, the timing of the implementation of this rule 
seems to suggest that there has been some major abuse in 
granting non-specific waivers during past Congresses. As the 
rule implies, it is not always easy nor timely to identify each 
and every technical violation of the House rules for each 
measure before the House. We believe that this rule change was 
merely used to give the impression that significant change was 
being implemented because it places no requirement on the Rules 
Committee. Anytime the Republicans of the Rules Committee 
decided that they did not want the Members of the House to know 
what House rules were being broken, they simply slipped through 
the loophole and ignored the intent of the new rule. Needless 
to say, those ``time-sensitive situations'' referred to on the 
first day of the Congress were rather abundant during the 104th 
Congress. As stated previously, the 104th Congress has seen 
little change in the number of resolutions that gave blanket 
waivers. The change proposed in clause 4(e) of rule XI, even 
though it looks nice on the outside, is really just a hollow 
shell.

                  unprecedented use of ``martial law''

    The Minority has grave concern about the extent to which 
the Republican majority of the Rules Committee abused the use 
of the martial-law procedure during the 104th Congress. The 
abuse was so great that the House was forced to conduct 
business under this extraordinary procedure for an 
unprecedented 132 days. This included the longest continuous 
period of martial-law in history--121 days. Martial law refers 
to the waiving of clause 4(b) of rule XI (requiring a two-
thirds affirmative vote for same-day consideration by the House 
of a resolution reported from the Rules Committee) and to the 
granting of authority to the Speaker to entertain motions to 
suspend the rules. Under martial-law, the Republican leadership 
brought bills to the House floor with absolutely no prior 
notice to the Members. Martial-law was used to take away the 
normal protections afforded the Minority party and did not give 
Members adequate time to look over bills before they had to 
vote on them. When this procedure was used, the Republican 
leadership was simply telling Members to trust them and vote 
for the bills in front of them. They used the martial-law 
procedure to hide their special-interest backroom deals.
    During the 104th Congress, a major part of the federal 
government was shut down for a total of twenty-one days as the 
Republican leadership played ``chicken'' with the national 
economy. The martial-law procedure played a key role in this 
misguided strategy. The Republican leadership used the 
procedure to give themselves cover by saying that they were 
ready to move bills as soon as the President would agree to 
their demands. The American people did not buy into this and 
blamed the Republican Congress for the shut down.
    It was bad enough that the Republicans ran the House by 
martial-law for over four months. However, the manner in which 
they used it made matters even worse. Seven of the nine 
martial-law resolutions adopted in the House applied to whole 
classes of bills, allowing the leadership to call up any number 
of general appropriations bills, budget reconciliation bills, 
or debt ceiling bills at a moment's notice. As a result, the 
most egregious elements of the Republican agenda were rammed 
through the House with much fanfare but little debate.
    In contrast, the Democratic controlled House of the 103rd 
Congress conducted business under martial-law for a total of 
only five days. Of the five martial-law resolutions adopted by 
the House, each was effective for a period of only one day and 
each applied to one specific bill or conference report. There 
was not one instance when the procedure was used for a class of 
bills or for more than one day. This gave the membership the 
traditional one day's notice before the rule was called up on 
the House floor.
    It is highly ironic that during the floor debates regarding 
martial-law, that the Republicans were saying that they were 
only conducting business as usual. They had promised to change 
the way business was done in the House. This is one of the only 
promises they managed to keep. In fact, they took the House 
back to the good old days. Not since the days of Speaker Cannon 
has there been a more abusive use of the rules of the House 
than has occurred during this Congress.

                   three-fifths vote on tax increases

    Republicans promised--they adopted a new rule, clause 5(c) 
of rule XXI--to require a \3/5\ vote on any measure carrying a 
federal income tax rate increase. They waived the vote 
requirement every time it applied to a Republican measure:
          H.R. 1215 (H. Res. 128)--Contract With America Tax 
        Relief Act \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ In this instance, the rule did not explicitly waive the \3/5\ 
vote requirement. However, when the Chair was asked, in a parliamentary 
inquiry, whether the \3/5\ requirement applied the Chair stated that 
the requirement did not apply and the ruling of the Chair was appealed 
[April 5, 1995, Congressional Record, H4316-4319]. The ensuing exchange 
of letters is printed in November 9, 1995, Congress Record H11994-
H11999].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
          H.R. 2425 (H. Res. 238)--Medicare Preservation Act of 
        1994
          H.R. 2491 (H. Res. 245)--Budget Reconciliation Act of 
        1995
          H.R. 3103 (H. Res. 392)--Health Insurance Reform
          H.R. 1227 (H. Res. 440)--Small Business Job 
        Protection Act of 1996
          H.R. 3734 (H. Res. 495)--Welfare Reform Conference 
        Report
    All these measures raised taxes. H.R. 1215 would make those 
who invest venture capital in qualified jobs-creating small 
businesses pay a higher rate of federal income tax than they 
would under existing law. H.R. 2425 would increase tax rates on 
those who make unqualified withdrawals from medical savings 
accounts and would impose a new tax rate on high-income 
Medicare beneficiaries. H.R. 2491 would have raised taxes on 
millions of American working families by modifying the earned 
income tax credit and contained several other tax rate 
increases. H.R. 3103 contained some of the same tax rate 
increases as in H.R. 2425. H.R. 1227 increased tax rates on 
nonqualified withdrawals from simplified pension plans. They 
voted for tax hikes on working families by majority vote and, 
to do so, they waived the new rule without a second thought.
    Republicans clearly backtracked on their promise to use 
this new rule to restrict tax increases. Remember, their 
original promise was to require a \3/5\ vote on any tax 
increase, not just income taxes and not just income tax rate 
increases.
    On opening day Speaker Gingrich said, ``Those of us who 
ended up in the majority stood on those steps and signed a 
contract and here is what it says: `The new Republican majority 
will . . . require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax 
increase.''' (Congressional Record, January 4, 1995, page H6). 
Notice the Speaker said any tax increase, not just a tax rate 
increase.
    The original idea may have been to make it more difficult 
to raise taxes but a quiet revolution within the Republican 
conference narrowed the scope of the rules change so that the 
new rule only covered tax rate increases.
    In other words, Republicans may have promised not to raise 
income tax rates without a \3/5\ vote; however, under the new 
rule they can raise payroll taxes, excise taxes, other income 
taxes including the effective rates of income taxes. Under the 
new rule, they can raise every kind of tax, short of statutory 
rate increases, with impunity.
    But even this narrow restriction now proves too difficult 
for Republicans to live with. It took no longer than the first 
100 days and the Contract With America tax bill to force them 
to bypass their own new rule. The Chair was compelled to rule 
on the application of the new rule and the embarrassment caused 
by that ruling is documented in an exchange of letters printed 
in the Congressional Record of November 9, 1995 [H11994-
H11999].
    In fact, the problems caused by that ruling led the 
majority to adopt rules for consideration of subsequent tax 
rate increases that explicitly waived the \3/5\ voting 
requirement on each of the bills and any subsequent conference 
reports.
    It was recently reported (Roll Call, Monday, November 25, 
1996, page 15) that the Republican conference voted to further 
narrow the application of this rule to very specific rates that 
cannot be increased.
    We want to make clear there is nothing in the legislative 
history to support a further narrowing of the rule. The 
legislative history in fact supports the broadest possible 
interpretation of the rule since every supporter speaks broadly 
about the rule touching all tax increases. Here's how 
Republicans described their rule change at the time it was 
adopted:
    Rep. Dick Armey--``House rules will now require a three-
fifths majority to raise taxes''--Cong Rec H31, Wednesday, 
January 4.
    Rep. John Boehner--``. . . and we decided to change the 
rules to require a three-fifths majority to raise taxes''--Cong 
Rec H127, Thursday, January 5.
    Rep. Gerry Solomon--``Mr. Speaker, the tax-and-spend 
Democrats are at it again. They are suing us Republicans, do 
you believe it, to overturn our rules change that requires a 
three-fifths majority vote to raise taxes.
    ``The three-fifths majority vote to raise taxes will stand 
as a hindrance to any Democrat attempt to foist more taxes on 
the American people. There ain't going to be any more''--Cong 
Rec H1469, Thursday, February 9.
    Rep. Joe Barton of Texas--``This country was founded on the 
principle of no taxation without representation. Today many 
Americans believe that principle has been violated and that 
their elected Representatives in Washington have taxed them so 
that they can spend money on the special big-spending interests 
in Washington, DC. To correct this said situation the new 
Republican majority has now introduced section 106 of the rule 
change package. Section 106 would require a three-fifths vote 
to increase income taxes''--Cong Rec H70, Wednesday, January 4.
    Rep. Gary Franks--``Under this [rules] package, any income 
tax increase must now be approved by a three-fifths majority of 
the House of Representatives''--Cong Rec H43, Wednesday, 
January 4.
    Rep. Jon Fox--``The goal of this rule is twofold. First, it 
will require three-fifths majority vote for tax increase 
measures and amendments''--Cong Rec H63, Wednesday, January 4.
    Rep. Jim Saxton--``As you know, this amendment to the House 
rules provides for a three-fifths or 60 percent vote as a 
necessity to pass any income tax increase''--Cong Rec H63, 
Wednesday, January 4.
    Rep. Randy Tate--``I am in favor of the proposal of 
requiring a 60-percent majority in order to raise taxes so that 
the taxing ways of Congress are gone forever''--Cong Rec H68, 
Wednesday, January 4.
    Rep. Joe Scarborough--``We have to have a three-fifths 
supermajority now to pass any tax increases on middle class 
citizens across this country''--Cong Rec H1898, Thursday, 
February 16.
    Rep. Joe Scarborough--``When you pass a taxpayer protection 
plan that we passed the first day of Congress, that requires 
this body to pass new taxes increase by a three-fifths vote in 
the 104th Congress, you are saving jobs . . .''--Cong Rec 
H2031, Wednesday, February 22.
    Rep. Gil Gutknecht--``And we also required a three-fifths 
vote to pass any kind of tax increase''--Cong Rec H6824, 
Tuesday, July 11.
    Every single Member speaks broadly of all income tax 
increases. No one even mentions rates, let alone a more limited 
reading. It is only after they were caught with their hands in 
the cookie jar (and they waived the vote requirement every time 
it touched their bills) that they wanted to narrow the rule.
    The problem, we submit, is not the breadth of the rule. The 
problem is that no one can accomplish their political ends by 
means of a new House rule setting a supermajority vote 
requirement. Such rules invariably must face the fact that the 
House is a majoritarian institution; if the Republican majority 
wishes to increase taxes, even a specific income tax rate, no 
rule will or should stop them. It is a mistake to try to use 
the rules of the House to bypass majority rule on fiscal and 
political policy decisions.

  limiting the ability of committees to sit while the house is meeting

    The Republicans promised to make sweeping changes in the 
House Rules, changes that would dramatically improve the inner 
workings of the House. In their opening day Rules package 
contained in H.Res. 6, the Republicans reinstated in clause 
2(i)(l) of Rule XI that committees (with certain exceptions 
including but not limited to the Rules, Budget and 
Appropriations Committees) may not meet without special request 
while the House is reading a measure for amendment under the 
five-minute rule. However, we are not certain why this change 
was necessary because there was no discussion or justification 
of the need for this measure in any of the January 4, 1995 
Floor debate. We can only conclude that this provision was 
intended to greatly improve and increase the involvement of 
members on legislation under consideration on the House Floor. 
But, as has been the case with several other rule changes in 
the 104th Congress, this measure was an example of a solution 
looking for a problem.
    This provision was deleted from the rules of the 103rd 
Congress because it had proven to be a deterrent to the House 
in the timely completion of its committee business. There 
simply were not enough hours when the House was not in session 
for committees to meet and carry out the demands of their heavy 
schedules. While in theory it might be desirable to have all 
members on the Floor during every moment of consideration of a 
bill for amendment under the five-minute rule, it is highly 
impractical and would certainly severely limit the legislative 
schedule of the House. Committees have very full dockets and a 
limited amount of time in which to consider and report critical 
legislative initiatives to the full House for consideration. 
This proved to be the case in the 104th Congress. On virtually 
every substantial legislative day of both sessions of this 
Congress, majority members have come to the Floor to ask for 
unanimous consent or to entertain a motion to allow committees 
to meet during the five-minute rule.
    During the 104th Congress there were more than 114 
requests, either through a privileged motion by the Majority 
Leader or through a unanimous consent request, for waivers for 
committees to meet. These requests covered a total of 964 
committee meetings. The accompanying chart, prepared by the 
Congressional Research Service, shows the many instances when 
the majority sought to waive this rule. Given these enormous 
numbers, it is clear that the majority should include a repeal 
of this provision in their opening day rules package.

            limits on committee and subcommittee assignments

    With great fanfare on the opening day of the 104th 
Congress, the Republican majority trumpeted their new rules on 
committees. Members were limited to no more than 2 full 
committees and no more than 4 subcommittees. Assignment limits 
are one of the linchpins of committee reform: by limiting 
members to fewer committees, there would be fewer schedule 
clashes making the ban on proxy voting more tenable and 
possibly might allow more committees to complete their work 
without meeting when the Committee of the Whole is debating 
amendments.
    The problem is that this new rule, as with so many others, 
was simply waived or ignored when it proved inconvenient. A 
quick glance through the Clerk's Official List of Committee 
Assignments, dated September 3, 1996, reveals 41 Republican 
members each assigned to more than 2 committees; 30 Republican 
members of the House violate the 4-subcommittee rule, some even 
serving on 6 subcommittees. Two-thirds of the members violating 
the subcommittee rule are freshmen Republicans.

                               conclusion

    To be sure the 104th Congress had many accomplishments that 
are worthy of praise from both sides of the aisle. According to 
the majority, new rules were adopted and adhered to and a more 
open, deliberative process governed the day-to-day running of 
the House during the course of the 104th Congress. As the 
minority, however, we feel it was our responsibility to set the 
record straight.
    The facts show that the performance of the Republican 
majority fell far short of their rhetoric. New rules were 
routinely waived and the amendment process was far more closed 
than promised. Having been in the majority prior to this 
Congress we bring a unique perspective to this process. We 
understand the difficulties and pitfalls that face the 
governing party as they move their agenda through Congress. It 
is by no means an easy task.
    The fact remains that the Republican majority made 
significant promises at the beginning of this Congress that 
they could not fulfill.

                                Appendix

                        a case study: time caps

    The fact that for so long Democrats and Republicans have 
been unable to agree on the number of rules that are open or 
restrictive indicates that more fundamental questions about the 
terms of the debate are unresolved.
    For example, we agreed in the 103rd Congress and we agree 
in the 104th Congress on how many rules impose time caps. The 
question is: are time cap rules restrictive or open?
    For purposes of assessing whether Republicans lived up to 
their promise of 70 percent open rules, it seems proper to 
categorize time cap rules as restrictive because when they made 
their commitment, the term ``open'' meant open. It did not mean 
some brand new amalgam of open rules and those rules 
Republicans used to call ``restrictive'' and now call 
``modified open.'' It seems only proper to assess their 
performance on their own terms and for that reason to place 
time cap rules in the same category they did: restrictive.
    But Republicans now claim that time cap rules are modified 
open rules and should count toward their commitment to 
openness.
    Are time cap rules really open? We said, in the survey of 
activities of the 103rd Congress, that time cap rules are not 
strictly speaking open. Yet it does not follow that they are 
restrictive. Our point then and now is that you cannot simply 
read the rule to determine whether a time cap restricts the 
offering of germane amendments; you need to look at each 
particular time cap and how it affected consideration of the 
measure made in order. A time cap placed on consideration of a 
measure which demands a great deal of debate on more than a 
handful of amendments will constrict. A time limit on a less 
controversial measure, even if it is a shorter time period, may 
not restrict the offering of any germane amendments.
    Let's look at the time cap rules adopted in the 103rd 
Congress and the time cap rules in the 104th. The facts will 
support the conclusion that time caps in this Congress were 
restrictive but time caps in the 103rd Congress were not--just 
the reverse of the Republican categorization scheme.
    Republican time caps were restrictive (1) because they used 
time for voting to count against the limited time alloted for 
amendments, (2) because under Republican time caps, amendments 
were offered almost exclusively by Members of the Committee and 
(3) because at the end of the day there were Members who were 
denied the opportunity to offer germane amendments but that was 
not so in the case of time cap rules in the 103rd Congress
    (1) Time caps in the 103rd specifically excluded voting 
time in 4 out of 5 cases but in all cases in the 104th Congress 
the restriction on the amount of time for debating amendments 
included time for voting.
    In the 103rd Congress, there were 5 bills considered under 
rules with time caps on the amendment process; four in 1994 and 
one in 1993. All four of the time caps from 1994 specifically 
excluded voting time. The single exception in the 103rd was 
H.R. 1036, ERISA Amendments Act. The Rules Committee asked for 
amendments in advance and received only 2 (Reps. Fawell and 
Berman). On the floor, Mr. Fawell offered his; it was defeated. 
Mr. Berman did not offer. No other amendments were offered and 
the total time consumed by the amendment process (including 
votes) was about one hour and 15 minutes.
    The record of the 104th Congress is quite different. At 
least two hours of the limited time was eaten up by voting on 
each of the measures considered under timecap rules in the 
104th Congress. In one case, more than forty percent of the 
capped time was devoted to voting. The chart below illustrates 
with some examples from the time cap rules adopted in the 104th 
Congress:
    The following is a list of several examples of rules which 
included time caps and the amount of time spent voting under 
this process.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Many members, Republican and Democratic, rose to 
complain that the time cap rules in the 104th Congress denied 
members who are not on the committee of jurisdiction the 
opportunity to offer amendments. The normal order of 
recognition permits members from the committee to be recognized 
before members not on the committee. Even with priority of 
recognition given to those with pre-printed amendments, the 
fact is that there were many more amendments printed in advance 
than there was time under the cap to consider (See the next 
section). So the competition for limited time gave advantage to 
pre-printed amendments offered by members of the committee at 
the expense of amendments--whether or not pre-printed--offered 
by members not on the committee.
    (3) Even more importantly, the test of whether a time cap 
is restrictive is whether Members are excluded from offering 
germane amendments. The bottom line is: were there any Members 
with germane amendments to offer when the time expired?
    In the 103rd Congress, no bills considered under a time cap 
consumed the entire amount of time.

    No one in the 103rd Congress was shut out by a time cap. No 
Member with a germane amendment to a bill considered under a 
time cap was denied the opportunity to offer because time had 
expired.
    Before the Committee rose, on each of the time-cap rules in 
the 103rd Congress, the Chair asked, ``Are there any additional 
amendments?'' and then hearing no response, the Chair said, 
``If there are no further amendments, under the rule the 
Committee rises.''
    In the 104th, on each and ever time-cap rule, the Chair was 
forced to state that all time for consideration of amendments 
had expired. In each and every case, there were identifiable 
Members with pre-printed amendments who were shut out. Who 
knows how many others who did not print their amendments in 
advance were shut out? The chart below shows in the case of 
several time cap rules adopted in the 104th Congress the names 
of those members who had printed amendments in advance but had 
not offered their amendments when time under the cap ran out.

    This is a list of Members who were not allowed to offer 
amendments to major time cap legislation because the time cap 
on amendments had expired. These amendments were also pre-
printed in the Congressional Record. This list is not an an 
exhaustive one. It contains only Members who had pre-printed 
their amendments; others may have wished to offer amendments 
but were prevented from doing so because the time for amendment 
had expired.

                  special procedures--king of the hill

    The Republican majority came to a position of 
responsibility promising to conduct the business of the House 
in a manner which is accurate, accountable and fair. One 
special procedure adopted by the Republicans, however, may 
result in a determination of the House which does not 
accurately reflect the will of the Members. As with many 
legislative initiatives, this new Republican majority chose a 
label for their procedure which promises much and delivers 
less. ``Most votes wins'' replaces the ``King of the Hill'' 
amendment structure which has been utilized successfully over 
the past decade.
    The ``King of the Hill'' structure was first used in 1982 
to provide for the consideration of several competing 
substitutes for the 1983 Budget Resolution. The regular 
amendment process would have precluded and remaining 
alternatives from being considered once one alternative had 
been adopted. Since Members had no assurance they would be able 
to decide upon each policy choice independently, according to 
its own merit, the Committee devised the new procedure to 
guarantee that each amendment would be voted on regardless of 
the disposition of any of the alternatives. King of the Hill 
gave members maximum ability to examine a range of policies and 
to work its will on each major policy choice.
    The procedure came under fire from the then-Republican 
minority, who believed that it left open the possibility for an 
amendment to receive a large majority vote and still be 
defeated. In the 104th Congress, the Republicans adopted an 
alternative procedure which provides that the amendment with 
the most votes would win. ``Most vote wins'' implies a 
parliamentary competition in which all alternatives are 
considered simultaneously and the one which receives the most 
votes will prevail. This is not the case.
    Under regular order, the amendments are considered 
sequentially. Each amendment adopted becomes base text to be 
tested against the next amendment. For example, a special 
structure making in order three substitute amendments provides 
the House with four choices, including the text of the 
underlying bill. The first vote would test support for the 
first amendment against the text of the bill to determine which 
of the two alternatives Members prefer. If the first amendment 
is adopted, it replaces the bill as the preferred text to be 
tested against the merits of the second amendment. If the first 
amendment prevails again, it remains text to be tested against 
the third alternative amendment. If adopted again, it would 
pass as the language tested and preferred against all of the 
alternatives. It also would be the last amendment adopted.
    The process of consideration of amendments is the same for 
both the ``King of the Hill'' and the ``most votes wins'' 
procedure. Under either structure, each alternative faces the 
other alternatives one by one. It is misleading to declare, as 
the Republicans have, that the amendment receiving the most 
votes represents the amendment preferred by the Members among 
all the alternatives. Rather, each vote in the sequence 
measures the degree of difference between the two alternatives 
competing at the time. There may be a weak alternative which 
results in a lopsided vote in one of the match-ups. This does 
not mean, however, that the winner is the preferred alternative 
among the other choices. Another alternative may prove 
significantly more competitive. The ``most vote wins'' 
procedure provides that an amendment which receives the most 
votes at some point during the sequence will prevail. The 
``King of the Hill'' procedure stipulates that the amendment 
which wins each successive head-to-head test (the last 
amendment passed) will prevail as the text Members prefer to 
all alternatives.
    Finally, there is no assurance in the legislative process 
that the amendment with the most votes wins. An amendment can 
always be superseded by another amendment or by another 
substitute whether it is considered under regular order or 
under one of the special procedures. The final opportunity to 
amend a bill is guaranteed to the minority party in the motion 
to recommit. This vote can overturn an amendment agreed to 
earlier in the process regardless of the number of votes that 
amendment received.
    An examination of the rules considered in the past two 
Congresses illustrates that there was never an instance in 
which the amendment in the last-passed position received fewer 
votes. It also refutes the notion that placing an amendment 
anywhere in the sequence favors its passage. In the 103rd 
Congress, ``King of the Hill'' procedures were used in 15 
instances. In three instances, all amendments in the ``King of 
the Hill'' structure failed. In six instances, the amendment 
which prevailed was not in the last position. In four 
instances, the last position prevailed, but in none of those 
cases did any preceding amendments receive a greater number of 
votes. In two of these four instances, more than one amendment 
passed, but the last amendment also received the most votes.
    In the 104th Congress, the Republican majority substituted 
the ``most votes wins'' procedure in place of ``King of the 
Hill.'' The procedure was used in three instances. In one 
instance, none of the amendments passed. In one instance, the 
last amendment passed and all other amendments failed. In one 
instance, two amendments passed. The last amendment in order 
passed with the most votes, replacing an earlier committee 
substitute which passed with fewer votes. The committee 
substitute would have been supplanted under the King of the 
Hill procedure as well.
    Below is a statistical summary of the use of the ``King of 
the Hill'' and ``most votes wins'' procedures in the 103rd and 
104th Congresses.
