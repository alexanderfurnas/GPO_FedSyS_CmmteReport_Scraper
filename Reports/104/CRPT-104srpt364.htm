                         I. Summary of the Bill

   TITLE I--PROVISIONS RELATING to the NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

Director's discretionary fund (sec. 101)

    This provision reauthorizes the discretionary fund for the 
Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Children's vaccine initiative (sec. 102)

    This provision reauthorizes the children's vaccine 
initiative.

   TITLE II--PROVISIONS relating TO THE NATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTES

Research on osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and related bone disorders 
        (sec. 201)

    This provision reauthorizes research initiatives in 
osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and related bone diseases.

Establishment of National Human Genome Research Institute (sec. 202)

    This provision elevates the National Center for Human 
Genome Research to institute status by the establishment of the 
National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). This will 
ensure a continued focus of NIH resources on important genetic 
research. It continues the commitment of the NIH to ethical, 
legal, and social issues relative to genome research by 
maintaining a set-aside of at least 5 percent of NHGRI 
extramural research funds for research in these areas.

Increased amount of grants and other awards (sec. 203)

    This provision increases from $50,000 to $100,000 the 
amount that an institute can grant on the basis of technical 
and peer review alone. Grants greater than $100,000 will 
continue to require advisory council approval. This proposal 
would eliminate duplication of the approval process beyond that 
of peer review for small grants and would accelerate funding of 
new, cutting-edge proposals.Meetings of advisory committees and 
councils and application of Federal Advisory Committee Act (sec. 204)
    This provision allows the convening of advisory councils 
and committees on an as-needed basis, instead of three to four 
times a year as currently required by law. This change would 
permit the NIH to reduce the expense associated with bringing 
advisers and committee members to Bethesda, MD, several times a 
year. These groups already take advantage of telecommunications 
technology for timely discussion and decision making.
    The application of the provisions of the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act to peer review committees is eliminated, thus 
reducing this administrative burden. The provisions of this act 
continue to apply to all other advisory committees and councils 
of the NIH.

Elimination or modification of reports (sec. 205)

    The bill increases administrative efficiency by eliminating 
the requirement for reports that are duplicative or unduly 
burdensome. The reports that are eliminate or modified include: 
the biennial report of the Director, NIH, to Congress and the 
President; the annual report of the Arthritis and 
Musculoskeletal Diseases Interagency Coordinating Committee; 
the annual report of the Skin Diseases Interagency Coordinating 
Committee; the annual report of the National Arthritis and 
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Advisory Board; the 
Secretary's annual report to Congress on Health Services 
Research relating to alcohol abuse and alcoholism, drug abuse, 
and mental health; the Secretary's triennial report to Congress 
on drug abuse; two annual reports to Congress on Sudden Infant 
Death Syndrome Research; the reports of the Coordinating 
Committees of Digestive Diseases, Diabetes Mellitus, and 
Kidney, Urologic and Hematological Diseases; the report of the 
U.S.-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program; and the report 
of the Task Force on Aging Research. It also converts the 
schedule for the report on disease prevention from annual to 
biennial.

               title III--specific institutes and centers

National Cancer Institute (secs. 301-302)

    The bill authorizes $3 billion for fiscal year 1997 and 
such sums as necessary for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 for 
general funding for the National Cancer Institute.
    In addition, it specifically reauthorizes programs in 
breast cancer, other gynecologic cancers, prostate cancer, and 
the conditions associated with exposure to the drug 
diethylstilbestrol.

National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (sec. 311)

    The bill authorizes $1.6 billion for fiscal year 1997 and 
such sums as necessary for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (secs. 321-322)

    The bill reauthorizes the research initiative in 
tuberculosis and the Terry Beirn Community-Based AIDS Research 
Initiative.

National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (sec. 331)

    This provisions reauthorizes the Centers for Contraception 
and Infertility.

National Institute on Aging (sec. 341)

    The bill authorizes $550 million for fiscal year 1997 and 
such sums as necessary for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.

National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (secs. 351-352)

    The bill authorizes $330 million for fiscal year 1997 and 
such sums as necessary for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.
    Section 352 corrects an omission from earlier authorization 
language regarding the definition of ``construction'' for use 
with reference to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism.

National Institute on Drug Abuse (secs. 361-363)

    The bill authorizes $480 million for fiscal year 1997 and 
such sums as necessary for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.
    In addition, the medication development program is 
authorized. Section 363 corrects an omission from earlier 
authorization language regarding the definition of 
``construction'' for use with reference to the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse.

National Institute of Mental Health (sec. 371)

    The bill authorizes $750 million for fiscal year 1997 and 
such sums as necessary for fiscal years 1998 and 1999.

National Center for Research Resources (secs. 381-384)

    The bill reauthorizes support for construction and 
modernization of biomedical and behavior research facilities 
from approved grants. It requires a larger matching component 
from grantee institutions in that the amount provided by 
Federal funds is reduced from 50 percent to 40 percent for 
research facilities and from 40 percent to 30 percent for 
multipurpose facilities.
    To provide the infrastructure for clinical research and 
clinical research training, the bill authorizes support for the 
general clinical research centers located throughout the 
country.
    To address the need for expanded involvement in clinical 
research, the bill establishes clinical research career 
enhancement awards to support individual careers in clinical 
research. In addition, it establishes innovative medical 
science awards to support individual clinical research 
projects.

National Library of Medicine (secs. 391-392)

    The bill authorizes $160 million for fiscal year 1997 and 
such sums as necessary for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. It also 
increases the cap on individual extramural grants from the 
National Library of Medicine to $1.25 million.

                     title iv--awards and training

Medical Scientist Training Program (sec. 401)

    The Medical Scientist Training Program supports 
professional education for students who intend to pursue 
careers in academic medicine. This provision expands the fields 
in which students may study in this program. It does so by 
broadening the program to include the option of a doctoral 
degree in certain nonbiologic science disciplines, for example, 
biostatistics, epidemiology, economics, or bioethics.

General loan repayment (secs. 402-404)

    The bill raises the maximum level of qualified loan 
repayments from $20,000 to $35,000 for each year of service for 
appropriately qualified health professionals conducting 
research training as employees of the NIH. These changes relate 
to established programs with respect to AIDS, contraception and 
infertility, programs for research generally, and clinical 
research programs for individuals for disadvantage backgrounds. 
In addition, it establishes a general loan repayment program to 
be under the direction of the Director of NIH. The Director 
will annually designate the fields of research that will be 
included in this program.
    Section 404 would increase from 50 to 100 the total number 
of contracts for scholarships and loan repayments that the 
Secretary may provide through the Undergraduate Scholarship 
Program Regarding Professions Needed By National Research 
Institutes, and the Loan Repayment Program Regarding Clinical 
Researchers From Disadvantaged Backgrounds. Moreover, the sites 
where such training may take place are expanded beyond the NIH 
campus to include clinical research training positions at 
General Clinical Research Centers and other extramural sites. 
At least 50 percent of these awards will go to health 
professionals from disadvantaged backgrounds.

                 title v--research with respect to aids

Comprehensive plan for expenditure of AIDS appropriations (sec. 501)

    This provision reauthorizes the research program regarding 
AIDS and continues its administration through the Office of 
AIDS Research.

Emergency AIDS discretionary fund (sec. 502)

    The bill reauthorizes an emergency AIDS discretionary fund 
that is available to the Director of the Office of AIDS 
Research for projects of significant need.

                      title vi--general provisions

Authority of the Director of the NIH (sec. 601)

    The bill gives the Director of the NIH the authority to 
establish intramural training programs and gives the Director 
the authority to hire and compensate health care professionals 
at a level similar to the Department of Veteran Affairs.

Office of Rare Disease Research (sec. 611)

    The bill codifies the Office of Rare Diseases, which 
currently exists in the Office of the Director of the NIH. The 
purpose of this office is to promote and coordinate the conduct 
of research on rare diseases through a strategic plan and to 
establish and manage a rare disease research clinical database.

Certain reauthorizations (secs. 621-622)

    The bill reauthorizes the research training programs funded 
as the National Research Service Awards and the nonprofit 
corporation known as the National Foundation for Biomedical 
Research.

Miscellaneous provisions (secs. 631-636)

    Section 631 takes a first step toward establishing 
additional sources of funding for biomedical research at the 
NIH by creating a National Fund for Health Research in the U.S. 
Department of the Treasury. This trust fund would be on budget. 
A source of revenue for the fund is not provided.
    A definition of clinical research is provided for reference 
throughout the bill.
    The bill amends the Senior Biomedical Research Service 
retirement provisions to enable the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services to make contributions as a nonprofit entity to 
the academic retirement systems in which members participated 
immediately prior to their appointment in the Service.
    Section 634 authorizes a pediatric research initiative. It 
authorizes $50 million over fiscal years 1997 through 1999, to 
be available to the Director of the NIH to encourage increased 
support across a broad spectrum of pediatric research areas.
    Section 635 authorizes increased funding specifically for 
research focused on diabetes.
    The bill provides for an initiative for research in 
Parkinson's disease. It would establish up to 10 Morris K. 
Udall Research Centers for interdisciplinary study of the cause 
and treatment of Parkinson's disease. In addition, it would 
establish Morris K. Udall Awards for Innovation in Parkinson's 
Disease Research to support innovative proposals for research 
in this field.

Repeals and conforming amendments (sec. 641)

    This provision makes corrections in current law regarding 
references to the National Institute for Nursing Research and 
the Under Secretary for Health of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.
    In addition, it repeals a number of duplicative advisory 
boards and committees, including the National Diabetes Advisory 
Board, National Digestive Diseases Board, National Kidney and 
Urologic Diseases Advisory Board, National Arthritis and 
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Advisory Board, National 
Deafness and Other Communications Disorders Advisory Board, 
National Commission on Alcoholism and Other Alcohol Related 
Problems, and Advisory Council on Hazardous Substances Research 
and Training.

                II. Background and Need for Legislation

                                GENERAL

    Funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the 
waning 20th century cannot be considered separate from the 
broader issues of health care delivery in the United states. A 
recent report from the Institute of Medicine of the National 
Academy of Sciences noted, ``the escalating costs of health 
care and the large number of uninsured and underinsured people 
in the United States have thrown health care issues into the 
policy arena at all levels of government.''
    Policies that shape authorizing legislation for the NIH are 
influenced by two overarching issues. First is the ever-
expanding base of biomedical knowledge which creates new 
promises and countless creative research opportunities. 
Researchers in academic health centers (AHC's) around the 
country--researchers who depend on grants from the NIH for 
sustenance--generate four times as many approved proposals for 
support by the NIH than can be funded by the available budgeted 
dollars.
    Second, the academic medical community--where the bulk of 
basic biomedical research takes place--is posed with an 
unprecedented challenge: how will AHC's maintain their research 
mission in the context of the competitive health care 
marketplace in which they now exist. The clinical practice 
environment has traditionally provided an important arena for 
the research and education roles of AHC's. In addition, fees 
from faculty practice plans have provided cross-subsidies for 
the academic mission of many AHC's. The cost of research and 
education places AHC's at a disadvantage in the competition for 
managed care contracts. Consequently, the very task that 
distinguishes these academic health institutions places them at 
a market disadvantage among their nonacademic competitors and 
threatens their ability to continue their mission.

                   HISTORY OF THE NIH AND ITS FUNDING

    After a half century of research in Public Health Service 
laboratories, the NIH, as we know it today, had its birth in 
1930. It moved to its present site in Bethesda, MD in 1938. 
World War II gave biomedical research a substantial boost that 
led to extramural funding--funding that is in the form of 
grants to universities, hospitals, and other research 
institutions.
    Extramural research grants are funded based on a systematic 
process that requires approval by expert colleagues of the 
proposed research concept and plans before consideration for 
funding. This peer-review process is at the heart of the NIH 
research funding process. This has been enormously successful 
in evaluating the scientific and technical merit of proposals, 
which supports the awarding of the most meritorious projects. 
This process brings together acknowledged experts who review 
proposals for research funding in their respective scientific 
fields. Based on their own expertise, they make decisions on 
the abilities of investigators to be successful in their 
proposals, as well as on the creativity of their proposals. 
Subsequently, the advisory councils of the NIH Institutes and 
Centers review the approved proposals for program relevance and 
appropriateness of the scientific and technical review.
    After World War II, debates began in Congress underscoring 
the tension between research autonomy, on the one hand, and 
greater public control of research spending, on the other. This 
discussion continues to this day.
    The NIH moved forward from the post-war era with a growth 
rate that doubled research support every 5 years until 1990. 
However, inflation and the effort to balance the Federal budget 
have curbed this growth rate.
    Regarding inflation, Dr. Harold Varmus, the Director of the 
NIH, has acknowledged that Federal funding for biomedical 
research has entered an era of steady-state funding. The Bureau 
of Economic analysis in the U.S. Department of Commerce defines 
the price index for biomedical research as the Biomedical 
Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI). This index 
represents the expenditure weights that are constituted by 
unique costs of biomedical research--variables such as indirect 
costs of administration for research and other costs of high 
technology. Consistently, BRDPI has always been higher than 
general inflation. Therefore, to maintain steady-state funding, 
Federal funding for the NIH will have to be greater than 
general inflation.
    During the first session of the 104th congress, the NIH 
fared well. The continuing resolution that funded the NIH for 
fiscal year 1996 provided a 5.7 percent increase. It is 
unlikely that such a rate of growth can be sustained in the 
future given the budget pressures of other discretionary 
domestic spending, as well as the pressure created by ever-
increasing entitlement spending.

              POLICY ISSUES AND REAUTHORIZATION OF THE NIH

    Four broad issues have been central to the discussions 
leading up to reauthoriztion legislation for the NIH in the 
104th Congress: first, the conflict between earmarked research 
and investigator-initiated research funding; second, the 
perceived diminished role for clinical research compared to 
basic research funding; third, a need for administrative 
simplification and efficiency to free up scarce dollars for 
grant-making; and finally, concern about the educational 
preparation of future biomedical researchers.

1. Earmarks versus investigator-initiated research

    Earmarks for specific research programs have traditionally 
driven funding for new initiatives. A recent trend in research 
funding has been for preferential support for promising efforts 
arising from investigator-initiated research. This was the 
implication of testimony from several witnesses at hearings 
conducted by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources 
in March 1996. This argument found its voice in the markup of 
S. 1897, where members of the committee acknowledged the 
difficulty inherent in a process where Congress calls for more 
programs while the overall budget for the NIH has little 
growth. Such a predicament creates the tension of a request for 
new areas of investment by the authorizing committee but an 
inability to provide resources by the appropriators.

2. Basic versus clinical research

    Basic research is the pursuit of fundamental biomedical 
mechanisms, proceeding from one discovery to the next, driven 
by the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. Clinical research 
describes the fields of research that are patient-focused. 
Clinical research applies basic research to patient care. Over 
time, the line between basic research and clinical research 
migrates toward basic research. As the molecular understanding 
of biomedical processes expands, the research opportunities in 
basic research tend to crowd out ideas for clinical research 
that compete for limited research dollars.
    The Director of the NIH has acknowledged a need for 
attention to the issues related to clinical research by 
appointing a panel on clinical research. This panel has begun 
its deliberations and will provide a series of recommendations 
that are based on the evolving contest in which biomedical 
research is funded.
    In practical terms, some feel the success of the 
discoveries into the understanding of basic mechanisms of 
biology and the molecular explanation of disease has fueled a 
commitment by study sections--those committees made up of peers 
who determine the merit ranking of submitted grants--to basic 
research. Clinical investigators have been less successful in 
competition with basic scientists for grant dollars. NIH is 
examining the issue of whether the composition of study 
sections has an influence on the success of these applications 
and what actions may need to be taken in this area.

3. Administrative simplification and efficiency

    Over the years, there has been a sense that increasing 
administrative burdens, many created by Congress, expend 
resources that could be better spent on research grants. The 
requirements for formal reports to Congress, while well-
intentioned with regard to protecting the taxpayers' 
investment, may have lost their value compared to newer and 
faster methods of keeping Congress informed. Reports that take 
months or years to produce, in traditional preparation and 
publication cycles, may be less useful than more specific 
response to timely questions from members of Congress. The 
annual appropriations process and the triennial authorization 
process provide just-in-time responses for those committees of 
jurisdiction on whom the responsibility for funding falls.
    In another context, reports from committees and councils of 
the NIH might be replaced in some instances by the publication 
of meeting minutes, or the electronic transmission of 
conclusions.
    Mandated meeting frequencies of advisory councils and 
committees could be replaced by as-needed meetings and the use 
of telecommunications technology and electronic communication 
for decision making.

4. Education and training of future biomedical scientist

    A growing concern is that medical graduates are shying away 
from the pursuit of careers in clinical research. The 
increasing cost of a medical education is said to discourage 
medical graduates from the prolonged training required for such 
careers. The average education loan for graduating physicians 
in 1996 is over $60,000. The insecurity of funding for clinical 
research and the reduced compensation associated with careers 
in research, compared to careers in clinical practice, often 
discourage young medical graduates from clinical research.
    A recent report from the Institute of Medicine of the 
National Academy of Sciences has made a series of 
recommendations based on their assessment of both the state of 
clinical research and the training of health care professionals 
for future careers in clinical research. the report recommended 
the establishment of funding mechanisms for new clinical 
investigators, a recommitment to support General Clinical 
Research Centers (those components of AHC's around the country 
in which patient-focused research takes place), and commitment 
by the Medical Scientist Training Program to a widened focus, 
including population-based research along with careful tracking 
of the graduates of this program.

          BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH POLICY AND THE FUTURE OF FUNDING

    The environment of relative shrinking growth in available 
funds is likely to continue. In spite of limited resources, 
there will be expanded horizons for basic research and 
increased opportunities for clinical applications of basic 
research findings. In addition, there will unquestionably be 
new and important implications in the areas of economic, 
bioethical, and health policies. Some of these new policy 
implications will be based on research findings leading to the 
understanding of genetic control of biologic and pathologic 
processes. Many conclude that greater management flexibility 
will be required for the NIH to respond to these rapid changes 
in health science and technology. Biomedical research funded by 
Federal dollars requires a delicate balance between the needs 
and expectations of the taxpayer who funds the research and 
researchers with increasingly sophisticated expertise who are 
best able to establish priorities for biomedical research.

             III. Legislative History and Committee Action

    The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 
1996, S. 1897, was introduced on June 21, 1996, by Senators 
Kassebaum, Kennedy, Jeffords, Pell, and Hatfield. The bill was 
referred to the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources.
    The Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources held 
hearings on the National Institutes of Health reauthorization 
on March 6 and 7, 1996, and May 7, 1996.
    On Wednesday, July 1996, the committee held an executive 
session to consider S. 1897. Four amendments were adopted in 
executive session by voice vote, and S. 1897 was ordered to be 
reported favorably to the full Senate by a rollcall vote of 16 
yeas.

       amendments adopted by voice vote during executive session

    Four amendments were adopted in executive session by voice 
vote.
    1. Senator Wellstone offered an amendment to establish a 
program for the support of research and training with respect 
to Parkinson's disease by establishing the Morris K. Udall 
Awards for Innovation in Parkinson's disease research at up to 
ten centers.
    2. Senators DeWine and Kennedy offered an amendment to 
establish within the Office of the Director of the NIH a 
Pediatric Research Initiative to increase pediatric biomedical 
research.
    3. Senator Simon offered an amendment to increase the 
authorization level of diabetes-related research by 25 percent 
each year over the 3 years of the authorization. Senator 
Mikulski modified the amendment to provide for a 25-percent 
increase over 3 years.
    4. Senator Frist offered an amendment to require the 
National Institutes of Health to prepare a report to the 
committee within 6 months of enactment of S.1897 explaining how 
it intends to implement the findings and recommendations of an 
earlier report to Congress entitled ``Support For 
Bioengineering Research,'' submitted in August 1995.

              amendment withdrawn during executive session

    1. Senators Faircloth and Harkin offered an amendment to 
establish a National Center for Pain Research within the 
National Institutes of Health and 6 regional centers for pain 
research. The amendment proposed to improve the integration of 
pain-related research at the National Institutes of Health 
through a new organizational structure. Senator Kassebaum and 
others expressed concern about the administrative burden 
associated with the creation of new centers. The amendment was 
withdrawn by the sponsors with the understanding that work 
would continue in an attempt to develop an alternative proposal 
for a floor manager's amendment.

                          IV. Committee Views

A. General overview of S. 1897

            1. General
    In crafting this legislation, the committee wrestled with 
the question: Should the Congress be directive and authorize 
more set-asides for specific diseases, or should it authorize 
institute funding that enables scientific discovery itself to 
determine the direction for research funding? In general, the 
committee tends toward the view that the latter is the better 
course: to make resources available to scientists to pursue new 
knowledge where it leads. The committee believes that this 
strategy has been highly productive in the National Institutes 
of Health's (NIH) assault on the diseases that afflict 
Americans.
            2. Renewal of expiring authorities

                                general

    This bill renews all expiring NIH authorities through 
fiscal year 1999. The committee recommends that institutes due 
for reauthorization be authorized at specific dollar amounts 
that have been increased to reflect biomedical research 
inflation. To determine the dollar amount to be authorized for 
1997, the committee has used the Biomedical Research and 
Development Price Index (BRDPI) compounded over the 3 years 
since the last reauthorization. This results in an increase in 
the amount from 1994 to 1997 of approximately 11 percent. The 
out years are reauthorized at such sums as may be necessary.
    On the other hand, the committee has taken the course of 
reauthorizing all other existing initiatives at such sums as 
may be necessary. The successful pursuit of science can rapidly 
change directions, particularly when breakthroughs point toward 
successful research strategies. This approach has the benefit 
of removing limits that exist over the duration of the 
reauthorization legislation so that funding can be determined 
annually by the appropriating process.

                       national cancer institute

    The progress that has been made in understanding the 
genetics of cancer has been gratifying. The discovery, for 
example, of the BRCA-1 gene that is linked to certain forms of 
breast cancer opens the door to a number of opportunities for 
screening and therapy. At the same time, it is recognized by 
the committee that each new discovery of this type introduces 
new social and ethical issues regarding the appropriate 
application of this new knowledge in a safe and reasoned way. 
The committee supports NCI's efforts to expand and intensify 
its activities with respect to cancer genetics and to 
coordinate its activities with other institutes and agencies 
with responsibilities in this area.
    It is also clear to the committee that the broad 
understanding of the biology of cancers of one kind is likely 
to be valuable in the understanding of cancers of other organs. 
While the previously created special programs in breast cancer, 
cancer of the female reproductive systems, and cancer of the 
prostate are all important programs, precise authorization 
amounts have not been set by the committee. Rather, funding 
levels will be determined through the annual appropriation 
process by Congress based on the success, and potential for 
success, of the science in these areas of research.

               national heart, lung, and blood institute

    The committee is pleased to note the progressive decline in 
heart disease mortality in all segments of society. This is 
certainly the result of coordinated research efforts into the 
understanding of heart disease and its therapy. It is also 
comment on the use of public health approaches to prevention. 
Yet today cardiovascular diseases remain one of the leading 
causes of death in this country. Approximately one million 
deaths each year are directly related to cardiovascular 
diseases. Clearly, a continued research effort in this area is 
needed.
    The committee is concerned about the increasing prevalence 
and severity of asthma in the United States. It is gratifying 
to see the application of patient education in asthma 
management techniques and their critical analysis. The 
demonstrated value of patient education and involvement in 
their own care superbly exemplifies how worthwhile it is to 
disseminate new knowledge gained from research directly to the 
patient for his or her personal benefit.
    While the results of clinical studies have produced 
improvement in the survival of the many Americans who are born 
with, and spend a lifetime with, sickle cell disease, it is 
hoped that new applications of molecular medicine will yield 
even more fundamental techniques for the relief of suffering 
from this disease.

         national institute of allergy and infectious diseases

    The reemergence of tuberculosis has presented a startling 
example of importance of NIH's ability to muster an agile 
response in the direction of research funding. With the various 
epidemiologic changes that occurred in the 1980's--such as 
immune suppression associated with HIV infection and new 
resistance to the usual antibiotics that treat tuberculosis--a 
new epidemic of tuberculosis emerged. The National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has made a substantial 
commitment to research on tuberculosis. Its program of 
incentives for new investigators to bring creative scientific 
thinking to the problems that have developed in the field of 
tuberculosis is a model for quick response to new imperatives 
in the study of disease, particularly emerging infections. The 
committee believes that the stabilization of the numbers of new 
cases of tuberculosis over the last 2 years demonstrates the 
ability of an energized infrastructure to respond to new health 
problems. It looks forward to even greater success in the 
reduction of this epidemic as basic research and clinical 
research come together for effective management of this complex 
health problem.
    In past years, NIH has made very large investments in 
upgrading research facilities in response to public concerns 
about animal well-being and to diminish environmental factors 
that adversely affect research. However, the programs in 
Comparative Medicine which focus on animal-based research have 
been severely curtailed. These programs address research in 
genetics, infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes and many other 
fields and should be strengthened.
            3. Increasing administrative efficiency

                                general

    During hearings before the committee, the Director of the 
NIH described additional efforts the agency is undertaking to 
streamline its research and administrative operations. The 
committee urges the Director to continue these efforts and 
remains committed to exploring mechanisms that will maximize 
the funds available for biomedical research.

              meetings of advisory committees and councils

    The committee is aware that the advent of 
telecommunications technology, permitting more rapid resolution 
of committee and council business and other administrative 
efficiencies, now makes it unnecessary to mandate meeting at 
designated intervals. This provides an opportunity for resource 
savings afforded by scheduling meetings only as needed. 
Unneeded meetings are wasteful of resources, including time and 
effort on the part of council or committee members and staff, 
as well as travel expenses and compensation for members.

             application of federal advisory committee act

    It is the view of the committee that scientific and peer 
review groups are integral components of the NIH grant-making 
process. The function of these specialized peer review groups 
is very different than the public advisory rule envisioned at 
the inception of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). It 
is appropriate, therefore, to exempt scientific and peer review 
groups from the provisions of FACA and the associated 
administration burden. This does not exempt from the provisions 
of FACA the many other advisory committees and councils that 
serve the many roles and functions of the NIH.

                 elimination or modification of reports

    It is the view of the committee that a number of reports 
required of the NIH by the Congress are sometimes duplicative 
and generally do not meet the intended goal of the original law 
that established their requirement. Under current law, the 
Director of the NIH and the directors of institutes and centers 
are required to provide administrative reports to the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services and Congress. There are now more 
effective mechanisms in place for communicating this 
information. Such mechanisms include publications (both printed 
and electronic), public testimony at the annual appropriations 
process and the triennial authorization process, as well as 
direct inquiry from members of the Congress.
    It is the intention of the committee that elimination of 
these reports will improve the efficiency of the individual 
institutes and centers by allowing staff to concentrate on the 
administration of research programs, rather than on producing 
reports that are often untimely and no longer useful for the 
Congress.

        increased amount of grants that require only peer review

    Grant funding by the NIH is approved by a two-tier process. 
After approval by a peer review committee, grants than must be 
approved by the appropriate institute or center advisory 
council. It is the view of the committee that increasing from 
$50,000 to $100,000 the amount for grants that can be made 
after scientific and technical peer review eliminates 
duplication of the approval process beyond peer review for 
smaller grants and accelerates funding of new, cutting-edge 
proposals.
    It is the view of the committee that this modification will 
streamline the workloads of the institutes, centers, and the 
National Library of Medicine, resulting in shortened time from 
review to award.

         elimination of certain advisory boards and committees

    The committee is aware that current law establishes certain 
advisory committees, boards, and commissions that no longer 
carry out the purposes for which they were created. In every 
instance, the advisory committee, boards, and commissions 
listed below no duplicate responsibilities and authorities that 
are better carried out by other entities.
    The functions of the National Diabetes Advisory Board, the 
National Digestive Disease Board, and the National Kidney and 
Urologic Diseases Advisory Board are adequately served by the 
National Diabetic and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Advisory 
Council. The purpose of the National Arthritis and 
Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Advisory Board is adequately 
served by the National Arthritis and Muscoloskeletal and Skin 
Diseases Advisory Council, as well as two interagency 
coordinating committees. The functions of the National Deafness 
and Other Communications Disorders Advisory Board overlap those 
served by the National Deafness and Other Communications 
Disorders Advisory Council. The National Commission on 
Alcoholism and Other Alcohol-Related Problems was activated 
briefly in 1980. Although funds were authorized, they were 
never appropriated, and it has remained inactive up to this 
time. The Advisory Council on Hazardous Substances Research and 
Training has completed its statutory mandate. Moreover, the 
functions of this council can be adequately served by the 
National Advisory Environmental Health Sciences Council.
    Accordingly, the committee expects that the repeal of these 
boards and committees will be associated with appropriate 
savings that can be used more effectively for funding of 
research grants.

                  the pain research consortium at nih

    The Committee encourages the NIH Director to establish a 
Pain Research Consortium. The creation of a Pain Research 
Consortium would provide a forum for coordinating pain research 
activities, sharing information about research and related 
activities being conducted in the area of pain, developing 
ideas for collaborative research efforts, avoiding unnecessary 
duplication of research efforts, and thereby, achieving a more 
efficient use of Federal dollars. All NIH Institutes, Centers 
and Offices that are involved in pain research should be 
included as members of the Consortium. In addition, the NIH 
Pain Research Consortium should seek the opinions and advice 
from private organizations interested in pain research, as well 
as staff of other Federal agencies involved in studies of pain.

            coordination of child abuse and neglect research

    The committee recognizes that despite the magnitude and 
significance of the problem of child abuse and neglect, 
research in this field has not yet been organized into an 
integrated organized base of knowledge. To increase the 
viability of the work currently being done by NIH regarding 
child maltreatment, the committee believes it is essential that 
the child abuse and neglect portfolio at the NIH and its 
relevant Institutes be better coordinated and focused. As an 
important first step the committee strongly recommends that the 
NIH convene a working group made up of representatives of its 
component organizations currently supporting research on child 
maltreatment. The committee further encourages this working 
group to hold a conference on child abuse and neglect to assess 
the state-of-the-science and make recommendations for a 
research agenda in this field; including in this conference 
relevant outside organizations and recognized experts in child 
maltreatment.
            4. National Human Genome Research Institute
    The committee is aware of the importance of emerging 
knowledge of the human genome for the understanding of disease 
and its effective treatment. As we go into the next millennium, 
knowledge of genes and gene products will radically alter the 
physician's approach to disease. The committee expects that 
methods advanced by the National Center for Human Genome 
Research will continue to evolve and to influence many aspects 
of medical science long after the human genome has been 
sequenced. The committee hopes that the elevation of the 
National Center for Genome Research to institute status will 
ensure a continued focus of NIH resources on important genetic 
research.
    The attention to ethical, social, and legal issues 
surrounding the genetic underpinnings of cancer and other 
diseases is a valuable investment. Therefore, the current 5 
percent of extramural funds set-aside for reviewing and funding 
proposals to address these issues is maintained in this 
institute's mission.
    The additional authorities that accompany institute status 
will help to increase efficiency in this new institute. The 
committee expects that elevation of the center to institute 
status will have no additional budgetary ramifications and will 
require no additional full time employees.
            5. Addressing the needs for expanded involvement in 
                    clinical research

                                GENERAL

    The committee is aware that there are unprecedented 
pressures on academic health centers as a result of the health 
care market transformations. These pressures occur particularly 
in price-competitive health care markets where managed care 
plans have strong incentives to direct patients away form 
academic health centers to sources of care with lower costs. 
Moreover, because of reduced clinical incomes, the loss of 
clinical practice revenue has had the effect of reducing a 
substantial source of support for clinical research. The 
committee recognizes the attention that has been brought to the 
need for sustained, high-quality clinical research by studies 
performed by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy 
of Sciences.
    The committee is pleased that the leadership of the NIH has 
undertaken its own study of the ramifications of these changes 
upon clinical research by appointing a group of leading experts 
to a panel of clinical research. The committee believes that 
the panel on clinical research should produce, as soon as 
possible, specific recommendations that will increase attention 
and resources for the dilemma faced by academic health centers 
in their efforts to translate basic knowledge into clinical 
applications for patients. There is a particular interest by 
some members of the committee for the panel to evaluate what, 
if any, of the financial burden for clinical research should be 
assumed by managed care providers. The committee expects that 
the NIH will continue to monitor the effects of the ever-
evolving market at regular intervals.

                   GENERAL CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTERS

    The committee sees the General Clinical Research Centers as 
potential sources of solutions to some of the problems faced by 
academic health centers as they seek to maintain their academic 
missions in this changing economic environment. General 
Clinical Research Centers, widely distributed as they are 
around the country, draw on a broad range of research strengths 
from their parent academic institutions.
    The committee expects to see increased interdisciplinary 
research in these settings, as well as greater usage of diverse 
settings for research such as ambulatory and even home settings 
that reduce costs compared to traditional inpatient research 
wards.

  CLINICAL RESEARCH CAREER ENHANCEMENT AND INNOVATIVE MEDICAL SCIENCE 
                                 AWARDS

    The committee recognizes the importance of sustaining 
exemplary careers of expert clinical investigators and the 
importance of rewarding exceptional research ideas brought 
forward by clinical investigators at all stages of their 
careers. The committee intends that, with specific 
authorization of such awards, careers that might otherwise 
become fallow without adequate support will instead continue to 
develop creative solutions to the many health dilemmas that are 
currently unsolved.
    It is the intention of the committee that only applications 
of exceptional merit will be funded. Only by maintaining such 
high standards can these awards be effective in sustaining 
valuable careers and leveraging creative new research concepts.
            6. Education and training for clinical research

                                GENERAL

    The committee is aware that an important resource for the 
future of clinical research is the training and education for 
the next generation of investigators. The increasing costs of 
medical education have discouraged medical graduates for 
pursuing careers in clinical research because of the prolonged 
training that is required and the reduced incomes that are 
associated with such career preparation.
    Nevertheless, there can be no shortcut to the excellence 
required for a career in patient-focused research. 
Consequently, even more creative strategies must be developed 
by the NIH to foster such training and careers.

                         RAISING LOAN REPAYMENT

    To encourage qualified health professionals to pursue 
training in clinical research, the committee considers it 
appropriate to increase the maximum level of qualified student 
loans that could be repaid for participation in clinical 
research training fellowships at the NIH campus in Bethesda, 
MD. In addition, the venues should be expanded to include 
General Clinical Research Centers located throughout the 
country in academic health centers. In view of the periodic 
emergence of research fields, the committee would like to see 
greater flexibility available to the NIH to determine areas of 
research where loan repayment may be granted.

                   Medical Scientist Training Program

    The Medical Scientist Training Program is a highly 
successful program that has provided support for exceptionally 
qualified students to pursue the M.D. as well as a Ph.D. in a 
particular field that prepares the recipient for a career in 
biomedical research. This program can be the source of the 
future faculties of medicine and biomedical research 
institutions.
    However, the fields in which the Ph.D. has been pursued 
have generally been the basic biologic sciences. On the other 
hand, the context of medicine and clinical research is changing 
dramatically. As managed care emerges as the dominant form of 
support for medical care, it becomes increasingly apparent that 
the sciences germane to population-focused research, as well as 
the economic components of care, must be part of the research 
training that is supported by Federal funds. The committee is 
aware that a study performed by the Institute of Medicine of 
the National Academy of Sciences has argued for broadening the 
fields wherein the Ph.D. may be obtained in the Medical 
Scientist Training Program. If the future faculties of medical 
schools are to prepare future physicians appropriately and 
soundly for their careers in medicine, those faculties must be 
composed of scholars in the broader fields of the population-
based sciences, such as epidemiology, biostatistics, medical 
economics, and bioethics. However, it is the opinion of the 
committee that, while the NIH is best qualified to set the 
targets whereby these goals can be achieved, it has not been 
aggressive in encouraging grantees to pursue such a strategy.
    The committee hopes that the NIH will closely track this 
program and be able to provide information in the future that 
may answer the following questions. What careers, in what 
disciplines, are pursued by previous recipients of support from 
this program? How many have pursued careers in the population-
focused fields described above? How successful is this program 
in retaining its graduates in academic careers?
            7. National Fund for Health Research
    The committee recognizes that the pressure is never-ending 
for increased funding for biomedical research created by 
expanding knowledge. Only one grant can be funded for every 
four applications approved by NIH peer-review groups. On the 
other hand, Federal support for the NIH must complete with the 
many other demands on the Federal budget.
    The committee believes the importance of biomedical 
research is such that additional sources of funding must be 
assured. Accordingly, a National Fund for Health Research is 
established in the Department of the Treasury. This trust fund 
will be on budget. The committee believes that establishing 
such a fund is in itself an important first step toward 
assuring sustainable support for the essential mission of 
biomedical research.

B. Overview of substantive changes to S. 1897 contained in legislation 
        adopted by the committee

            1. Pediatric research initiative
    The committee recognizes that developments in genetics and 
gene therapy are leading toward considerable growth in 
knowledge and opportunities in the prevention and treatment of 
diseases that affect children. Increased support for biomedical 
research at a fundamental level should lead to new treatments 
and cures for a variety of childhood diseases. Moreover, 
clinical effectiveness studies can potentially demonstrate how 
to improve the quality of care for children while reducing 
costs of care.
    It is the intention of the committee that the resources 
provided by the pediatric research initiative will be allocated 
among NIH institutes by the Director of the NIH for extramural 
research in consultation with the institutes and any external 
advisers that the Director determines to be appropriate. The 
Director is encouraged to consider a central role for the 
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in 
advising on the development of priorities and plans for 
allocation of funds. The Director should encourage trans-
institute initiatives.
            2. Diabetes research
    The committee is encouraged by the success of biomedical 
research in recent years into causes and management of problems 
associated with diabetes mellitus. However, given the striking 
increase in the number of patients with diabetes, there 
continues to be a compelling need for a new advances in this 
field. Accordingly, the committee calls for increased funding 
in this field so as to encourage new and creative research 
applications.
    It is anticipated that these funds would be applied 
wherever creative research is found. However, a coordinating 
and leadership role is recognized for both the National 
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and to 
the National Eye Institute in their initiatives directed 
specifically at this disease.
            3. Parkinson's disease research
    The committee is pleased to honor former Congressman Morris 
K. Udall, who was forced to end his 30-year service in the U.S. 
House of Representatives due to the disabling effects of 
Parkinson's disease. This amendment to S. 1897 is a modified 
form of a bill that has had bipartisan support by over half the 
Senate and a companion bill in the House that had similar 
broad-based support. It is intended to provide mechanisms to 
encourage expansion of the Federal Parkinson's research efforts 
in a speedy and effective way.
    The committee notes that the NIH has undertaken active 
efforts to coordinate initiatives in this area, particularly as 
reflected by the 1995 Parkinson's Disease Research Planning 
Workshop. The coordination and collaboration efforts that have 
grown out of this workshop should be continued. The committee 
expects that new funding will be used to attract outstanding 
neuroscientists with innovative ideas to the field of 
Parkinson's disease research.

                            V. Cost Estimate

    A letter form the Congressional Budget Office requested 
after committee action on July 17, 1996, has not been received 
to date, September 9, 1996. Due to time constraints, the CBO 
letter will appear in the Congressional Record at a later date, 
when it is received.

                    VI. Regulatory Impact Statement

    The committee has determined that there will be no increase 
in the regulatory burden of paperwork as the result of this 
bill.

                    VII. Section-by-Section Analysis

Section 1. Short title

    Section 1 cites the act as the ``National Institutes of 
Health Revitalization Act of 1996.''

    TITLE--PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

Section 101. Director's discretionary fund

    Section 101 amends section 402(i)(3) of the Public Health 
Service (PHS) Act by striking the authorized dollar amount and, 
instead, authorizes the Director's Discretionary Fund at such 
sums as may be necessary through fiscal year 1999.

Section 102. Children's vaccine initiative

    Section 102 amends section 404B(c) of the PHS Act by 
striking the authorized dollar amount and, instead, authorizes 
the Children's Vaccine Initiative at such sums as may be 
necessary through fiscal year 1999.

   TITLE II--PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTES

Section 201. Research on osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and related 
        bone disorders

    Section 201 amends section 409A(d) of the PHS Act by 
striking the authorized dollar amount and, instead, authorizes 
the programs related to research on osteoporosis, Paget's 
disease, and related bone disorders at such sums as may be 
necessary through fiscal year 1999.

Section 202. National Human Genome Research Institute

    Section 202 amends part C of title IV of the PHS Act, 
adding a new subpart 18 which establishes the National Human 
Genome Research Institute. Its purpose is to characterize the 
structure and function of the human genome, including mapping 
and sequencing of individual genes. This purpose includes: (1) 
planning and coordinating the research goal of the genome 
project; (2) reviewing and funding research proposals; (3) 
conducting and supporting research training; (4) coordinating 
international genome research; (5) communicating advances in 
genome research to the public; (6) reviewing and funding 
proposals to address the ethical, legal, and social issues 
associated with the genome project (including legal issues 
regarding patents); and (7) planning and administering 
intramural, collaborative, and field research to study human 
genetic disease. It allows the director of the institute to 
conduct and support research training for which fellowship 
support is not provided under section 487 (National Research 
Service Awards) and is not residency training of physicians or 
other health professionals. It allows the director of the 
institute to make funding available at a level that is at least 
5 percent of the total amount available for extramural research 
grants, for research in ethical, legal, and social issues with 
reference to genome research.
    It transfers all functions, personnel, assets, liabilities, 
contracts, property, records, unexpended balances, 
authorizations, allocations, and other funds of the National 
Center of Human Genome Research to the new National Human 
Genome Research Institute. It transfers to the new institute 
and continues in effect all legal documents of the center. It 
deems that all previous references to the center in Federal 
law, executive order, rule, or any document shall refer to the 
new institute.
    It authorizes the National Human Genome Research Institute 
at such sums as may be necessary through fiscal year 1999.

Section 203. Increased amount of grant and awards

    Section 203 amends section 405(b)(2)(B) of the PHS Act by 
increasing from $50,000 to $100,000 the award amount that an 
institute can grant on the basis of technical or peer review 
alone, thereby increasing flexibility and saving the time and 
administrative cost required for advisory council approval for 
smaller grants.

Section 204. Meetings of advisory committees and councils

    Section 204 amends section 406 of the PHS Act by 
eliminating required meeting schedules for advisory committees 
and councils. Specifically, it eliminates the requirements for 
institute advisory councils to meet three times yearly, and for 
the National Cancer Advisory Board and the advisory council of 
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to meet four 
times yearly. It amends section 415(a)(3) of the PHS Act by 
eliminating the requirement for the President's Cancer Panel to 
meet four times a year.
    It amends section 429(b) of the PHS Act by eliminating the 
requirement for the Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and 
Kidney Interagency Coordinating Committees to meet four times a 
year.
    It amends section 439(b) of the PHS Act by eliminating the 
requirement for the Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal 
and Skin Diseases Interagency Coordinating Committees to meet 
four times a year.
    It amends section 464E(d) of the PHS Act by eliminating the 
requirement for the Institute on Deafness and Other 
Communication Disorders Interagency Coordinating Committees to 
meet four times a year
    It amends section 464X(e) of the PHS Act by eliminating the 
requirement for the Institute of Nursing Research Advisory 
Council to meet three times a year.
    It amends Part B of title IV of the PHS Act to create 
section 409B eliminating the application of the provisions of 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. Ap. 2) to 
scientific and peer-review groups of the National Institutes of 
Health established under title IV.

Section 205. Elimination or modification of reports

    Section 205 repeals section 403 of the PHS Act eliminating 
the biennial report of the Director of the National Institutes 
of Health to Congress and the President.
    It repeals section 439(c) of the PHS Act eliminating the 
annual report of the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases 
Interagency Coordinating Committee and the annual report of the 
Skin Diseases Interagency Coordinating Committee.
    It repeals section 442(j) of the PHS Act eliminating the 
annual report of the National Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and 
Skin Diseases Advisory Board.
    It repeals section 494A(b) of the PHS Act eliminating the 
annual report of the Secretary of Health and Human Services on 
health services research relating to alcohol abuse and 
alcoholism, drug abuse, and mental health.
    It repeals section 503(b) of the PHS Act eliminating the 
triennial report of the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
to Congress relating to alcoholism, alcohol abuse, and drug 
abuse.
    It amends section 402(f)(3) changing the reporting 
requirement from annual to biennial for the report to the 
Director of the National Institutes of Health concerning 
prevention activities undertaken by the Associate Director for 
Prevention.
    It repeals section 429(c) of the PHS Act eliminating the 
annual reports of the Coordinating Committees on Digestive 
Diseases, Diabetes Mellitus, and Kidney, Urologic, and 
Hematologic Diseases.
    It repeals section 304 of the Home Health Care and 
Alzheimer's Disease Amendments of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 242q-3) 
eliminating the annual report of the Task Force on Aging.
    It repeals subsections (b) and (c) of section 1122 of the 
PHS Act eliminating the annual reports related to sudden infant 
death syndrome.
    It repeals subsection (h) of section 5 of the International 
Health Research Act of 1960 eliminating the annual report of 
the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program.
    The bill instructs the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, acting through the Director of the National 
Institutes of Health, to report to the Congress on plans 
regarding how the findings of the report to Congress entitled 
``Support for Bioengineering Research,'' submitted in August 
1995, will be implemented.

Conforming amendments

    The bill amends section 404C(c) of the PHS Act making 
available a periodic revision of a plan regarding the use of 
animals for research to the Interagency Coordinating Committee 
on the Use of Animals in Research for inclusion in its minutes. 
This plan previously was provided to the Director of the 
National Institutes of Health for the biennial report of the 
Director.
    The bill amends section 404E(d)(3)(B) of the PHS Act by 
eliminating the requirement for the submission of the biennial 
report of the Office of Alternative Medicine for inclusion in 
the biennial report of the Director of the National Institutes 
of Health. The director of the office will continue to prepare 
the biennial report.
    The bill amends section 406(g) of the PHS Act by 
eliminating the need for advisory councils of the institutes to 
submit comments for inclusion in the biennial report of the 
Director of the National Institutes of Health.
    The bill amends section 407 of the PHS Act by changing the 
section heading to ``REPORTS'' and eliminating the requirement 
for the director of each national research institute to submit 
a report for inclusion in the biennial report of the Director 
of the National Institutes of Health.
    The bill amends section 416(b) of the PHS Act by 
eliminating the requirement for submission by the Associate 
Director for Prevention of the National Cancer Institute of the 
prevention activities of hat institute for inclusion in the 
biennial report of the Director of the National Institutes of 
Health. This report will be submitted directly to the Associate

VIII. ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF SENATORS COATS, DeWINE, FAIRCLOTH, GREGG, AND 
                                ASHCROFT

    This bill goes far toward supporting, continuing, and 
revitalizing the essential work of the National Institutes of 
Health and we are pleased to have supported its passage.
    However, we are concerned that the bill fails to address 
serious issues regarding the use of Federal funds made 
available through programs authorized by this bill to 
experiment on human embryos and fetuses--unborn children--some 
of them living at the time of the research; others made 
available by induced abortion.
    Data from the National Institutes of Health confirms that 
substantial Federal funds--millions of dollars--are spent on 
research using human fetuses. We are alarmed by such 
experimentation on these humans in these circumstances. We 
suggest that the public is not well served when taxpayer funds 
are used for research that is opposed by millions and millions 
of Americans as fundamentally unethical. We question whether 
medical science is best advanced by using scarce research funds 
in this way when acceptable alternative therapies and sources 
of tissue might more productively be explored.
