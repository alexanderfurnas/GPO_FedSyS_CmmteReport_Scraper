 Mr. Shuster, from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, 
                        submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 3576]

      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

    The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, to whom 
was referred the bill (H.R. 3576) to designate the United 
States courthouse located at 401 South Michigan Street in South 
Bend, Indiana, as the ``Robert Kurtz Rodibaugh United States 
Courthouse'', having considered the same, report favorably 
thereon with amendments and recommend that the bill as amended 
to pass.
    The amendments are as follows:
    Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu 
thereof the following:

SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.

    The United States courthouse located at 401 South Michigan Street 
in South Bend, Indiana, shall be known and designated as the ``Robert 
K. Rodibaugh United States Bankruptcy Courthouse.''.

SEC. 2. REFERENCES.

    Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the United States courthouse referred to 
in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``Robert K. 
Rodibaugh United States Bankruptcy Courthouse''.

    Amend the title so as to read:

    A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at 401 
South Michigan Street in South Bend, Indiana, as the ``Robert K. 
Rodibaugh United States Bankruptcy Courthouse''.

    Judge Robert Kurtz Rodibaugh served the Northern District 
of Indiana in the area of bankruptcy law since his appointment 
as a bankruptcy judge in 1960.
    Judge Rodibaugh was born in Elkhart County, near Goshen, 
Indiana. He attended South Bend grade schools and high school, 
and he received his undergraduate and doctorate from the 
University of Notre Dame. After gaining his admittance to 
practice law in 1941, Judge Rodibaugh entered the military 
service. He served in the United States Army during World War 
II, returning to private practice in 1946.
    In 1948, Judge Rodibaugh began his career in public service 
as Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for the Indiana 60th Judicial 
Circuit. He served in this capacity from 1948 to 1950, and 
again from 1953 to 1957. Judge Rodibaugh also served as the 
Attorney for the St. Joseph County Board of Zoning Appeals, in 
1958.
    It was in 1960 that Judge Rodibaugh began his service to 
the bankruptcy court when he was appointed a United States 
Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of Indiana, the 
title then known as the Bankruptcy Referee of the United States 
District Court. Judge Rodibaugh presided over the growth of the 
bankruptcy court from one small courtroom with a part time 
referee and a clerk's office of four employees in South Bend, 
Indiana, to four courtroom locations in the cities of South 
Bend, Fort Wayne, Gary, and Lafayette, Indiana, with four full 
time judges and a clerk's office of over forty employees. In 
1985, he was appointed Chief Bankruptcy Judge, and assumed 
senior status in 1986.
    Judge Rodibaugh fulfilled his duties as a referee in 
bankruptcy proceedings and bankruptcy judge with patience, 
fairness, dedication and legal scholarship which is most worthy 
of recognition. It is a fitting tribute to name this building 
in his honor.

                        compliance with rule xi

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives:
          (1) The Subcommittee held a hearing and markup on 
        this legislation on July 31, 1996;
          (2) The requirements of section 308(a)(1) of the 
        Congressional Budget Act of 1974 are not applicable to 
        this legislation since it does not provide new budget 
        authority or new or increased tax expenditures;
          (3) The Committee has received no report from the 
        Committee on Government Reform and Oversight of 
        oversight findings and recommendations arrived at under 
        clause 4(C)(2) of rule X of the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives;
          (4) With respect to clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of 
        the Rules of the House of Representatives and section 
        403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, a cost 
        estimate by the Congressional Budget Office was 
        received by the Committee.
    The report follows:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                    Washington, DC, August 6, 1996.
Hon. Bud Shuster,
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of 
        Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 3576, a bill to designate the United States 
courthouse located at 401 South Michigan Street in South Bend, 
Indiana, as the ``Robert Kurtz Rodibaugh United States 
Courthouse,'' as ordered reported by the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure on August 1, 1996. We 
estimate that enacting H.R. 3576 would result in no significant 
cost to the federal government. The bill would not affect 
direct spending or receipts; therefore, pay-as-you-go 
procedures would not apply.
    In addition, H.R. 3576 contains intergovernmental or 
private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) and would not affect the 
budgets of state, local, or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is John R. 
Righter.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                     inflationary impact statement

    Under (2)(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives, the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure estimates that enactment of H.R. 3576 will have 
no significant inflationary impact on prices and costs in the 
operation of the national economy.

                          cost of legislation

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires a statement of the estimated cost to 
the United States which will be incurred in carrying out H.R. 
3576, as reported, in fiscal year 1997, and each of the 
following five years. Implementation of this legislation is not 
expected to result in any increased costs to the United States.

                       committee action and vote

    In compliance with clause (2)(l)(2) (A) and (B) of rule XI 
of the Rules of the House of Representatives, at a meeting of 
the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on August 1, 
1996, a quorum being present, H.R. 3576 was unanimously 
approved by a voice vote and ordered reported.
