                          PURPOSE OF THE BILL

    The purpose of H.R. 2122 is to designate the Lake Tahoe 
Basin National Forest in the States of California and Nevada to 
be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture.

                  BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATION

    The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU) of the 
National Forest System is made up of portions of three national 
forests, including the Tahoe and Eldorado National Forests in 
California (Region 5) and the Toiyabe National Forest in Nevada 
(Region 4). Since 1973 the Forest Service has administered 
these lands (approximately 152,000 acres) as a single 
management unit. Management of the unit is guided by a single 
LTBMU land management plan, which was adopted by the agency in 
1988.
    H.R. 2122 would change the designation of the management 
unit to the Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest. The bill would 
not change the way the lands are managed by the agency. The 
Forest Service supported similar legislation in the 102d 
Congress.

                            COMMITTEE ACTION

    H.R. 2122 was introduced on July 26, 1995, by Congresswoman 
Barbara F. Vucanovich (R-NV) and Congressman John T. Doolittle 
(R-CA). The bill was referred to the Committee on Resources, 
and additionally to the Committee on Agriculture. Within the 
Committee on Resources, the bill was referred to the 
Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Lands. On June 6, 
1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 2122, where there 
was no opposition to the bill. On June 27, 1996, the 
Subcommittee met to mark up H.R. 2122. An amendment was offered 
by Congressman James V. Hansen (R-UT) to ensure that the 
designation encompasses all lands included in the management 
area since it was established in 1973. The amendment, requested 
by the Administration, was adopted by voice vote. The bill was 
then ordered favorably reported to the Full Committee. On July 
17, 1996, the Full Resources Committee met to consider H.R. 
2122. No further amendments were offered and the bill as 
amended was ordered favorably reported to the House of 
Representatives by voice vote in the presence of a quorum.

                      SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS

Section 1. Designation

    This section designates the Lake Tahoe Basin National 
Forest as a unit of the National Forest System, subject to the 
laws, rules, and regulations Applicable to the National Forest 
System.

Section 2. Boundaries

    The boundaries of the Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest 
shall comprise those lands currently designated as the Lake 
Tahoe Basin Management Unit (LTBMU). The boundaries of the 
Tahoe, Eldorado and Toiyabe National Forests are modified to 
exclude the lands within the boundaries of the Lake Tahoe Basin 
National Forest.

Section 3. Land management planning

    The land management plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin 
Management Unit shall constitute the plan for the newly 
designated Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest. Section 3 also 
specifies that this Act does not require the Forest Service to 
amend or revise the LTBMU plan or any draft or final land 
management plans for the Tahoe, Eldorado and Toiyabe National 
Forests.

Section 4. Administrative provisions

    This section specifies that any reference to the LTBMU in 
any existing statute, regulation, manual, handbook, or 
otherwise shall be deemed a reference to the Lake Tahoe Basin 
National Forest. It also specifies that the Act shall not 
affect any provisions of Public Law 96-551 giving Congressional 
consent to the Tahoe Planning Compact; Public Law 96-586 
providing for disposal of certain Federal lands in the Lake 
Tahoe Basin; or valid existing rights of persons holding any 
authorization, permit, option or other form of contract 
existing on the date of enactment of the Act. Finally, it 
specifies that distribution of receipts from the Eldorado, 
Tahoe, Toiyabe and the Lake Tahoe Basin National Forests shall 
be based upon the National Forest boundaries that existed prior 
to enactment of the Act.

            COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and clause 
2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives 
the Committee on Resources' oversight findings and 
recommendations are reflected in the body of this report.

                     INFLATIONARY IMPACT STATEMENT

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that the 
enactment of H.R. 2122 will have no significant inflationary 
impact on prices and costs in the operation of the national 
economy.

                        COST OF THE LEGISLATION

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires an estimate and a comparison by the 
Committee of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out 
H.R. 2122. However, clause 7(d) of that Rule provides that this 
requirement does not apply when the Committee has included in 
its report a timely submitted cost estimate of the bill 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                     COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSE RULE XI

    1. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(B) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, H.R. 
2122 does not contain any new budget authority, spending 
authority, credit authority, or an increase or decrease in 
revenues or tax expenditures.
    2. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(D) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee has received no report of oversight findings and 
recommendations from the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight on the subject of H.R. 2122.
    3. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(C) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the 
Committee has received the following cost estimate for H.R. 
2122 from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                     Washington, DC, July 26, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources,
 House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 2122, a bill to designate the Lake Tahoe Basin 
National Forest in the states of California and Nevada to be 
administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, and for other 
purposes. The bill was ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Resources on July 17, 1996. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 
2122 would have no significant impact on the federal budget. 
The bill would not affect direct spending or receipts; 
therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.
    H.R. 2122 would designate the Lake Tahoe Basin Management 
Unit as the Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest. The management 
unit includes portions of the Eldorado, Tahoe, and Toiyabe 
National Forests. The bill would adjust the boundaries of those 
national forests to exclude the lands within the boundaries of 
the new Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest. The bill specifies 
that the distribution of receipts from Eldorado, Tahoe, 
Toiyabe, and Lake Tahoe Basin National Forests would be based 
on the national forest boundaries existing prior to enactment 
of the bill. Therefore, distribution of receipts to state and 
local governments would remain unchanged relative to current 
law.
    H.R. 2122 contains no private-sector or intergovernmental 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would have no impact on the budgets of 
state, local, or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Victoria V. 
Heid.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                    COMPLIANCE WITH PUBLIC LAW 104-4

    H.R. 2122 contains no unfunded mandates.

                        changes in existing law

    If enacted, H.R. 2122 would make no changes in existing 
law.
                            A P P E N D I X

                              ----------                              

                     U.S. House of Representatives,
                                  Committee on Agriculture,
                                   Washington, DC, August 15, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources, Longworth House Office Building, 
        Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for forwarding a draft copy of 
the Committee report for H.R. 2122, a bill to designate the 
Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest in the States of California 
and Nevada to be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, 
as ordered reported by your Committee.
    The Committee on Agriculture received an additional 
referral of H.R. 2122 and the subject matter of the bill is 
within this Committee's jurisdiction. However, in the interest 
of expediting consideration of H.R. 2122 and the interest both 
of our Committees have in ensuring that this bill, as you have 
reported it, is acted on promptly after this August Recess, 
this Committee is willing to waive further consideration of 
this bill so as to advance its early consideration in the 
House.
    This action is not intended to waive this Committee's 
jurisdiction over this matter for all purposes, and should this 
legislation go to conference, this Committee reserves the right 
to request to be included as conferees on any provision within 
the Committee on Agriculture's jurisdiction in the event of a 
House-Senate conference on this bill or its Senate equivalent.
    Once again, I appreciate your cooperation in this matter 
and look forward to working with you on matters of shared 
jurisdiction between our respective committees.
            Sincerely,
                                             Pat Roberts, Chairman.
