_______________________________________________________________________


    Mr. Linder, from the Committee on Rules, submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                       [To accompany H. Res. 516]

    The Committee on Rules, having had under consideration 
House Resolution 516, by a nonrecord vote, report the same to 
the House with the recommendation that the resolution be 
adopted.

               brief summary of provisions of resolution

    The resolution provides for the consideration of H.R. 3719, 
the ``Small Business Programs Improvement Act of 1996'' under 
an open rule. The rule provides one hour of general debate 
divided equally between the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Small Business.
    The rule waives points of order against the bill and its 
consideration for failure to comply with clause 2(l)(2)(B) of 
rule XI (requiring rollcall votes to be printed in committee 
reports). The rule also waives points of order against the 
committee amendment in the nature of a substitute for failure 
to comply with clause 5(a) of rule XXI (prohibiting 
appropriations in an authorization measure).
    Members who have preprinted their amendments in the 
Congressional Record prior to their consideration will be given 
priority in recognition to offer their amendments if otherwise 
consistent with House rules. The rule allows the Chairman of 
the Committee of the Whole to postpone votes during 
consideration of the bill, and to reduce to five minutes the 
voting time on a postponed question if the vote follows a 
fifteen minute vote. Finally, the rule provides for one motion 
to recommit, with or without instructions.
