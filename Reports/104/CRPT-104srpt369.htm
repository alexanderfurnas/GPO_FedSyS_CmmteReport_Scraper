                               I. Purpose

    Existing Federal law has not been sufficiently effective in 
preventing youth violence or in ensuring the punishment of 
juvenile offenders. The costs of these failures in human and 
monetary terms on American society is enormous. Today, young 
people are the most violent segment of society, and there is 
little reason to believe that a continuation of present Federal 
policy is likely to reduce youth crime.
    The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention 
(OJJDP) has been successful in implementing the mandates that 
have safeguarded the rights of young people in the criminal 
justice system. Nonetheless, it continues to focus on those 
mandates while ineffective prevention programs and inadequate 
punishments fail to stop a dramatic increase in youth crime, 
and violent youth crime in particular.
    S. 1952 seeks to make the most significant changes in the 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) since 
its original enactment in 1974. The legislation renames OJJDP 
as the Office of Youth Violence Reduction and limits its 
authority to awarding grants and ensuring compliance with 
statutory requirements. The stature of the National Institute 
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (NIJJDP) is 
enhanced, as are its responsibilities and budgetary authority. 
These changes are designed to ensure that the Federal 
Government's policy toward youth violence is focused on those 
activities that the Federal Government can perform best, that 
are appropriately Federal, and that, while exceedingly 
important, would be unlikely to be undertaken by State or local 
levels of government. Specifically, because OJJDP has not 
adequately performed its functions of, nor been adequately 
funded to undertake, research, evaluation, and dissemination of 
information concerning successful youth crime prevention 
programs, the bill emphasizes these roles for NIJJDP.
    Second, S. 1952 eliminates many bureaucratic and procedural 
requirements of current law that in the Committee's view serve 
no purpose, makes more flexible each of the remaining mandates, 
and expands the purposes of the current law's formula grants to 
recognize that prevention and intervention can be enhanced if 
graduated punishments are made a mainstay of the juvenile 
justice system. Third, the legislation reauthorizes the Runaway 
and Homeless Youth Act and Missing Children's Assistance Act. 
And fourth, the legislation repeals authorizations for programs 
for which there is little or no evidence of success in 
preventing youth violence and reallocates those funds to 
research, evaluation, technical assistance, training, and 
dissemination of information concerning scientifically 
evaluated crime prevention programs.

                        II. Legislative History

    Congress enacted the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention Act in 1974 in response to conditions then prevalent 
in the juvenile justice system in the States. Spurred by 
reports of dangerous conditions in which juveniles accused or 
convicted of crimes, or even offenses that would not be crimes 
if committed by an adult, were housed, Congress passed 
legislation to provide States assistance with juvenile justice. 
As a condition of receipt of these funds, States were required 
to comply with two original mandates, later expanded to four, 
that protected the rights of accused and adjudicated juveniles. 
The legislation also established OJJDP and directed it to 
dispense formula grants to States and monitor their compliance 
with the mandates. In addition, the legislation established 
within OJJDP a research, demonstration, evaluation, and 
information dissemination component. Congress has reauthorized 
the legislation in 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992. In each 
reauthorization, new mandates have been added, and new Federal 
discretionary grant programs have been created, but the basic 
approach of the statute has remained largely unchanged.
    Unfortunately, while current legislation achieved the goals 
of protecting youth, it has not been able to address the 
changed nature of the problem that exists today. Despite the 
effort to establish a Federal entity to conduct research on the 
subject, and in part due to a shortage of resources, little 
more is known about addressing youth violence today than was 
the case in 1974. In the meantime, even as the nature, scope, 
and severity of youth crime changed dramatically in the 1980's 
and 1990's, OJJDP focused excessively on mandates that relate 
to neither crime prevention nor punishment, and that, while 
important, have long ago been achieved.
    For these reasons, the Subcommittee on Youth Violence 
conducted a series of hearings to reexamine the legislation 
with the recognition that substantial changes were required. It 
was the Subcommittee's intention to hold hearings, and then 
introduce a bill that reflected the testimony of the witnesses 
who appeared.
    The Subcommittee held a field hearing in Memphis, TN, on 
February 15, 1996, on developing local solutions to youth 
violence. Witnesses included Johnny Rawls, a graduate of the 
Youth Habilitation Center; a youth offender; Francetta Harris, 
the owner of a Memphis hair salon; Charlesetta Temple of the 
Douglass Elementary School Alumni; Erika Davis, a high school 
student and founder of Students Against Violence Everywhere;

for the Western District of Tennessee; the Honorable John 
Pierotti, district attorney general; Dr. Robert Wood of the 
Agency for Youth and Family Development; Barbara Holden, 
executive director, Memphis and Shelby County Community Health 
Agency; Dan Michael, administrator, Court Appointed Special 
Advocates; Billy Crouch of Tennessee Home Ties; and Chaplain 
Carl Nelson of the Mark Luttrell Recreation Center.
    On February 16, 1996, the Subcommittee held a field hearing 
in Nashville, TN, on developing State solutions to youth 
violence. The witnesses were the Honorable Don Sundquist, 
Governor of Tennessee; George Hattaway, the Commissioner of 
Youth Development; the Honorable Douglas Henry, Tennessee 
Senate; the Honorable Page Walley, Tennessee House of

coordinator, Child and Family Services; the Honorable Paul 
Wohlford, juvenile judge; the Honorable Randy Camp, juvenile 
judge; the Honorable Dan Speer, mayor, Pulaski, TN; the 
Honorable Bernie Swiney, mayor, Loudon, TN; and the Honorable 
C. Van Deacon, juvenile judge.
    The Subcommittee held a hearing in Washington, DC, on 
February 28, 1996, on the changing nature of youth violence. 
The Subcommittee heard as witnesses Dr. James Alan Fox, dean, 
College of Criminal Justice, Northeastern University; Dr. 
Alfred Blumstein, professor, Carnegie-Mellon University; Dr.

State and local government officials, nonprofit agency 
personnel, judges, police officers, and juvenile crime victims.
    Senator Thompson, joined by Senator Biden, introduced S. 
1952, on July 12, 1996.

                               Discussion

                       a. changes in youth crime

    The Juvenile Justice Act was enacted at a time when 
juveniles tended to commit fewer, less violent, and less 
geographically dispersed crimes than today. The growing fear of 
crime in this country over the last 10 years tracks precisely 
the shocking escalation in the number of violent crimes 
committed by juveniles. Since 1985, the murder rate for adults 
older than 25 has decreased by 25 percent. Over the same 
period, homicides by persons 18-24 have risen 61 percent. And 
among those 14-17, despite recent figures showing a 1-year 
reduction, the corresponding increase is 172 percent. Today, 
youths commit 300 percent more gun homicides than 10 years ago.
    Until the mid-1980's, the murder rate of juveniles was the 
same as for adults over 25, and less than half the rate of 
persons 18-24. Today, it is four times higher than that of 
adults, and two-thirds the rate of young adults. These 
increases reflect increased violence by all segments of youth. 
African-American youth homicide rates have risen 120 percent 
over the last decade, but white youth homicide rates have also 
increased by 80 percent. The sad fact today is that arrest 
rates for violent crimes are higher for teenagers than for 
adults. As Professor Fox testified, ``Conventional wisdom in 
criminology--that young adults generally represent the most 
violent-prone group--apparently needs to be modified in light 
of these disturbing changes.'' Violent juvenile arrests soared 
46 percent from 1989 to 1994, and there are today 150 percent 
more youth offenders than there were in 1984. While 1995 
figures show a decline in youth crime rates, the Subcommittee 
learned that Memphis, for instance, also reported a 1-year drop 
after a decade of increase in youth violence, but the rate 
resumed its upward trend this year. The problem is pervasive 
and is likely to deteriorate further.
    As Professor Fox testified, ``It is doubtful that today's 
improving crime picture will last for very long. This is the 
calm before the crime storm.'' He noted that today's violent 
youth are being succeeded by 39 million children in this 
country under age 10, a larger number than at any time since 
the baby boomers were in grade school. By 2005, there will be a 
14-percent increase in teenagers, including a 17 percent 
increase in black teens and a 30-percent rise in the number of 
Hispanic teens. The current increase in youth violence has 
occurred even as there was a drop in the number of teenagers, 
but the teen population will rise for the next decade, 
Professor Fox points out. As Senator Biden's December 1995 
report, ``Facing the Future,'' documented, the Nation faces a 
significant increase in youth violence over this period simply 
due to demographics even if crime rates among young people 
stabilized. But given the increase in the number of at-risk 
youth over that time and the deterioration in societal 
institutions and norms, Professor Fox believes ``our nation 
faces a future bloodbath of juvenile violence that will make 
1996 look like the good old days.''
    Both the nature of the problem and the conditions that have 
produced the increase in its severity and prevalence have 
changed remarkably since 1974. Commissioner Hattaway described 
how today's young people are committing murder, rape, 
aggravated robbery, assault, weapons charges, and drug 
trafficking. Senator Henry cited studies showing that 10 
percent of boys in high-risk neighborhoods had committed at 
least one street crime by age 7. The studies conclude that the 
earlier a person starts committing crimes, the more serious the 
crimes that are ultimately committed. Numerous witnesses 
testified that today's young offenders frequently show no 
remorse at all for very serious crimes. Professor DiIulio 
testified that young offenders are so violent that adult 
prisoners are afraid of many of them. His interviews with adult 
prisoners attribute the existence of youth predators to ``the 
absence of people, families, adults, teachers, preachers, 
coaches who would care enough about young males to nurture and 
discipline them.''
    Judge Carol Kelly of Chicago spent 15 years as a prosecutor 
before becoming a juvenile court judge, ``and I was never so 
frightened as I have been over the past two years in juvenile 
court.'' She described the heartbreaking cases on her docket:

        A ten year old boy who had acid poured on his head by 
        another juvenile and is now hideously disfigured; a 
        four year old girl who was stabbed 15 times by a 15 
        year old girl and who has scars all over her body; the 
        13 year old who was shot 11 times and may never walk 
        again; the children who are sexually assaulted and 
        abused by other children.

She also testified that there were numerous cases of children 
7, 8, or 9 years of age who appeared before her court on gun 
possession charges. Although it was an extremely uncommon 
occurrence for her in adult court, Judge Kelly testified that 
there were a dozen juvenile cases against offenders that were 
dismissed because the accused was killed before trial.
    Judge Kelly sentenced to prison the youngest person in 
America serving such a sentence. A 10- and an 11-year-old 
dropped a 5-year-old out a 14-story window because he would not 
steal candy for them. The 5-year-old's brother ran down 14 
flights of stairs in a vain attempt to try to catch his 
brother. Judge Kelly told the Subcommittee that ``many young 
violent offenders do not see anything wrong with their violent 
acts.'' Col. Gordon testified to the growing violent nature of 
youth crime that occurs at ever earlier ages. In Delaware, a 
high school student recently brought a live grenade to school. 
A police officer was permanently disabled when a juvenile who 
had stolen a car refused to surrender and intentionally drove 
the car at the officer. The youth pinned the officer under the 
front wheels and nearly killed him. This juvenile showed no 
remorse.
    Professor Fox and Professor Blumstein testified that the 
increased possession of guns by young people is particularly 
troubling. A 14-year-old is more willing to use a firearm over 
a trivial matter than is an adult because he does not fully 
appreciate the consequences and is less likely to exercise 
restraint.
    Judge Turner and Judge Kelly testified that most crimes by 
youth today are related to the drug trade, as are a large 
number of child neglect and nonsupport cases. Professor DiIulio 
also attributes the increase in youth violence to drug abuse 
and child abuse. Drugs not only are involved in specific 
violent incidents, such as the drug-addicted 10-year-old in 
Judge Kelly's case, but they are a key factor in producing a 
generation of youth that is far more violent than its 
predecessors. Drug-addicted parents regularly abuse and neglect 
children, and crack babies that suffer physical addiction to 
drugs from in utero exposure often are unable to control their 
behavior. Judge Kelly attributes much of the increase in youth 
violence to the abuse and neglect that these and other at-risk 
individuals faced. Today, some young persons have grandparents 
who are addicted to drugs.
    Witnesses before the Subcommittee tied the increase in 
youth violence to the decline of the family, neighborhoods, 
poor schools and a failed juvenile justice system, all of which 
are occurring as the influence grows of drugs, guns, and gangs. 
A Tennessee juvenile judge indicated that parents frequently 
fail to teach children respect for people or property. Instead, 
parents of troubled youth do what they want and leave their 
children to develop from their street environment. Mayor Speer 
described how parents and children have lost a sense of 
responsibility and respect for others. Judge Deacon and Rev. 
Rivers attributed that loss of responsibility to a government 
that has usurped the functions of communities, churches, and 
families, so that no one has to be responsible. Parental 
rejection and noninvolvement abounds. Judge Camp has ordered 
parents and children in the juvenile justice system to tell 
each other that they love each other. Many youths have told him 
that their mother had never told them that before.
    Indeed, compared with 1974, children have far less contact 
with caring adults. Today, fewer children are being raised in 
traditional, two-parent families. Professor Fox told the 
Subcommittee that ``as many as 57 percent of children in 
America do not have full-time parental supervision, either 
living with a single parent who works full-time or in a two-
parent household with both parents working full-time.'' The 
decline of the two-parent family has meant that children have 
more contact with adults who are potential abusers. Judge 
Deacon testified that the most dangerous person to a child is 
the mother's boyfriend. Young people today are frequently 
unsupervised after school, and Professor Fox provided the 
Subcommittee with figures that the after-school hours are the 
prime time period for youth violence.
    Even families that are nominally together may have little 
impact on keeping children away from crime. The younger 
offender in the case before Judge Kelly came from a two-parent 
family where both parents were substance abusers.
    Professor Blumstein attributed the growth in youth violence 
to crack cocaine, which led to an increase in adult 
incarcerations. With fewer adults available to enter into the 
drug trade, more youth were recruited. By carrying drugs or 
drug money, youths needed protection and obviously could not 
call on the police for that protection. He traced the increase 
in youths carrying guns to this phenomenon, and the need for 
other youths to carry guns for protection.
    Unlike 1974, youth violence occurs everywhere. Rural areas 
also face violent youth, Col. Gordon pointed out. Judge Deacon 
related that smaller communities have youth crime that has 
changed from shoplifting, joyriding, status offenses, and 
misdemeanors to rape, armed robbery, and gang activity. Rural 
communities, he said, ``are no longer dealing with isolated, 
random acts of violence, but increasingly with hardened, 
violent young offenders. * * *'' Chief Carson mentioned that 
sixth, seventh, and eighth graders in a small rural city have 
threatened assault on a teacher.

                             B. PREVENTION

    Not only do the experts agree on the factors that are 
producing youth violence, they have similar ideas concerning 
the approaches that should be taken to address the problem. 
While Professor DiIulio and others recognized that the nature 
of today's youth crime problem will mean the incarceration of 
more youths, he and all other witnesses concluded that youth 
violence will not be eradicated simply by incarcerating more 
juveniles. U.S. Attorney Coleman believes that it is simply not 
possible to lock up all offenders forever. Others, such as 
Judge Kelly, stress the enormous cost of juvenile 
incarceration, as well as the huge number of youth offenders, 
as reasons why America cannot simply build its way out of the 
youth violence problem. Professor Fox pointed out that 
increasing penalties alone will not solve the problem because 
the threat of punishment cannot deter youth that face violence 
every day, many of whom do not expect to live to adulthood.
    Judge Wohlford testified that automatically waiving violent 
juveniles into adult courts has not been proved successful. 
Professor Fox remarked about the unfortunate fact that ``we are 
obsessed with quick and easy solutions that will not work, such 
as the wholesale transfer of juveniles to the jurisdiction of 
the adult court, curfew laws, boot camps, three strikes, even 
caning and capital punishment, at the expense of long-term and 
difficult solutions that will work. * * *'' Professor Blumstein 
stressed that the bravado and peer pressure among the very 
young overwhelms the rational thought process necessary for 
harsh punishment to deter. Judge Kelly believes that locking up 
more and more juveniles without effective treatment will only 
produce ``bigger, more violent criminals,'' and that we should 
not treat youths the same as adults. The Committee agrees with 
Professor Blumstein that the demonstrably violent must be 
locked up. The Committee also agrees with Professor DiIulio 
that ``incarceration is not the answer. I also believe, 
however, that, like it or not, we will be incarcerating more 
juvenile offenders over the next 5 or 10 years. I believe that 
it is important for Federal policy to at least help with, or at 
least get out of the way of State and local efforts to 
incarcerate violent and repeat juvenile criminals, no ifs, ands 
or buts.'' However, the Committee accepts the judgement of Utah 
Commission Executive Director Camille Anthony that ``[t]here 
should not be a widening of the net by the federal government 
mandating to states which offenses should be waived, nor should 
there be any attempt by the federal government to identify an 
age at which waivers should occur. Those policy determinations 
are properly left with State legislatures.''
    Every witness told the Subcommittee that early intervention 
and prevention efforts are necessary. Professor Blumstein 
pointed out that because the societal institutions such as the 
family that provide socialization have declined, it is more 
important than ever that prevention be undertaken. Those 
efforts should begin earlier than has been tried before. Judge 
Kelly went to so far as to suggest that they begin from the 
moment of conception, but early on in any event. Judge Turner 
suggested targeting children who are now 5 to 10 years old, and 
an official with a local Big Brothers organization also 
stressed the importance of targeting the 6- to 10-year-old. 
There is a strong sense from juvenile judges and others that 
prevention is difficult after age 12 or thereabouts, or 
essentially the age when many young people enter the juvenile 
justice system. As Professor Fox testified, ``We must act now 
while this baby-boomerang generation is still young and 
impressionable, and will be impressed with what a teacher, a 
preacher, or some other authority figure has to say. If we wait 
until these children reach their teenage years, it may be too 
late to do much about it.''
    Early intervention efforts mean that large numbers of 
children must be reached. Although only a small percentage of 
youth will become the offenders that commit the vast majority 
of the crimes, it is impossible to identify such youth at the 
necessary age for intervention, Professor Fox testified. By the 
time the chronic offenders are identified through their 
actions, the likelihood of successful intervention is very low. 
Sadly, Judge Kelly testified, ``We have so many 8-, 9-, 10-
year-olds that are engaging in delinquent behavior, it is hard 
to figure out which one is the one that is going to end up 
killing somebody or doing something * * * like this. There are 
just so many children with guns at the age of 8, 9, 10 years 
old.''
    Witnesses had different ideas about what kinds of 
prevention programs are worthwhile. Professor DiIulio believes 
that the kinds of prevention programs that should be turned to 
involve churches. Professor Fox prefers school and recreation 
programs, job training, family support, and mentoring. 
Professor Blumstein believes that success can be obtained 
through providing day care to high school mothers to continue 
their education and socialize their children.
    The Committee has conflicting views about prevention 
programs aimed at strengthening families. The Committee agrees 
with Judge Deacon that working with a youth who is in the 
system, and then returning him to a poor home environment is 
``like washing a glove and immediately taking it and sticking 
it back in a bucket of tar.'' While the importance of families 
cannot be overemphasized, the Committee wonders about the cases 
in which ``families'' do not exist to be strengthened or 
preserved. Working with families that can be saved is 
important, in part because of the poor quality of foster care 
in so many places. But given the substance and child abuse 
present in so many homes, the Committee thinks that too often 
the effort is made to keep a ``family'' together when the 
better course is to take that cleaned up glove and put it in 
another bucket altogether. As Mayor Swiney stated, ``We've got 
to develop a system to enable authorities to remove children 
from hostile situations and violence in homes.'' Judge Wohlford 
thinks efforts to speed the process of terminating parental 
rights might be effective approaches to produce permanent 
placements. Professor Wolfgang has found that ``no clear 
evidence is available to prove'' that family preservation 
programs have ``long-term effects in reducing delinquency and 
violence.''
    The Committee believes that prevention is important, 
although not a substitute to taking strong action against 
today's violent young offenders. But it also believes that a 
very different type of Federal prevention effort should be 
undertaken than in the past, when the Federal Government 
dictated particular prevention programs with little or no basis 
for believing that they would be successful. As Mayor Speer 
stated, ``In general, efforts to address youth violence 
problems have failed.* * * We as a nation have historically 
thrown money at these types [of] problems, maybe in hopes that 
[they] would just go away.* * * [W]hat we are doing now is not 
working.'' The Committee hesitates to endorse any of these 
programs, for the reasons that follow in the discussion 
regarding research, although the Committee is encouraged by the 
results thus far of many private sector efforts to prevent 
youth violence, including the Boys and Girls Clubs and Big 
Brothers and Big Sisters.
    The Committee also recognizes that the problem of youth 
violence is severe and Americans rightly want immediate 
reductions in these crimes. However, the Committee also accepts 
Professor Fox's cautions that the impact of prevention is not 
manifested in actual crime reduction for 8 to 10 years when the 
target audience is currently 6 to 8, and patience will be 
required to see through some of the promising approaches.
    The Committee further realizes the political difficulty of 
taking long-term action to reduce the impact of the next wave 
of young people who are about to reach the age of committing 
serious crimes. The Committee chooses to retain the requirement 
that the formula grants be used at least 75 percent for 
prevention, although it broadens the definition of prevention 
and changes the use of the funds in relation to the mandates. 
As Professor Blumstein testified, the fact that benefits of 
prevention are so far in the future means that legislative 
bodies will tend to underfund these programs unless they are 
required to, even if they are effective. The Committee believes 
that political reality will work to encourage States to adopt 
the necessary actions to increase the punishment options for 
violent juveniles, such as longer sentences and secure 
facilities, as evidenced by the substantial number of state 
enactments to that effect, combined with changes in JJDPA that 
will avoid interference with such state policies.

             c. failures within the juvenile justice system

    Based on witness testimony, the Committee believes that the 
juvenile justice system has failed to effectively punish youth 
offenders. This is true notwithstanding the assistance the 
JJDPA was supposed to provide to juvenile courts. A key element 
of prevention the Committee believes should be encouraged is 
the imposition of graduated sanctions on persons who begin to 
come into contact with the juvenile justice system. The 
Committee finds that the juvenile justice system today fails to 
impose punishment in a definite and systematic way on too many 
offenders, with the result that too many offenders who might be 
able to be turned around before becoming violent criminals are 
left to continue on their criminal path.
    Judge Turner testified that 24 percent of juveniles in 
Tennessee had committed seven or more previous offenses. In 
Oklahoma, the average youth commits seven felonies before being 
placed in secure detention, and a similar situation exists in 
Virginia. One reason for this is that often nothing happens to 
juvenile offenders as a result of their appearance in juvenile 
court. The Committee is distressed that often nothing happens 
even if the youth commits a felony. Judge Kelly's young 
murderers were released to their (substance-abusing) parents 
numerous times after they built a long criminal history. The 
two had problems in school, constantly fought, and had numerous 
police contacts. The 10-year-old had been given probation for 
unlawful possession of a gun 9 days before he murdered the 5-
year-old, the first occasion in which he had any punishment 
imposed at all.
    The Committee is also concerned about the lack of space in 
which violent young people can be detained. Judge Camp 
testified that ``I can't get a kid in detention for anything 
less than drug dealing or weapons.'' Professor DiIulio recited 
that 9,000 juveniles were arrested for violent crime in 
Florida, but the State held only 1300 juveniles in custody. The 
Committee thinks Federal policies that interfere with States' 
ability to change this situation should themselves be changed.
    Judge Deacon believes that swift sanctioning and followup 
is an approach that can turn some early offenders away from a 
career in crime. There must be consequences. Professor Elliott 
testified in favor of imposing consequences of some kind for 
every arrest. As Chief Carson stated, ``[W]ith 98 percent of 
the children, you see a series of acts before he gets to the 
serious crime. If intervention comes early, we stand a better 
chance * * * of correcting the behavior.* * * Although it is 
true, as Judge Kelly points out, that many inner-city children 
could not possibly view time in a detention center where many 
of their friends already are placed as worse than the 
conditions of their home life, the Committee thinks Federal 
resources should be available, as part of prevention, to allow 
States to enable their juvenile justice systems to impose a 
consequence for every crime. On the whole, Oklahoma's Director 
Jerry Regier, a former OJJDP Administrator, properly notes that 
youth must be held accountable from their earliest signs of 
delinquency, and young people must know ``that when they 
violate the law * * * there will be a consequence to that 
violation.'' The Committee believes that in a time when 
millions of young people receive no discipline from their 
families, the need for graduated sanctions in juvenile court 
has never been greater.
    This does not mean that every offender must be locked up, 
and the requirement in the legislation that 75 percent of the 
formula grant be used for prevention purposes, including 
graduated sanctions, prevents the use of formula grants on 
incarceration. Graduated sanctions can be restitution, fines, 
or community service, for instance, or any other approach that 
will indicate that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated. 
If those sanctions are ineffective for particular individuals, 
then more severe penalties should be imposed after subsequent 
crimes. This approach also lets the system know earlier on who 
the more dangerous youth are, and can remove other offenders 
from the system altogether. The Committee is concerned, based 
on the testimony of young people, that after a young person is 
allowed to commit 10 or 20 offenses without consequence, there 
is little to stop the next offense. Moreover, if a youth 
receives no punishment until serious felonies are committed, 
then the only punishment he will ever receive is for a felony, 
whereas he might never have had to be incarcerated if the court 
had given him a less severe sentence for his earliest crime. 
Failure to impose graduated sanctions in this instance is not 
in the interest of the offender, the victim of the felony, or 
the society that has to pay the cost of secure detention.
    Virginia's Patricia West says that a graduated sanction 
should be ``something that the juvenile views as a tangible 
consequence that we as the system put on them and think is a 
consequence,'' and does not include probation. Rather, it must 
mean taking away something the juvenile enjoys, or requiring 
the juvenile to make an effort.
    Law enforcement approaches can essentially act as graduated 
sanctions as well. For instance, Professor Fox discussed a 
Massachusetts law requiring that a youth possessing a gun be 
incarcerated for 6 months no matter what. Had the 10-year-old 
in Chicago been subject to that law, the 5-year-old might be 
alive today, even if the former still never received any 
punishment until his gun possession arrest. Interestingly, the 
New York Times reports that Boston has had no juvenile murdered 
thus far in 1996 as of August, which the Committee finds to be 
remarkable, and the article suggests that this law may be one 
reason. Professor Blumstein mentioned New York's aggressive 
stop and frisk for gun approach, which punishes kids for 
possessing guns before a violent crime is committed. In 
Charleston, S.C., Chief Reuben Greenberg gives $100 for tips on 
illegal guns, which has the same effect, as well as reducing 
brandishing of weapons for fear of being prosecuted or 
arrested. Graduated sanctions for youth violence reflects no 
more than the knowledge from police techniques in adult crimes, 
which have found that punishing ``minor'' offenses produces 
major declines in more serious offenses. The Committee believes 
that prevention of youth violence can be achieved by applying 
this record to juvenile courts, and that JJDPA funds should be 
available to states who wish to pursue these approaches.

                            d. the mandates

    Under JJDPA, in addition to numerous administrative 
requirements, participating States are required to adhere to 
four core mandates. First, status offenders, youths who commit 
offenses that would not be crimes if committed by an adult, are 
not to be securely detained. Second, States are not to detain 
juveniles arrested for nonstatus offenses in adult lockups, 
except that in rural areas, such detention is permissible for 
24 hours if no acceptable alternative placement is available, 
with certain exceptions. Third, States are to separate juvenile 
offenders from incarcerated adults, and from part-time or full-
time security adult prisoner staff or direct-care staff, which 
OJJDP has interpreted to require sight and sound separation. 
Fourth, States are to ``address efforts to reduce the 
proportion of juveniles detained or confined in secure 
detention facilities, secure correctional facilities, jails, 
and lockups who are members of minority groups if such 
proportion exceeds the proportion such groups represent in the 
general population.''
    The Committee believes that each of the core mandates under 
JJDPA needs to be made more flexible. OJJDP has interpreted 
these mandates too stringently, with results that the Committee 
finds were never contemplated by the JJDPA. Further, it 
believes that many other requirements of the JJDPA that are 
imposed on the States should be eliminated. Moreover, the 
Committee finds that the mandates as currently written and 
interpreted interfere with the imposition of graduated 
sanctions, a result it concludes must change. The Committee 
also believes that JJDPA and OJJDP are directed too much to 
accomplishing the core mandates rather than focusing on 
effective punishment and prevention.
    While the main purpose of the mandates was to protect the 
physical safety of juvenile delinquents in jail, the regulatory 
interpretations of the mandates have unduly hindered the 
functioning of the juvenile justice system. As Barbara Holden 
of the Memphis and Shelby County Community Health Agency told 
the Subcommittee, ``[W]e have done what those strings required 
and I am not sure we have gotten the results and the outcomes 
that we desired and we need to learn from that experience.'' 
The Committee agrees with State legislators, State 
administrators of JJDPA funds, and Governor Sundquist that 
States must be given ``ongoing flexibility'' to meet the 
mandates, ``rather than having a Washington designer prescribe 
a one-size-fits-all model from afar.'' Representative Harwell 
testified, ``Frankly, federal mandates and large bureaucratic 
programs are not working in the local towns and cities across 
Tennessee,'' and the Committee believes this to be true in 
other States as well.
    A number of witnesses testified about the excessive filing 
requirements, including the representative of Big Brothers, who 
found Federal paperwork to be far more difficult to complete 
than funding requests from the State. Professor DiIulio stated 
that there are ``enormous numbers of regulatory weeds that 
strangle initiative, all kinds of bizarre paper-filing, 
imbecilic requirements.'' Mayor Swiney told the Subcommittee, 
``It's possible to administer a program completely out of its 
effectiveness,'' and that is what the Committee believes OJJDP 
has done with these mandates.
    The Committee also believes that the mandates have 
unnecessarily interfered with the effective and efficient 
operation of State juvenile justice systems in general, and 
juvenile correction facilities in particular. Professor 
Blumstein, who served on Pennsylvania's State advisory group 
for 11 years, testified that ``some of the mandates just got in 
the way of effective operation.'' Professor DiIulio described 
OJJDP as ``caught in something of an anti-incarceration time 
warp.'' The situation has become so intolerable that Utah's 
Camille Anthony related, ``State leaders throughout the country 
are questioning whether it is sound fiscal and public policy to 
continue to comply with the costly mandates of a 21-year-old 
juvenile justice act for a return of a relatively few federal 
dollars.'' Indeed, Wyoming has withdrawn from participating. 
Youth rights that lie behind the mandates may not be fully 
protected if States decide to pull out of JJDPA completely.
    The Committee is quite concerned that the 
deinstitutionalization of status offender mandate causes severe 
unintended negative consequences. As many witnesses told the 
Subcommittee, truancy, a classic status offense, is ``a gateway 
behavior leading to delinquency.'' Judge Turner put it well 
when he stated that ``while all truants are not delinquent, all 
delinquents have a history of truancy.'' The current mandate on 
status offenders makes imposing consequences for a behavior 
that is far more serious than it appears unnecessarily 
difficult.
    Judge Deacon testified that he has no place to put status 
offenders because of the mandates. If a runaway or truant is 
placed in nonsecure detention, ``they run back.'' Judge Camp 
noted poignantly, ``They go home and brag to everybody about 
how they beat the system and let you get away with whatever 
they want to get away with.'' Oklahoma's Jerry Regier told the 
Subcommittee, ``the mandates basically have hampered and 
restricted the ability to respond to the status offenders and 
the first-time offenders. We cannot sanction them 
effectively.'' The Committee finds this intolerable, and the 
opposite of how the juvenile justice system should operate.
    In addition, the status offender mandate often works 
against the interests of the offender. Virginia's Patricia West 
testified that these individuals sometimes need to be securely 
detained because of an unstable home setting, truancy 
enforcement, the need to assess the underlying reasons causing 
the running away, and the risk to themselves of incorrigible 
behavior. Additionally, the current status offender mandate is 
impractical in rural areas that lack alternate placements or 
that confront inebriated juveniles.
    The consequences of limiting options to deal with status 
offenders are serious. In Virginia, more than half of status 
offenders were rearrested within 3 years, and 85 percent of 
those were later charged with an offense more serious than a 
status offense. For these reasons, the Committee agrees that 
Senator Grassley is correct in criticizing an OJJDP staff 
comment that securely detaining runaways was a ``hideous 
thought.'' Although the current mandate provides for a valid 
court order exception, the Subcommittee heard testimony that in 
practice, no judge is likely to issue an order that can be 
second-guessed by an administrative official. Yet, many judges 
believe that incarcerating a status offender for a weekend, for 
instance, might be very effective in stopping further 
delinquent behavior. The practical effect of the mandate as it 
is currently administered is that status offenders cannot be 
securely detained. The Committee will not mandate that status 
offenders be detained, but it wants States that choose to do so 
to have some flexibility, while preserving the rights of these 
offenders.
    The Committee believes that the jail removal mandate is 
similarly interfering with the imposition of graduated 
sanctions and is in need of modification. Chief Carson told the 
Subcommittee that under the jail removal mandate, a police 
officer has to stay in the presence of the juvenile, because no 
place satisfying the mandate exists in a rural area to put the 
offender. As Sheriff Oedekoven and Chief Carson rightfully 
complained, if a community has only two or three police 
officers, that mandate ties up a substantial portion of the 
force for a time with little benefit, harming the entire 
community. As a result, ``you begin to find officers ignoring 
juvenile crime, as they often can, until it becomes a most 
serious matter.'' Once again, the Committee finds this to be 
the opposite of how the juvenile justice system should 
function. As Chief Carson said, ``By eliminating even short-
term secure detention, you have to remove the early 
intervention catalyst that brought together the forces that 
could provide earlier identification and assistance.'' Due to 
this mandate, juveniles learn what they can get away with 
without consequence. As Chief Carson stated, ``In many cases 
when responding to [a] call involving a juvenile, the offender 
will quote to the officer exactly what the officer can and 
cannot do, along with saying, `You can't lock me up' and `All 
I'll get is probation.' ''
    Wisconsin's Ray Luick believes that detention should be 
permissible in rural areas for up to 72 hours, which is not a 
major change from current law if the weekend and holiday 
exception is considered. Detention space that would satisfy 
OJJDP simply is not often available in rural areas. Oklahoma's 
Jerry Regier testified that some judges waive property 
offenders to adult court (in which case the mandate does not 
apply) because there is no detention space available, which 
results in a cure worse than the disease. Youths are 
transported long distances in many instances under the current 
law, only to then be returned a few days later. Virginia's 
Patricia West told the Subcommittee that the jail removal 
mandate in rural areas means that the youth, if detained, is 
confined outside the community. Given the hassles, many 
departments choose not to arrest juveniles, which sends the 
wrong message. Mr. Luick testified that Wisconsin has both a 
high juvenile arrest rate and a low juvenile crime rate. The 
Committee believes that this is not a coincidence. Chief Carson 
testified that a 72-hour exception to the jail removal mandate 
would make police more willing to ``make the arrest, make the 
citation, and get the system started for the juvenile now 
before it gets too serious.'' The Committee wishes to change 
the law so that States will not face incentives not to arrest.
    The Committee also heard testimony that the separation 
mandate should be changed. Clearly, the Committee agrees with 
Colorado's William Woodward that having adults in close 
proximity to youth can increase the risk of violence to 
juveniles, the risk of suicide, and potential liability to law 
enforcement officials, as well as exposing juveniles to a 
dangerously influential criminal element. Nonetheless, Sheriff 
Oedekoven testified that under OJJDP regulations, this mandate 
prohibits even haphazard contacts between adults and juveniles. 
Separate staff must be maintained, so that ``an officer 
stationed in a guard tower cannot flip a switch to open a cell 
block door for an adult inmate during the same shift in which 
he opened a door for a juvenile.'' He stated that ``Congress 
should re-examine the role of the OJJDP and reign [sic] in 
their rulemaking authority.'' Virginia's Patricia West 
testified how difficult it is to avoid even haphazard contact, 
and stated that the most serious harm likely occurs only if 
juveniles are actually housed with adult offenders.
    OJJDP also ordinarily interprets the sight and sound 
separation mandate to preclude collocated facilities. 
Wisconsin's Ray Luick testified that such facilities permit the 
shared use of educational and recreational facilities that 
otherwise would not be available to juveniles, and he 
recommended that the JJDPA be modified to permit shared staff 
and collocated facilities.
    The Subcommittee also heard testimony that the 
disproportionate minority confinement mandate should be 
changed. Utah's Camille Anthony stated that this mandate ``is 
inappropriately placed on the juvenile justice system.'' She 
believes that ``states cannot comply with it in its present 
form.'' Oklahoma's Jerry Regier testified that youths are 
arrested for their acts, rather than their race. He suggested 
that the answer to the problem of disproportionate minority 
confinement is ``to ensure prevention monies get to the right 
neighborhoods and families so we can actually reduce the 
percentage of African-Americans coming into the system.'' Such 
an approach is consistent with the ABA's Robert Schwartz, who 
states that under this mandate in Pennsylvania, ``state and 
local partnerships have used formula grants to introduce 
intensive prevention programs in high-crime areas with large 
minority populations.''
    Under current law, States are penalized for noncompliance 
with the mandates. Judge Turner testified that OJJDP should not 
penalize States with a loss of 25 percent of their funding for 
each mandate not complied with. And Virginia's Patricia West 
stated that this penalty, combined with the requirement that 
the remainder of the formula grant allocation be used to comply 
with any mandate a state does not satisfy is ``unnecessarily 
punitive.'' She indicated that States may want to fund 
multiyear pilot prevention programs, and funding for these 
programs may be cut off in midstream, no matter how effective 
the program, if the State temporarily is out of compliance with 
a mandate. In any event, the GAO's Laurie Ekstrand found that 
OJJDP conducts little monitoring for compliance with the 
mandates. GAO found that OJJDP conducted 29 such on-site 
monitoring visits in the three years 1993-95, rather than the 
171 that would have been conducted if OJJDP had adhered to its 
policy of annual visits for each State.
    Finally, States are currently required as a condition of 
receiving JJDPA funds to set up a State Advisory Group, and the 
statute prescribes many conditions a State must satisfy in 
setting up the advisory group. In addition, the State must 
spend a certain portion of its JJDPA allocation on the advisory 
group. Utah's Camille Anthony testified that these requirements 
were burdensome. She believes that many States receive little 
of value from these advisory groups. She also found that some 
of the membership requirements were impractical, such as 
including young people who may be in school and have difficulty 
in obtaining transportation to the meetings. In lieu of State 
advisory groups, she suggested that Congress ``allow States to 
determine the appropriate mechanism by which these funds should 
be distributed and the board that makes that decision. * * *''

               e. research, evaluation, and dissemination

    OJJDP was established in large part to be the Federal 
Government's research arm into juvenile delinquency and to be a 
resource to States on effective programs and techniques to 
address the problem. This meant that OJJDP would undertake its 
own research and evaluation efforts but that it would also 
disseminate to the States the results of well-considered 
evaluation and research studies performed by others. Given the 
juvenile delinquency problem of the time, Congress was 
farsighted in the creation of this function. Unfortunately, the 
Committee believes that OJJDP has failed to fulfill the promise 
of determining effective programs. Indeed, the Committee 
believes that we know little more of what is effective today 
than we knew two decades ago, putting to one side how to 
address the very different youth violence problem that exists 
today. At the Subcommittee's oversight hearing, for instance, 
witnesses were able to identify only a few OJJDP-funded 
programs that had been evaluated to be effective. This was true 
notwithstanding OJJDP's publication of a list of programs 
purported to be effective, only a small number of which had 
ever been evaluated.
    The Committee believes that it is an urgent priority that 
the research and evaluation mission that was intended for OJJDP 
22 years ago actually be performed. Everyone knows that youth 
violence is a serious national problem, but little is known 
about successfully preventing those crimes or intervening to 
make young criminals turn away from their offending. Professor 
Blumstein testified that existing research findings ``reflect 
only a tiny portion of what we need to know to make effective 
policy and operational decisions'' and that we are ``at an 
extremely primitive stage of knowledge regarding violence.'' 
One major deficit in the existing research is its frequent 
focus on one site or setting, rather than a determination of 
whether a particular approach can be generalized to a larger 
population base, he indicated. Professor Blumstein told the 
Subcommittee that while some work has been done to determine 
the effectiveness of intervention programs, little research 
into effective prevention is available because of the lengthy 
time periods required to measure the effectiveness of 
prevention programs.
    Numerous witnesses concurred that the primary 
responsibility for the operation and effectiveness of the 
juvenile justice system lies with State and local governments. 
Nonetheless, a consensus among witnesses developed that 
conducting research and evaluation of programs designed to 
combat youth violence is a proper Federal function. Professor 
Blumstein concluded that States are unlikely to focus on such a 
public good when its benefits would be dispersed so widely. 
Even if States did conduct such research, the results would not 
reflect the effectiveness of a program upon a broad range of 
populations, which is a critical research need. Further, only 
the Federal Government is likely to conduct such comprehensive 
research due to its cost, although economies of scale would be 
available at the Federal level.
    To be sure, OJJDP currently conducts research, and some of 
the witnesses praised some of its research. Nonetheless, OJJDP 
emphasizes how much of its resources are returned directly to 
the States, implicitly recognizing that little of its budget is 
directed to research and evaluation. And the quality of much of 
its research work is subject to criticism. Dean Schwartz, a 
former OJJDP Administrator, remarked that ``OJJDP still does 
not have a focus and coherent research and development agenda. 
Because of this, resources have been squandered and little 
knowledge has been advanced in key areas.''
    Witnesses agreed not only that the quality of Federal 
research must be improved, but that the budget for such 
research must be increased as well. Professor Blumstein 
contrasted the OJJDP youth violence research budget of under 
$20 million with NIH's budget, which is nearly 1000 times 
larger. ``It is clear that the research expenditures in this 
area are profoundly inconsistent with the magnitude of the 
problem, with the resources being expended to address the 
problem, and with the resources committed to other comparably 
important National issues.''
    Witnesses appearing before the Subcommittee raised urgent 
and serious issues in youth violence in research that would be 
appropriate subjects for Federal research efforts. Professor 
Blumstein discussed the paucity of information concerning the 
development of violent career criminals and how that 
development relates to family environments. Dean Schwartz 
agreed that little is known concerning the prevention of 
serious chronic and violent behavior. Professor Blumstein also 
listed as necessary research issues the effect of community 
conditions such as social isolation on juvenile violence, gang 
violence, drug markets, and gun markets. Additionally, research 
is needed into what intervention programs successfully 
socialize offenders, and how the juvenile justice system can 
control illegal guns and drugs. Dean Schwartz finds that 
research is needed into the effectiveness of applying adult 
sentencing practices on juveniles and in identifying effective 
programs, with reference to particular types of youth in 
particular circumstances. He also thinks the relationship of 
substance abuse to youth crime needs further study.
    In addition to directing research into basic questions such 
as criminal history progression and the effects of trying 
youths as adults, witnesses such as Professors Thornberry and 
Elliott agreed that rigorous evaluation research should be 
conducted on various prevention programs to determine if such 
programs are effective. Professor Elliott believes that too 
much of what OJJDP spends on evaluation does not actually 
determine the effectiveness of programs, but only whether a 
program delivers the services that it said in its grant 
application that it would provide. The GAO's Laurie Ekstrand 
found that the evaluations OJJDP conducted for its 
discretionary grants were of exactly that process-oriented 
character. Too often, recipients of Federal prevention grants 
make well-meaning but unsubstantiated claims that their 
programs are successful. The Committee agrees with Professor 
Wolfgang that self-congratulatory anecdotal claims of success 
should be discounted.
    Peer-reviewed evaluations are the only means of determining 
which prevention programs actually are worth funding. To study 
effectiveness, individual programs need to be tested in 
different locations with different youths and different staffs 
for a lengthy time period. Such evaluation is expensive. 
Professor Elliott told the Subcommittee that ``the evaluations 
we are talking about here cost as much as the annual budget for 
most of these programs.'' Yet, less comprehensive evaluations 
will produce little new knowledge of successful approaches to 
reduce what is perhaps the country's most significant problem.
    Witnesses such as Professors Thornberry and Elliott agreed 
that if JJDPA were turned into a block grant program, no such 
comprehensive evaluations would occur. States would spend the 
money without having any base of knowledge whether the money 
was spent on effective programs. They thought that scenario 
should be avoided.
    Of course, not all research will produce evidence of 
successful approaches. However, as Professor Thornberry noted, 
identifying programs that do not work is as important as 
identifying successful programs. Indeed, some research in this 
area has identified programs that are not only not effective, 
but are actually harmful. States need to know which programs 
their formula grants should not support.
    To do so, Dean Schwartz and Professor Wolfgang maintain 
that OJJDP needs to do a better job in disseminating to the 
States the result of research and evaluation efforts. Dean 
Schwartz mentioned that OJJDP should provide the States with 
more policy-relevant information, such as the studies that 
suggest that juveniles who go to adult prison are more likely 
to commit crimes upon their release than similarly situated 
juveniles who are sent to juvenile facilities. Once effective 
programs are identified, Professors Elliott and Wolfgang 
suggested that States be given incentives to implement 
successful programs and not to fund unsuccessful ones.
    Professors Blumstein and Elliott also stressed the 
importance of the Federal Government's provision of training 
and technical assistance to the States, once it has been 
determined that there are effective techniques and evaluations 
that have been carried out. Professor Elliott mentioned that 
OJJDP now has 8 grants for data collection, and funds 24 
agencies for technical assistance, which should be better 
coordinated.
    The call at the hearings for additional research was not 
made by academics alone. Colonel Gordon indicated that no one 
knows whether various programs are effective, and thought that 
``the best thing the Federal Government could do is provide 
research for that effort. * * *'' Judge Deacon described the 
Federal Government's providing of research and training as 
``one of the real critical needs.'' A Tennessee youth detention 
center administrator agreed. And Utah's Camille Anthony 
indicated that if JJDPA is to be reauthorized, OJJDP ``should 
concentrate on assisting States with the development of 
effective prevention programs.''

                        f. discretionary grants

    In addition to providing formula grants, enforcing the 
mandates, conducting research, and providing technical 
assistance and disseminating information to the States, OJJDP 
currently administers discretionary grants. The Committee 
believes that these discretionary grants are in need of major 
restructuring. It agrees with Tennessee's Barbara Holden that 
too much Federal antidelinquency spending results from 
``design[ing] programs and t[ying] government dollars to 
problems which are the most pressing at that time. It seems to 
make little difference that these programs repeatedly fail to 
make the gains that we hope to accomplish through them.''
    Because OJJDP's research and evaluation efforts have been 
unsatisfactory over the years, OJJDP today funds tens of 
millions of dollars of discretionary grants without any 
assurance that those funds will reduce youth violence. Current 
law makes States agree to fund federally designed projects in 
order to qualify for Federal funds, whether these projects are 
the State's primary youth violence problem or whether the 
program will make a positive difference. The Committee firmly 
believes that the Federal Government, including the Congress, 
needs to cease its current mindset that simply creating and 
funding a Federal youth violence program equates with 
ameliorating the problem.
    Too much of OJJDP's current practices involve funding and 
administering without regard to whether its actions lead to 
effective punishment or prevention. Not only does its myopic 
interpretation of the mandates cause unnecessary expense for 
States without results, but too many of its discretionary 
grants are designed to further extend the reach of the mandates 
seemingly for their own sake. Dean Schwartz encouraged the 
Congress to turn JJDPA's attention away from the mandates and 
use OJJDP's discretionary funds for more pressing juvenile 
crime control and prevention issues.
    Even more serious, too much of OJJDP's discretionary grants 
are used for programs that are not known to be effective, and 
that may even be detrimental. For instance, JJDPA funds a 
discretionary grant program for mentoring. Yet, according to 
Professor Wolfgang, ``the majority of these mentoring programs 
do not work.'' Professor DiIulio is on the board of Public-
Private Ventures, which conducted a study showing the 
effectiveness of the Big Brother/Big Sisters program. However, 
that evaluation focused on the specific differences in that 
program that distinguished it from other mentoring programs. In 
fact, the Committee is aware of evaluations of certain 
mentoring programs that increased juvenile crime by exposing 
youth to mentors who were negative influences, compared with a 
control group.
    Similarly, OJJDP administers a discretionary grant program 
under JJDPA that supposedly combats gang activity. Professor 
Wolfgang has studied the evaluation literature of gang 
education programs designed to prevent young people from 
joining gangs, as well as other programs designed to work with 
existing gang members. He told the Subcommittee that 
evaluations of gang education programs showed only that they 
had changed attitudes, but that programs like Gang Resistance 
and Education Training [GREAT] ``had virtually zero impact'' in 
actually reducing gang membership. Programs that worked with 
gang members did not reduce gang membership or gang-related 
crime. In certain instances, he related, ``negative effects 
such as increased delinquency were observed.'' Professor 
Elliott noted that the Government is funding ineffective 
programs and ``[i]t doesn't seem to bother us. We have got very 
popular programs going on right now * * * that we have at least 
fairly good evidence aren't working that we are still spending 
money on.'' The Committee strongly concludes that JJDPA and 
OJJDP should not fund programs labelled as ``anti-gang'' or 
``mentoring'' programs that at best are a waste of money and at 
worst actually increase delinquency.
    The problem is growing. GAO found that OJJDP has funded 162 
new discretionary grants in recent years. Without knowing the 
effectiveness of these programs, it seems that OJJDP's current 
uses of discretionary funds to treat juvenile delinquency can 
be compared to the use of bleeding to treat disease two 
centuries ago.
    The Committee believes that this is the greatest current 
problem in Federal crime prevention funding. A recent GAO 
report found that the Government funds 131 programs designed to 
prevent youth crime at a cost of $4 billion. GAO found that 
substantial duplication may exist in the types of programs and 
the target population. So many programs exist that even top 
OJJDP staff, the agency that by statute is supposed to 
coordinate the Federal Government's delinquency prevention 
effort, understandably did not know of the existence of some of 
the programs. Moreover, these programs have been designed and 
funded with strict Federal rules that are not required to 
guarantee effectiveness, but because someone arbitrarily 
decided they should exist. In addition, Professors Elliott and 
Wolfgang told the Subcommittee that many of these 131 Federal 
antidelinquency programs are ``involved in things that we have 
got pretty good evidence aren't effective.''
    Fixing this overall problem is beyond the scope of 
reauthorizing the JJDPA. Nonetheless, the Committee believes 
that the Federal Government has made a serious mistake in its 
juvenile crime policy. It has mandated that States spend money 
for particular programs without having any idea whether these 
programs are effective. In the next Congress, committees with 
oversight jurisdiction should examine whether federally funded 
antidelinquency programs are duplicative and effective. The 
Committee believes that it is appropriate for Federal resources 
to fund effective crime prevention, not necessarily any social 
spending labelled as such. Because of the lack of knowledge and 
the Federal Government's poor track record in this area, the 
Committee hesitates to spell out specific crime prevention 
programs for States to implement or specific crime prevention 
programs that should receive funding from discretionary grants.
    The Committee found that OJJDP's discretionary grants are 
used in other ways that are unrelated to effective crime 
prevention. For instance, Dean Schwartz explained, too much of 
OJJDP's discretionary funds are tied up in earmarks and set-
asides to organizations that, while worthy and important, were 
not intended to be the beneficiary of OJJDP's limited 
discretionary funds. Congress has written into the statute an 
earmark for the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court 
Judges, for instance. As Dean Schwartz told the Subcommittee 
and Professor Elliott concurred, ``[I]f just $20 million of the 
$40 million that went to the National Council of Juvenile and 
Family Court Judges might have been targeted for critical 
research trying to address the prevention issue for chronic 
delinquents or preventing serious violent behavior, we might 
not be in this position that we are in today. You can make a 
very good argument that judicial training ought to be a state 
and local responsibility. * * *''
    Moreover, he suggests that discretionary grants be freed 
up, and the money used to fund a set of prioritized national 
issues in research in the field. He also advocates that the 
discretionary funds be awarded competitively. The Committee 
agrees.
    A further problem concerning OJJDP's discretionary grants 
brought to the Committee's attention is their direction to 
programs that are not innovative. Professor Elliott remarked 
that the creative programs in this area that have been funded 
over the past 10 years have not come out of OJJDP. In fact, a 
number of academics have told the Subcommittee that one large 
discretionary grant program is based on knowledge that is far 
from innovative and has essentially created a cottage industry 
for the provision of technical assistance to grant recipients.
    Dean Schwartz testified, ``[O]ver the years there has been 
a steady decline in the stature, influence, and respect of the 
OJJDP. The Office is not reviewed [sic] as a credible resource 
to elected public officials and juvenile justice professionals. 
* * *'' The Committee reluctantly concludes that OJJDP's 
difficulties with rigidly enforcing an impractical 
interpretation of the mandates, its failure to conduct quality 
evaluation and disseminate useful information to the States, 
its funding of discretionary grants of dubious value, and the 
pressing need for more research and evaluation into effective 
approaches to preventing and controlling youth violence, 
require a restructuring of the Office.
    The Committee views S. 1952 as making the changes in the 
reauthorization of JJDPA that were recommended by the witnesses 
who appeared, witnesses who reflected expertise in criminology 
as well as vast experience with the practical administration of 
existing statutory provisions. The Committee does not consider 
S. 1952 to be a panacea for the very serious youth violence 
problem now facing the country. It does, however, believe that 
S. 1952 establishes a useful role for the Federal Government to 
assist States and localities to carry out their 
responsibilities to prevent, prosecute, and punish youth 
violence.

                       IV. Vote of the Committee

    On August 1, 1996, with a quorum present, the Senate 
Committee on the Judiciary by voice vote ordered S. 1952 
favorably reported.

                     V. Section-by-Section Analysis

                         SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE

    This section sets forth the short title of the legislation, 
``The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 
1996.''

                         SECTION 101. FINDINGS

    This section rewrites the findings of the current 
legislation. Youth violence figures are updated. The findings 
reflect that younger persons are committing violent acts and 
that if current trends continue, given the increase in the 
youth population over the next several years, youth violence 
will dramatically increase unless effective prevention and 
control strategies are adopted. This section also finds that 
illegitimacy, the decline of marriage, welfare dependence, and 
youth violence are closely interrelated, as are child abuse and 
neglect and youth violence. Further, the section adds findings 
that increased drug abuse has led to increases in child abuse 
and youth violence, and that child welfare agencies fail to 
break the cycle between abuse and delinquency. Additionally, 
this section finds that the juvenile justice system fails to 
protect the public from violent youths, particularly because it 
fails to impose certain and graduated punishments. This section 
also finds that existing Federal programs have not provided the 
research and evaluation necessary to determine which programs 
are effective in preventing youth violence. Further, the 
section finds that current mandates in the legislation have 
been administered too inflexibly, and have made the Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency prevention too focused on 
issues unrelated to preventing or punishing youth violence. 
This section eliminates findings in current law concerning 
services to juveniles, Federal leadership, rehabilitation, and 
public recreation and self-esteem.

                         SECTION 102. PURPOSES

    This section adds new purposes to the Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention Act. The section adds that scientific 
evaluation into effective means of preventing youth violence is 
now a purpose of the legislation, as is assisting the States in 
punishing and controlling youth offenders. Purposes in existing 
law to develop national standards, strengthening families, and 
removing youths from local jails are eliminated.

      SECTION 103. JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION ACT

    This section makes changes to title II of the Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. This section amends 
section 201 of JJDPA by changing the name of the Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to the Office of 
Youth Violence Reduction. The Administrator of the office would 
no longer be a Presidential appointee, but rather a career 
appointee who has experience in juvenile justice programs. The 
Administrator has the authority to prescribe regulations 
consistent with the Act to award, administer, modify, extend, 
terminate, monitor, evaluate, reject, or deny all grants and 
contracts from, and applications for, funds made available 
under this title.
    This section also amends section 204 of JJDPA to require 
the Administrator to submit his plan for Federal juvenile 
delinquency prevention programs to the Congress, rather than 
the current requirement of consulting with the Coordinating 
Council of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. In 
addition, the Administrator is given the role of reducing 
duplication among Federal juvenile delinquency programs and 
activities conducted by Federal departments and agencies. In 
submitting his plan to the Congress, the Administrator should 
inform Congress which Federal programs appear duplicative, and 
which programs appear to be ineffective based on evaluations 
conducted by the Federal Government or nonprofit entities. Most 
of the Administrator's current responsibilities set forth in 
section 204 are eliminated.
    This section strikes section 206, the Coordinating Council 
on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Committee 
believes that the Council meets infrequently, despite prior 
congressional attempts to increase its activity. The Committee 
also believes that the Council does not effectively coordinate 
Federal antidelinquency programs, as evidenced by a recent 
report of the U.S. General Accounting Office.
    This section also strikes portions of current section 207 
of JJDPA, now redesignated section 206, that refer to the 
Council. It also eliminates the requirement that the 
Administrator report on State compliance with State plans under 
JJDPA. Additionally, the section requires the Administrator to 
report on scientifically evaluated and demonstrated effective 
delinquency prevention programs. The Committee finds that the 
current law's requirement that the Administrator identify 
``exemplary'' prevention programs serves no useful purpose if 
those programs have not been scientifically determined to be 
effective.
    This section amends section 221 of JJDPA by eliminating the 
Administrator's authority to evaluate programs and to issue 
grants to implement State plans. Evaluation functions under 
JJDPA will now be under the exclusive domain of the National 
Institute for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. This 
section also eliminates the requirement in section 221 of JJDPA 
that recipients of technical assistance coordinate their 
activities with State advisory groups.
    This section amends section 222 of JJDPA by eliminating 
references to parts D and E of JJDPA. Additionally, references 
to earlier fiscal years are changed to authorize appropriations 
for the next 4 fiscal years. Further, the section removes the 
requirement in section 222(d) of JJDPA that 5 percent of the 
minimum annual allocation to any State be made available to 
assist the State advisory group.
    This section substitutes new language for section 223 of 
JJDPA. States would no longer be required to submit 3-year 
State plans to the Administrator and demonstrate progress in 
implementing those plans. States would also no longer be 
required to establish State advisory groups. States would be 
permitted to establish State advisory groups, and if they 
choose to do so, may choose to adhere to all, some, or none of 
the requirements for those groups now contained in section 223 
of JJDPA. This section also eliminates the current requirements 
in section 223 of JJDPA that State plans contain various 
analyses, distribute funds in various ways, provide for certain 
rights protections, and establish various other plans.
    This section provides that for States to be eligible to 
receive formula grants, they must spend at least 75 percent of 
the formula grants for preventive and nonincarcerative 
intervention, including drug and alcohol treatment activities, 
and programs that encourage courts to develop and implement a 
continuum of post-adjudication restraints that bridge the gap 
between probation and confinement in a correctional facility, 
including graduated sanctions for youth offenders, and for 
implementing a system whereby every offender receives some 
sanction for every crime, except that such funds cannot be used 
for purposes that the National Institute for Juvenile Justice 
and Delinquency Prevention determines do not prevent or reduce 
youth violence. To comply with this requirement, States may 
spend funds to become able to impose various graduated 
sanctions, but that term does not include correctional 
facilities, although States may use the other 25 percent of the 
formula grants for these purposes. Present law imposes a 75-
percent requirement for spending on a narrower range of program 
options. Since the imposition of punishment in additional cases 
may constitutionally require that more youth receive access to 
counsel, States may use funds for graduated sanctions for this 
purpose. This section permits States to use funds for any 
preventive purpose that NIJJDP determines not to be 
ineffective. For this reason, this section eliminates the long 
list of activities that under current law satisfy this 
requirement of section 223, since many of these may not be 
effective in preventing youth violence or imposing graduated 
punishments or some sanction for every crime.
    This section also requires that States provide for the 
keeping of records by recipients of formula grants so that 
NIJJDP can monitor whether the use of the funds has prevented 
or reduced youth violence.
    This section requires that States, as a condition for 
receipt of formula grants, ensure that juveniles who are 
charged with or who have committed offenses that would not be 
criminal if committed by an adult (other than an offense that 
constitutes a violation of a valid court order or a violation 
of section 922(x) of title 18, United States Code, or a similar 
State law), or alien juveniles in custody, or such nonoffenders 
as dependent or neglected children, shall not be placed in 
secure detention or secure correctional facilities, except that 
the juvenile or family court may detain, after a hearing, in a 
secure detention facility for a limited time not to exceed 72 
hours, a runaway, truant, or incorrigible youth, if the youth 
either (1) received a previous official court warning that an 
additional instance of such behavior would result in the secure 
detention of that youth or (2) the chronic behavior of the 
youth constitutes a clear and present danger to the physical or 
emotional well-being of the youth or the physical safety of the 
community, if the juvenile's detention is not longer than the 
time necessary to eliminate such danger and secure detention is 
the least restrictive means available for guarding the safety 
of the youth or the community. Under existing section 223 of 
JJDPA, status offenders as a practical matter cannot be 
securely detained. This section would allow, but would not 
mandate, that States could securely detain chronic status 
offenders for up to 72 hours if they had received a prior 
judicial warning that such result would follow continued 
commission of status offenses. States are encouraged to provide 
assistance to such youth during this period. In addition, 
States could, but would not be forced to, securely detain 
status offenders whose chronic behavior poses a threat to their 
own safety or public safety, as might be the case for chronic 
runaways who are found at late hours living on the street.
    This section also establishes a condition for State receipt 
of formula grants that an annual report be submitted to the 
Administrator describing compliance with section 223 of JJDPA 
and containing a review of the progress in deinstitutionalizing 
status offenders under the revised section 223. This is 
necessary so that the Administrator can determine if the State 
is complying with the statutory conditions for receipt of 
formula grants.
    This section amends the separation mandate by prohibiting 
only the regular contact of adults and juveniles. This section 
amends the requirement that direct-care and management staff 
cannot be shared to permit such sharing if the staff has been 
properly trained and certified by the State to deal with 
juvenile offenders, and staff is not dealing directly with both 
adult and juvenile prisoners in the same shift. ``Regular 
contact'' means that youth may not be in sight or sound contact 
with adults when in residential confinement, but that 
incidental contact in common areas is permissible if reasonable 
efforts, such as curtains and blackened windows, are used to 
separate adult and juvenile offenders, including in spaces for 
processing accused offenders. This section also permits the use 
of collocated facilities if such steps are taken. Staff that 
has no role in direct care or management of youth offenders, 
such as cooks, may be shared in the same shift. In addition, 
direct-care and management staff may be shared between youths 
and adults so long as the State has provided training and 
certification on dealing with juvenile offenders, and such 
staff does not deal directly with both adults and juveniles in 
the same shift. No specific form of good-faith training and 
certification is required.
    This section amends the jail removal mandate of section 223 
of JJDPA. States could receive formula grants while permitting 
the detention or confinement of juveniles in a State-approved 
operation of a county jail or secure detention facility for up 
to 72 hours if there is compliance with the separation mandate 
as revised and the facility is located outside a metropolitan 
area where no existing acceptable alternative placement is 
easily accessible, rather than the current standard of 
``availability.'' This section eliminates exceptions to the 
current jail removal standard that are no longer necessary as a 
result of the amended language.
    This section amends the disproportionate minority 
confinement mandate contained in section 223 of JJDPA. The new 
standard requires only that States address prevention efforts 
to reduce the proportion of minority group members who are 
securely detained if such proportion exceeds the group's 
proportion in the general population, and that they adhere to 
the requirement codified at section 3789d(b) of 42 U.S.C. This 
change addresses the concern that the existing language of this 
mandate, reasonably can be read to have unintentionally 
required that quotas be imposed on the locking up of 
individuals based on their race rather than their conduct. To 
comply with the new language, States would have to ensure that 
at least some of their prevention money was spent in areas 
where minority groups were concentrated if those groups were 
being securely detained in proportions greater than their 
proportion of the general population. Supporters of the current 
language of this mandate testified that that was their 
understanding of existing law.
    This section changes the penalty provisions of existing 
section 223 for failing to comply with various mandates. If a 
State fails to comply with any one of the following mandates: 
status offenders, separation, jail removal, or minority 
overrepresentation, the Administrator shall reduce the State's 
formula grant allocation by 25 percent. States could continue 
to spend the remainder of their formula grant on the purposes 
permitted under section 223, and would not need to use those 
funds to come into compliance with that mandate. If a State 
failed to comply with more than one of those four mandates, 
then it would lose 50 percent of its formula grant funding, and 
could use the remaining 50 percent for the crime prevention 
activities permitted under section 223. States could thus 
receive 50 percent of their formula grant amounts even if they 
complied with none of these four mandates. This section 
prohibits the imposition of penalties on States that fail to 
comply with the mandates of section 223 if those States have 
enacted legislation conforming to those requirements that 
contains enforcement mechanisms sufficient to ensure that such 
legislation is enforced effectively. OJJDP can determine 
whether there is effective enforcement either because the State 
law in fact results in near total compliance with the mandates 
or because available administrative or judicial remedies 
effectively enforce State laws that adopt the same standards as 
contained in section 223.
    This section also amends section 241 of JJDPA to move the 
National Institute of Juvenile Justice out of the Office of 
Youth Violence Reduction and into the Office of Justice 
Programs. The head of NIJJDP will be denominated the Director 
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, a position that 
shall be filled through Presidential appointment with the 
advice and consent of the Senate from among individuals who 
have had experience in juvenile justice programs or experience 
in scientific research. The required experience in scientific 
research need not be in the field of juvenile justice. This 
section adds as purposes of NIJJDP to provide for the rigorous 
and independent evaluation of the delinquency and youth 
violence prevention programs funded by the formula grants and 
to provide funding for research and demonstration projects on 
the nature, causes, and prevention of youth violence and 
juvenile delinquency. The purpose of these changes is to make 
sure that the programs formulated under the formula grants can 
be scientifically and independently evaluated to determine 
their effectiveness. The statute does not provide sufficient 
funds to result in the evaluation of all formula grant funded 
programs, but the Director should evaluate a mix of programs in 
a variety of locales among a diverse group of youth so that 
knowledge can be gained about the evaluation of types of 
programs as well as individual approaches. This section removes 
the Director's role with the State advisory groups, including 
the provision of technical assistance. This section also 
directs NIJJDP to make grants and enter into contacts to 
evaluate programs funded by State formula grants as well as to 
evaluate the projects it funds itself, and to fund research 
projects. This section requires that these evaluations and 
research studies be independent, awarded competitively, and 
employ rigorous and scientifically recognized standards and 
methodologies, including peer review by nonapplicants. The 
Committee's desire is to enhance the professionalism and 
quality of work product conducted by NIJJDP, with NIH, NSF, and 
similar Federal research agencies as models.
    This section amends section 243 of JJDPA by eliminating 
references to programs that strengthen and preserve families, 
due to the questionable nature of such programs as a matter of 
policy and effectiveness. This section also directs that the 
technical assistance provided by NIJJDP be of the best 
practices, instead of simply providing technical assistance as 
under current section 244 of JJDPA. Rather than encouraging the 
development of programs to take into account life experiences 
of offenders, this section directs NIJJDP to develop, through 
research and evaluation, studies concerning effective methods 
for preventing and intervening in juvenile delinquency, 
including studies of the effectiveness of waiving juveniles 
into adult court and risk prediction, with particular reference 
to the circumstances of the youth and staff involved that make 
a particular program successful or unsuccessful. Further issues 
for research by NIJJDP are identified in the discussion portion 
of this report and through section 301 of the legislation. This 
section also directs NIJJDP to disseminate the results of what 
NIJJDP learns about effective programs and research into youth 
crime and other data collection. NIJJDP is also to disseminate 
regular reports on the record of each State in combatting youth 
violence, such as the number, rate, and trend of homicides and 
other serious crimes committed by youths. In this way, States 
can be held accountable for whether they are using crime 
prevention funds wisely, and States can learn which States are 
operating programs that might be effective for use in their own 
States. Provisions in this section concerning NIJJDP's 
authority to undertake studies into subjects covered by the 
mandates in section 223 of JJDPA are eliminated.
    This section strikes section 244 of JJDPA concerning 
technical assistance, section 245 on training programs, 246 on 
curriculum for training programs, 247 relating to participating 
in training programs and State advisory group conferences, and 
248 on special studies and reports. NIJJDP is authorized 
instead to provide the best practices for technical assistance, 
primarily by informing States of what methods and programs have 
been scientifically demonstrated to be effective.
    This section also strikes section 261 of JJDPA, special 
emphasis prevention and treatment programs. The programs 
currently listed in this section either concern the mandates 
and are thus unrelated to punishing or preventing youth 
violence, can be funded by State formula grants if States so 
choose, or have not been demonstrated to be effective in 
preventing youth violence.
    This section also redesignates present section 262 of JJDPA 
as section 244, and adds factors the Director must consider in 
determining whether or not to approve applications for grants 
and contracts for research and evaluation that are designed to 
improve the scientific validity of the research conducted. 
These include whether the project uses appropriate and rigorous 
methodology, including appropriate samples, control groups, 
psychometrically sound measurement, and appropriate data 
analysis techniques, the experience of the principal and 
coprincipal investigators in the area of youth violence and 
juvenile delinquency, the protection offered human subjects in 
the study, including informed consent procedures, and the cost 
effectiveness of the proposed project. Quality of the research 
is further enhanced by this section's requirement that NIJJDP 
select grant and contract recipients only after a competitive 
process that provides potential applicants with at least 90 
days to submit applications for funds, after the applications 
are subject to formal peer review by qualified scientists with 
expertise in the fields of criminology, juvenile delinquency, 
sociology, psychology, research methodology, evaluation 
research, statistics and related areas. The peer review process 
is to conform to the process used by NIH, NIJ, or NSF.
    This section strikes Part D of title II of JJDPA, 
concerning Gang-Free Schools and Communities and Community-
Based Gang Intervention. Leading criminologists have determined 
that programs such as these have not been found to be 
effective, and in some cases may cause delinquency, as 
mentioned in the discussion section of this report, so the 
Committee has determined that they should not be funded. These 
grants may also not be relevant to many States as a priority, 
and force States to adhere to particular requirements that may 
not be effective or useful to particular States' problems as 
well.
    This section strikes part E of title II of JJDPA, 
concerning State Challenge Activities. This part currently 
provides States an additional 10 percent of their formula grant 
award for conducting challenge activities the State chooses to 
engage in. Many of these grant activities are unrelated to 
preventing or punishing youth violence, such as, but not 
limited to, the mandates in section 223, and the prevention 
programs have not been determined to be effective. States may 
choose to fund the prevention programs out of their formula 
grants if they believe them to be worthy.
    This section also eliminates part F of title II of JJDPA, 
treatment for juvenile offenders who are victims of child abuse 
and neglect. This part has never been funded, and the Committee 
believes that the Victims of Child Abuse Act that is 
reauthorized by this legislation is effective in removing 
abused children from abusive and criminogenic family settings.
    This section also eliminates part G of title II of JJDPA, 
mentoring. As noted above, expert criminologists have concluded 
that most mentoring programs are ineffective, and some may even 
foster delinquency. States may use their formula grants to fund 
mentoring programs of the type that have not been found to be 
ineffective. For the same reason, this section eliminates part 
H, boot camps. This section also eliminates authorization for 
the White House Conference on Juvenile Justice, which was 
contained in part I of title II of JJDPA.
    This section also authorizes funding of $160 million for 
JJDPA for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000, of which $70 
million is to be expended for State formula grants, $70 million 
is to be made available to NIJJDP (of which not less than $28 
million shall be made available for evaluation research of 
prevention programs, and $16 million is made available for 
child protection, of which $7 million is to be made available 
for title IV of JJDPA). Not more than $4,000,000 shall be 
expended for administrative costs. Dean Schwartz testified that 
OJJDP has 70 staff, which he considers excessive, and which he 
recommended could be cut substantially.
    This section amends section 299 of JJDPA to limit the 
regulatory authority of what is currently called OJJDP. Under 
this section, the Office of Youth Violence Reduction will no 
longer have the authority to promulgate regulations under the 
status offender, separation, jail removal, and minority 
overrepresentation mandates of JJDPA. This has been done 
because the Committee believes that OJJDP has used its 
regulatory authority in this area to impose burdens on States 
based on readings of the statutory language that were never 
intended to be adopted. Accordingly, current OJJDP regulations 
concerning the language of statutory mandates, all of which 
have been changed by this legislation, would be null and void. 
Given OJJDP's prior reading of the current language of the 
mandates, courts interpreting the language of these four 
statutory mandates should accord no deference to the 
interpretation of the Office of Youth Violence Reduction within 
the rule of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense 
Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984).

 SECTION 103. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS 
                               YOUTH ACT

    This section reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth 
Act at its current level of funding for fiscal year 1997, and 
for such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1998, 1999, 
and 2000.

                          SECTION 104. REPEALS

    This section repeals the special study and report contained 
in section 409 of the JJDPA. This section also repeals title V 
of JJDPA. There is no evidence that some of the seven purposes 
for which these grants are effective in preventing or punishing 
youth violence. In addition, title V requires localities which 
obtain these grants to adhere to the mandates of section 223 of 
the Act, mandates unrelated to punishing or preventing youth 
violence. This is an example of a program that has led OJJDP to 
focus on the mandates at the expense of finding out how to stop 
the skyrocketing rates of youth violence around the Nation. The 
Committee is also concerned that the research in the program 
funded by title V is not innovative, and therefore should not 
take up such a large proportion of OJJDP's discretionary grant 
dollars, and has concerns about the means by which technical 
assistance is provided under this program. It believes these 
funds could be better used for researching and evaluating 
issues and programs in preventing and punishing youth violence, 
as well as in providing technical assistance and data 
collection.

                SECTION 201. ANTI-DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1988

    This section repeals subtitles B and C of title III of the 
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. These subtitles authorized 
programs for drug abuse education and prevention programs 
relating to youth gangs and runaway youth and provided 
definitions for terms used therein. These programs have not 
been demonstrated to be effective. This section also eliminates 
section 7295 of the Act, which required an evaluation of 
certain issues by the Comptroller General in 1989.

            SECTION 202. VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE ACT OF 1990

    This section reauthorizes the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 
1990 through fiscal year 2000. This section eliminates the 
language contained in section 223(a) that refers to national 
organizations because testimony received by the Committee 
suggests that this is an inappropriate earmark. However, the 
entity that is the subject of the existing earmark is eligible 
to compete on a level playing field with other applicants for 
NIJJDP research and evaluation grants and contracts. This 
section requires NIJJDP to make grant and contract awards under 
the Victims of Child Abuse Act in accord with the scientific 
standards established in sections 244, 299B, and 299E of title 
II of JJDPA.

   SECTION 301. STUDY AND REPORT BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

    This section requires the Attorney General to enter into a 
contract with the National Academy of Sciences concerning the 
efficacy of the mandates relating to status offenders, 
separation, jail removal, and minority overrepresentation in 
reducing juvenile crime and violence, and in the safety of 
children in the juvenile justice system. The study shall also 
examine the status of research into youth violence, issues and 
topics in youth violence that merit further research, 
methodological approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of 
youth violence prevention efforts, the efficacy of Federal and 
State efforts to control youth violence, and an appropriate 
agenda and budget for continuing research on the problem of 
youth violence to be administered by the Attorney General. This 
section requires that within 12 months after the enactment of 
this legislation, the Attorney General shall submit a report to 
Congress describing the results of the study, and shall make 
this report available to the public.

            SECTION 302. TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS

    This section makes technical and conforming amendments to 
the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                   Washington, DC, August 19, 1996.
Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1952, the Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1996.
    Enacting S. 1952 would not affect direct spending or 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply 
to the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                              James L. Blum
                                   (For June E. O'Neill, Director).
    Enclosure.

               Congressional Budget Office--Cost Estimate

    1. Bill number: S. 1952.
    2. Bill title: Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention 
Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary on August 1, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: S. 1952 would make many changes and 
additions to the federal laws relating to juvenile crime and 
delinquency prevention programs. The bill would authorize the 
appropriation of:
          $160 million for each of the fiscal years 1997 
        through 2000 to the Department of Justice to carry out 
        programs for controlling juvenile crimes and preventing 
        juvenile delinquency;
          $69 million for fiscal year 1997 and such sums as may 
        be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 
        2000 to the Department of Health and Humans Services to 
        make grants for runaway and homeless youth programs;
          $15 million for fiscal year 1997 and such sums as may 
        be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 
        2000 to the Department of Justice to children's 
        advocacy centers;
          $5 million for fiscal year 1997 and such sums as may 
        be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 
        2000 to the Department of Justice to make grants for 
        technical assistance and training programs relating to 
        child abuse cases; and
          $600,000 for fiscal year 1997 to the Department of 
        Justice for a study on juvenile crime.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming 
appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO estimates that 
enacting S. 1952 would result in costs to the Federal 
Government of about $1 billion over the 1997-2002 period. The 
following table summarizes the estimated budgetary effects of 
S. 1952, both with and without adjustments for inflation for 
years in which the authorized amounts are not specified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The 1996 level is the amount appropriated for that year.                                                    

    The costs of this bill fall within budget functions 500 and 
750.
    6. Basis of estimate: For the purpose of this estimate, CBO 
assumes that all amounts authorized by the bill for 1997 and 
all estimated amounts for 1998 through 2000 will be 
appropriated and that outlays will occur at historical rates 
for the authorized activities. ``Such sums'' authorizations 
were estimated by extending, both with and without adjustment 
for inflation, the 1967 authorization provided in the bill.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.
    8. Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal 
governments: S. 1952 contains no intergovernmental mandates as 
defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 
104-4) and would not impose costs on State, local, or tribal 
governments. The bill would authorize $70 million annually for 
fiscal year 1997 through 2000 for State juvenile justice 
formula grants. It would also authorize $69 million in 1997 and 
similar amounts from 1998 through 2000 for grants to public and 
private entities for runaway and homeless youth programs. S. 
1952 would make a number of changes to juvenile justice grant 
provisions, limiting the use of certain funds and revising 
conditions of assistance for state and local governments. The 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 excludes such conditions 
of Federal assistance from the definition of an 
intergovernmental mandate.
    The bill would remove evaluation programs and technical 
implementation assistance from acceptable uses of grant funds. 
It would also require that if less than $75 million is 
appropriated for juvenile justice programs, an individual 
State's allocation shall be between $325,000 and $400,000, 
provided no other state's allocation would fall below its 1996 
level.
    In order for States to qualify for Federal assistance, 
current law requires them to submit a three-year plan outlining 
details of juvenile justice programs and providing for 
continuing evaluation. Under S. 1952, such plans would no long 
have to include the formation of an advisory group, 
governmental distribution guidelines, and privacy assurances. 
In addition, the bill would narrow the focus of programs that 
receive most juvenile justice funding under such plans to those 
dealing with community-based alternatives to incarceration, 
drug and alcohol treatment, juvenile court reform, and crisis 
intervention.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would 
impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: None.
    11. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Mark T. 
Grabowicz. Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Leo 
Lex. Impact on the Private Sector: Matthew Eyles.
    12. Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine, for Paul N. 
Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.

                   VIII. Regulatory Impact Statement

    The accordance with paragraph 11(b), rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rule of the Senate, the Committee, after due 
consideration, concludes that the act will not have significant 
regulatory impact.
         VIII. ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF MESSRS. KENNEDY AND FEINGOLD

    We commend Senator Thompson and Senator Biden for their 
hard work in crafting a bill to reauthorize the Juvenile 
Justice Act. It is clear that they have given considerable 
thought and attention to this vexing problem of juvenile 
justice.
    Although the bill was favorably reported out of the 
committee without a rollcall vote, we have a number of concerns 
about this measure. In its present form, we would be unable to 
support this measure on the Senate floor.
    Most importantly, we have serious concerns about the effect 
of this bill on delinquency prevention and drug treatment 
initiatives. The elimination of categorical prevention programs 
under title V will likely result in the loss of a number of 
very important programs. For example, in Boston, the ``New 
Generations Collaborative'' is an after-school prevention 
program funded under title V. Under this program, at risk 
inner-city teens spend the after school hours in a structured 
setting where they learn the core values that will enable them 
to become productive adults. This program keeps them off the 
streets, and teaches them important skills. A similar program 
for at risk teenage girls in Montague, MA, has been equally 
successful at reducing teen pregnancy and juvenile delinquency.
    Under this reauthorization bill, it will be much more 
difficult for these programs, and others across the Nation, to 
receive funding. Given the new focus of the bill, some States 
may choose to devote significant amounts of their OJJDP block 
grant funds for purposes other than real, primary prevention 
efforts.
    Prevention initiatives are already underfunded, as 
congressional appropriators have adopted a punitive approach to 
criminal justice. For example, congressional appropriators have 
refused to fund a number of prevention initiatives that were 
part of the 1994 crime bill. The Juvenile Justice Act is one of 
the only vehicles through which prevention programs are funded, 
and we are concerned that this source will dry up under this 
reauthorization proposal. Although we acknowledge the need for 
evaluations of existing programs, we do not understand the 
reasoning behind eliminating the few remaining prevention 
programs this Congress has chosen to fund in order to start 
over at square one with a research approach.
    We are also concerned with the bill's lack of a pass-
through provision to ensure that funds filter down to the local 
level. The lack of language ensuring that Indian tribes will 
receive crime prevention funding is equally troubling.
    Further, we are concerned that the bill repeals section 
223(a)(19). This section provides important collective 
bargaining and job protection rights for State juvenile justice 
and youth services workers. It requires that grant recipients, 
as a condition of program eligibility, make fair and equitable 
arrangements for juvenile justice workers who will be employed 
under the terms of the grant. In particular, it guarantees 
workers collective bargaining rights in those States which do 
not have comprehensive labor relations laws for public sector 
employees.
    The repeal of this provision would immediately jeopardize 
the collective bargaining rights of many thousands of juvenile 
justice workers. There is no evidence that this provision has 
posed an unreasonable burden upon States. We would be unable to 
support passage of a juvenile justice reauthorization bill that 
repeals this important worker protection provision. We look 
forward to working with Senators Biden and Thompson to ensure 
that these important worker protection provisions are retained.
    We have a number of other concerns about the bill, and we 
look forward to working with Senator Thompson and Senator Biden 
to resolve them. We appreciate the efforts of Senator Thompson 
and Senator Biden in advancing this Congress' debate on the 
critical issue of juvenile justice.

                                   Russ Feingold.
                                   Ted Kennedy.
                    IX. ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF MR. KOHL

    Senator Thompson and Senator Biden should be commended for 
trying to accomplish what appears to be impossible: crafting a 
bipartisan juvenile justice bill in an election year. At a time 
when some have called for eliminating the Federal role in 
juvenile justice and others have called for merely preserving 
the status quo, this bill arrives at a relatively moderate 
position. Moreover, the proposal recognizes that times have 
changed since Congress wrote the Juvenile Justice Act in 1974. 
Back then, it was designed to protect juveniles from abusive 
prisons and police. This bill, however, properly recognizes 
that today we also need to emphasize protecting the community 
from violent juveniles. So there is much in this bill that we 
should support.
    For example, it is good to see that law enforcement has 
been given more flexibility in dealing with the growing problem 
of juvenile crime. Too often in the past, we have bound police 
hands with redtape restrictions that did little to protect 
juveniles, but did much to interfere with public safety. 
Moreover, this bill dramatically increases funding for research 
and evaluation so that the Federal Government can get serious 
about determining which prevention programs work and which do 
not. And, finally, the bill helps providers of services for 
runaway and homeless youth continue their important work. For 
these reasons, I supported moving this bill out of the 
Judiciary Committee.
    Nevertheless, some parts of this bill remain troublesome 
and other issues remain unaddressed. We must work to see 
changes in these areas before final passage.
    First, at a time when the Appropriations Committee has 
defunded numerous crime prevention programs, this bill 
eliminates the few prevention programs that the Appropriations 
committee is willing to fund. In place of these programs, the 
bill offers two large block grants--one for crime prevention or 
graduated sanctions and the other for research/evaluation or 
demonstration projects. The bottom line, then, is that if a 
State does not want to spend money on programs that help young 
people before they enter the juvenile justice system it can 
avoid doing so whether or not these programs work. I am 
particularly concerned about the elimination of the Local 
Incentive Grants in title V. The General Accounting Office 
recently gave this program a positive evaluation, and it is 
preserved by the House version of this measure, so we ought to 
save it here.
    The Committee Report properly points out that ``[e]very 
witness told the Subcommittee that early intervention and 
prevention efforts are necessary.'' The Report specifically 
notes that distinguished criminologists like Prof. Alfred 
Blumstein, Dr. John Diliulio, and Dean James Alan Fox, along 
with juvenile justice experts like Judge Carol Kelly and Judge 
Kenneth Turner, all agreed on the need for crime prevention 
efforts because, in the words of Professor Diliulio, 
``incarceration is not the answer.'' Finally, the Report 
concludes that ``early intervention'' is essential because ``by 
the time the chronic offenders are identified through their 
actions, the likelihood of successful intervention is low.'
    Just a few pages later, however, the Report suggests that 
the witnesses were only able to cite ``a few OJJDP-funded 
programs'' that had been evaluated and found to be effective. 
In a still later section, the Report then disparages all of the 
prevention programs currently funded by the Office of Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention, thereby justifying the 
bill's elimination of these programs. Somehow, the Committee 
moved from agreeing with the experts that prevention was 
needed, to stating that only a few programs work, to 
disparaging--and defunding--all prevention programs in the 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.
    There is no question that there is much more we need to 
know and Senator Cohen and I have introduced bipartisan 
legislation that would require that a small portion of every 
prevention grant go toward independent evaluation. But given 
the unanimous recognition that we need prevention, and that 
fact that some prevention programs do, in fact, work, why are 
we simultaneously eliminating all of the targeted prevention 
programs in this legislation? Do doctors suspend all AIDS 
treatments while the National Institute of Health continues 
their studies? If we recognize--as this Committee does--that 
some prevention programs work, why shouldn't we fund those 
programs?
    Second, in my opinion we ought to use this measure as a 
vehicle to do something about juvenile records. That does not 
mean that we should make all these records public, of course, 
but we should make sure that the records for the most violent 
juveniles are accessible to police and courts, can be obtained 
by other States, and do not magically disappear when a young 
criminal happens to turn 18. Moreover, if we can come up with 
something as a Committee, it will help us preempt less 
thoughtful, more punitive proposals down the road.
    Finally, this bill does not deal with what many of our 
expert witnesses told the Youth Violence Subcommittee lay at 
the heart of growing youth violence: kids getting--and using--
guns. While the report recognizes the conclusions of Professor 
Fox and Professor Blumstein that the rise in teen murders over 
the last decade is largely due to the proliferation of guns, 
the legislation does not directly address the problem at all. 
At the very least, a thorough juvenile justice reauthorization 
would restore the Gun-Free School Zones law, which the Supreme 
Court struck down last year in the Lopez decision.
     In sum, while I commend the authors for their hard work on 
this measure, I remain concerned that this legislation abandons 
crime prevention efforts at a critical time in our Nation's 
history. All of our witnesses told us that if we want to avoid 
staggering crime problems in the near future, we must intervene 
now with the 39 million American children under the age of ten. 
Instead of following this sensible course, S. 1952 abandons 
current programs in favor of years of more research. We do not 
have time for this wait-and-see approach: we must, as we do in 
all other areas of Government action, fund what works while 
continuing the search for more effective programs.
                       X. Changes in Existing Law

              TITLE I--FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE

                                findings

    [Sec. 101. (a) The Congress hereby finds that--
          [(1) juveniles accounted for almost half the arrests 
        for serious crimes in the United States in 1974 and for 
        less than one-third of such arrests in 1983;
          [(2) recent trends show an upsurge in arrests of 
        adolescents for murder, assault, and weapon use;
          [(3) the small number of youth who commit the most 
        serious and violent offenses are becoming more violent;
          [(4) understaffed, overcrowded juvenile courts, 
        prosecutorial and public defender offices, probation 
        services, and correctional facilities and inadequately 
        trained staff in such courts, services, and facilities 
        are not able to provide individualized justice or 
        effective help;
          [(5) present juvenile courts, foster and protective 
        care programs, and shelter facilities are inadequate to 
        meet the needs of children, who, because of this 
        failure to provide effective services, may become 
        delinquents;
          [(6) existing programs have not adequately responded 
        to the particular problems of the increasing numbers of 
        young people who are addicted to or who abuse alcohol 
        and other drugs, particularly nonopiate or polydrug 
        abusers;
          [(7) juvenile delinquency can be reduced through 
        programs designed to keep students in elementary and 
        secondary schools through the prevention of unwarranted 
        and arbitrary suspensions and expulsions;
          [(8) State and local communities which experience 
        directly the devastating failures of the juvenile 
        justice system do not presently have sufficient 
        technical expertise or adequate resources to deal 
        comprehensively with the problems of juvenile 
        delinquency;
          [(9) existing Federal programs have not provided the 
        direction, coordination, resources, and leadership 
        required to meet the crisis of delinquency;
          [(10) the juvenile justice system should give 
        additional attention to the problem of juveniles who 
        commit serious crimes, with particular attention given 
        to the areas of sentencing, providing resources 
        necessary for informed dispositions, and 
        rehabilitation;
          [(11) emphasis should be placed on preventing youth 
        from entering the juvenile justice system to begin 
        with; and
          [(12) the incidence of juvenile delinquency can be 
        reduced through public recreation programs and 
        activities designed to provide youth with social 
        skills, enhance self esteem, and encourage the 
        constructive use of discretionary time.
    [(b) Congress finds further that the high incidence of 
delinqency in the United States today results in enormous 
annual cost and immeasurable loss of human life, personal 
security, and wasted human resources and that juvenile 
delinquency constitutes a growing threat to the national 
welfare requiring immediate and comprehensive action by the 
Federal Government to reduce and prevent delinquency.

                                [purpose

    [Sec. 102. (a) It is the purpose of this Act--
          [(1) to provide for the thorough and ongoing 
        evaluation of all federally assisted juvenile justice 
        and delinquency prevention programs;
          [(2) to provide technical assistance to public and 
        private nonprofit juvenile justice and delinquency 
        prevention programs;
          [(3) to establish training programs for persons, 
        including professionals, paraprofessionals, and 
        volunteers, who work with delinquents or potential 
        delinquents or whose work or activities relate to 
        juvenile delinquency programs;
          [(4) to establish a centralized research effort on 
        the problems of juvenile delinquency, including the 
        dissemination of the findings of such research and all 
        data related to juvenile delinquency;
          [(5) to develop and encourage the implementation of 
        national standards for the administration of juvenile 
        justice, including recommendations for administrative, 
        budgetary, and legislative action at the Federal, 
        State, and local level to facilitate the adoption of 
        such standards;
          [(6) to assist State and local communities with 
        resources to develop and implement programs to keep 
        students in elementary and secondary schools and to 
        prevent unwarranted and arbitrary suspensions and 
        expulsions;
          [(7) to establish a Federal assistance program to 
        deal with the problems of runaway and homeless youth;
          [(8) to strengthen families in which juvenile 
        delinquency has been a problem;
          [(9) to assist State and local governments in 
        removing juveniles from jails and lockups for adults;

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
          (1) recent statistics show a 60 percent increase in 
        murders committed by juveniles since 1884;
          (2) youth who commit the most serious and violent 
        offenses are becoming more violent, younger offenders 
        are engaging in more violent acts, and the number of 
        violent youth offenders has tripled since 1985;
          (3) understaffed, overcrowded juvenile courts, 
        prosecutorial and public defender offices, probation 
        services, and correctional facilities and inadequately 
        trained staff in such courts, services, and facilities 
        are not able to provide individualized punishment or 
        effective help;
          (4) if recent violent crime rate trends continue, 
        based on the projected growth of the teenage population 
        during the next decade, youth violence will increase 
        dramatically unless new, effective prevention and 
        control strategies are developed and implemented;
          (5) illegitimacy, the decline of marriage, welfare 
        dependence, and youth violence are closely 
        interrelated;
          (6) there is a correlation between child abuse and 
        neglect and delinquency and violence;
          (7) child abuse has increased as the number of babies 
        born to drug-using parents has increased, and children 
        of these parents are at great risk of becoming violent;
          (8) child welfare agencies fail to break the cycle 
        between abuse and delinquency;
          (9) State and local communities that experience 
        directly the devastating failures of the juvenile 
        justice system do not presently have sufficient 
        technical expertise or adequate resources to deal 
        comprehensively with the problems of juvenile 
        delinquency;
          (10) the juvenile justice system has failed to 
        protect the public from violent youths, particularly 
        because a system of certain and graduated punishment is 
        often absent;
          (11) existing programs have not adequately reduced 
        the increasing numbers of young people who are addicted 
        to or who abuse alcohol and other drugs;
          (12) existing Federal programs have not fully 
        provided the research and evaluation necessary to 
        determine which programs designed to prevent youth 
        violence are effective, nor have they led to the most 
        effective dissemination of information regarding 
        effective programs;
          (13) prevention and intervention are more likely to 
        be effective when directed toward younger children 
        before they commit any offenses;
          (14) mandates on States under the Juvenile Justice 
        and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 have been 
        administered in too inflexible a manner, and have made 
        the Act too focused on issues unrelated to preventing 
        or punishing youth violence;
          (15) the juvenile justice system should give 
        additional attention to the problem of juveniles who 
        commit serious crimes and should give greater attention 
        to halting early acts of juvenile delinquency;
          (16) the high incidence of youth violence in the 
        United States results in enormous annual cost and 
        immeasurable loss of human life, personal security, and 
        wasted human resources; and
          (17) youth violence constitutes a growing threat to 
        the national welfare requiring immediate and 
        comprehensive action by the Federal Government to 
        reduce and prevent youth violence.

                        competence, cognitive and creative 
                        competence, vocational competence, and

                        ethics and participation;
                  [(M) programs that, in recognition of varying 
                degrees of the seriousness of delinquent 
                behavior and the corresponding gradations in 
                the responses of the juvenile justice system in 
                response to that behavior, are designed to--
                          [(i) encourage courts to develop and 
                        implement a continuum of post-
                        adjudication restraints that bridge the 
                        gap between traditional probation and 
                        confinement in a correctional setting

                        programs, and secure community-based 
                        treatment facilities linked to other 
                        support services such as health, mental 
                        health, education (remedial and 
                        special), job training, and

                        including technology transfer, to 
                        States in the design and utilization of

                        juvenile justice personnel in 
                        determining appropriate sanctions for 
                        delinquent behavior;
                  [(N) programs designed to prevent and reduce 
                hate crimes committed by juveniles, including

                designed specifically for juveniles who commit 
                hate crimes and that provide alternatives to 
                incarceration; and
                  [(O) programs (including referral to literacy 
                programs and social service programs) to assist 
                families with limited English-speaking ability 
                that include delinquent juveniles to overcome 
                language and cultural barriers that may prevent 
                the complete treatment of such juveniles and 
                the preservation of their families.
          [(11) provide for the development of an adequate 
        research, training, and evaluation capacity within the 
        State;
          [(12)(A) provide within three years after submission

        or who have committed offenses that would not be 
        criminal if committed by an adult or offenses (other 
        than an offense that constitutes a violation of a valid 
        court order or a violation of section 922(x) of title 
        18, United States Code, or a similar State law)., or 
        alien juveniles in custody, or such nonoffenders as 
        dependent or neglected children, shall not be placed in 
        secure detention facilities or secure correctional 
        facilities; and
          [(B) provide that the State shall submit annual 
        reports to the Administrator containing a review of the 
        progress made by the State to achieve the 
        deinstitutionalization of juveniles described in 
        subparagraph (A) and a review of the progress made by 
        the State to provide that such juveniles, if placed in 
        facilities, are placed in facilities which (i) are the 
        least restrictive alternatives appropriate to the needs 
        of the child and the community; (ii) are in reasonable 
        proximity to the family and the home communities of 
        such juveniles; and (iii) provide the services 
        described in section 103(1);
          [(13) provide that juveniles alleged to be or found 
        to be delinquent and youths within the purview of 
        paragraph (12) shall not be detained or confined in any 
        institution in which they have contact with adult 
        persons incarcerated because they have been convicted 
        of a crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges or 
        with the part-time or full-time security staff 
        (including management) or direct-care staff of a jail 
        or lockup for adults;
          [(14) provide that, beginning after the five-year 
        period following December 8, 1980, no juvenile shall be 
        detained or confined in any jail or lockup for adults, 
        except that the Administrator shall, through 1997, 
        promulgate regulations which make exceptions with 
        regard to the detention of juveniles accused of 
        nonstatus offenses who are awaiting an initial court 
        appearance pursuant to an enforceable State law 
        requiring such appearances within twenty-four hours 
        after being taken into custody (excluding weekends and 
        holidays) provided that such exceptions are limited to 
        areas that are in compliance with paragraph (13) and--
                  [(A)(i) are outside a Standard Metropolitan 
                Statistical Area; and
                  [(ii) have no existing acceptable alternative 
                placement available;
                  [(B) are located where conditions of distance 
                to be traveled or the lack of highway, road, or 
                other ground transportation do not allow for 
                court appearances within 24 hours, so that a 
                brief (not to exceed 48 hours) delay is 
                excusable; or
                  [(C) are located where conditions of safety 
                exist (such as severely adverse, life-
                threatening weather conditions that do not 
                allow for reasonably safe travel), in which 
                case the time for an appearance may be delayed 
                until 24 hours after the time that such 
                conditions allow for reasonably safe travel;
          [(15) provide for an adequate system of monitoring 
        jails, detention facilities, correctional facilities, 
        and non-secure facilities to insure that the 
        requirements of paragraph (12)(A), paragraph (13), and 
        paragraph (14) are met, and for annual reporting of the 
        results of such monitoring to the Administrator, except 
        that such reporting requirements shall not apply in the 
        case of a State which is in compliance with the other 
        requirements of this paragraph, which is in compliance 
        with the requirements in paragraph (12)(A) and 
        paragraph (13), and which has enacted legislation which 
        conforms to such requirements and which contains, in 
        the opinion of the Administrator, sufficient 
        enforcement mechanisms to ensure that such legislation 
        will be administered effectively;
          [(16) provide assurance that youth in the juvenile 
        justice system are treated equitably on the basis of 
        gender, race, family income, and mentally, emotionally, 
        or physically handicapping conditions;
          [(17) provide assurance that consideration will be 
        given to and that assistance will be available for 
        approaches designed to strengthen the families of 
        delinquent and other youth to prevent juvenile 
        delinquency (which approaches should include the 
        involvement of grandparents or other extended family 
        members when possible and appropriate and the provision 
        of family counseling during the incarceration of 
        juvenile family members and coordination of family 
        services when appropriate and feasible);
          [(18) provide for procedures to be established for 
        protecting the rights of recipients of services and for 
        assuring appropriate privacy with regard to records 
        relating to such services provided to any individual 
        under the State plan;
          [(19) provide that fair and equitable arrangements 
        shall be made to protect the interests of employees 
        affected by assistance under this Act and shall provide 
        for the terms and conditions of such protective 
        arrangements established pursuant to this section, and 
        such protective arrangements shall, to the maximum 
        extent feasible, include, without being limited to, 
        such provisions as may be necessary for--
                  [(A) the preservation of rights, privileges, 
                and benefits (including continuation of pension 
                rights and benefits) under existing collective-
                bargaining agreements or otherwise;
                  [(B) the continuation of collective-
                bargaining rights;
                  [(C) the protection of individual employees 
                against a worsening of their positions with 
                respect to their employment;
                  [(D) assurances of employment to employees of 
                any State or political subdivision thereof who 
                will be affected by any program funded in whole 
                or in part under provisions of this Act; and
                  [(E) training or retraining programs;
          [(20) provide for such fiscal control and fund 
        accounting procedures necessary to assure prudent use, 
        proper disbursement, and accurate accounting of funds 
        received under this title;
          [(21) provide reasonable assurances that Federal 
        funds made available under this part for any period 
        will be so used as to supplement and increase (but not 
        supplant) the level of the State, local, and other non-
        Federal funds that would in the absence of such Federal 
        funds be made available for the programs described in 
        this part, and will in no event replace such State, 
        local, and other non-Federal funds;
          [(22) provide that the State agency designated under 
        paragraph (1) will from time to time, but not less 
        often than annually, review its plan and submit to the 
        Administrator an analysis and evaluation of the 
        effectiveness of the programs and activities carried 
        out under the plan, and any modifications in the plan, 
        including the survey of State and local needs, which it 
        considers necessary;
          [(23) address efforts to reduce the proportion of 
        juveniles detained or confined in secure detention 
        facilities, secure correctional facilities, jails, and 
        lockups who are members of minority groups if such 
        proportion exceeds the proportion such groups represent 
        in the general population;
          [(24) contain such other terms and conditions as the 
        Administrator may reasonably prescribe to assure the 
        effectiveness of the programs assisted under this 
        title; and
          [(25) provide an assurance that if the State receives 
        under section 222 for any fiscal year an amount that 
        exceeds 105 percent of the amount the State received 
        under such section for fiscal year 1992, all of such 
        excess shall be expended through or for programs that 
        are part of a comprehensive and coordinated community 
        system of services.
    [(b) The State agency designated under subsection (a)(1), 
after receiving and considering the advice and recommendations 
of the advisory group referred to in subsection (a), shall 
approve the State plan and any modification thereof prior to 
submission to the Administrator.
    [(c)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Administrator shall 
approve any State plan and any modification thereof that meets 
the requirements of this section.
    [(2) Failure to achieve compliance with the subsection 
(a)(12)(A) requirement within the 3-year time limitation shall 
terminate any State's eligibility for funding under this part 
for a fiscal year beginning before January 1, 1993, unless the 
Administrator determines that the State is in substantial 
compliance with the requirement, through achievement of 
deinstitutionalization of not less than 75 percent of such 
juveniles or through removal of 100 percent of such juveniles 
from secure correctional facilities, and has made, through 
appropriate executive or legislative action, an unequivocal 
commitment to achieving full compliance within a reasonable 
time not exceeding 2 additional years.
    [(3) If a State fails to comply with the requirements of 
subsection (a), (12)(A), (13), (14), or (23) in any fiscal year 
beginning after January 1, 1993--
          [(A) subject to subparagraph (B), the amount allotted 
        under section 222 to the State for that fiscal year 
        shall be reduced by 25 percent for each such paragraph 
        with respect to which noncompliance occurs; and
          [(B) the State shall be ineligible to receive any 
        allotment under that section for such fiscal year 
        unless--
                  [(i) the State agrees to expend all the 
                remaining funds the State receives under this 
                part (excluding funds required to be expended 
                to comply with section 222 (c) and (d) and with 
                section 223(a)(5)(C)) for that fiscal year only 
                to achieve compliance with any such paragraph 
                with respect to which the State is in 
                noncompliance; or
                  [(ii) the Administrator determines, in the 
                discretion of the Administrator, that the 
                State--
                          [(I) has achieved substantial 
                        compliance with each such paragraph 
                        with respect to which the State was not 
                        in compliance; and
                          [(II) has made, through appropriate 
                        executive or legislative action, an 
                        unequivocal commitment to achieving 
                        full compliance within a reasonable 
                        time.
    [(d) In the event that any State chooses not to submit a 
plan, fails to submit a plan, or submits a plan or any 
modification thereof, which the Administrator, after reasonable 
notice and opportunity for hearing, in accordance with sections 
802, 803, and 804 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and 
Safe Streets Act of 1968, determines does not meet the 
requirements of this section, the Administrator shall endeavor 
to make that State's allotment under the provisions of section 
222(a), excluding funds the Administrator shall make available 
to satisfy the requirement specified in section 222(d), 
available to local public and private non-profit agencies 
within such State for use in carrying out activities of the 
kinds described in subsection (a) (12)(A), (13), (14) and (23). 
The Administrator shall make funds which remain available after 
disbursements are made by the Administrator under the preceding 
sentence, and any other unobligated funds, available on an 
equitable basis to those States that have achieved full 
compliance with the requirements under subsection (a) (12)(A), 
(13), (14) and (23).]

SEC. 223. STATE PLANS.

    (a) In General.--In order to be eligible to receive formula 
grants under this part, each State shall--
          (1) ensure that not less than 75 percent of the funds 
        made available to the State under section 222, whether 
        expended directly by the State, by the unit of general 
        local government, or by a combination thereof, or 
        through grants and contracts with public or private 
        nonprofit agencies, shall be used--
                  (A) for prevention and nonincarcerative 
                intervention, including drug and alcohol 
                treatment activities, and programs that 
                encourage courts to develop and implement a 
                continuum of post-adjudication restraints that 
                bridge the gap between probation and 
                confinement in a correctional facility, 
                including graduated sanctions for youth 
                offenders; and
                  (B) for implementing a system whereby every 
                offender receives some sanction for every 
                crime, except that such funds shall not be used 
                on initiatives that the organization created by 
                section 241 determines do not prevent or reduce 
                youth violence;
          (2) provide for records to be kept by recipients of 
        funds made available to the State under section 222 
        sufficient for the organization created by section 241 
        to monitor whether the use of said funds has prevented 
        or reduced youth violence;
          (3) ensure that juveniles who are charged with or who 
        have committed offenses that would not be criminal if 
        committed by an adult (other than an offense that 
        constitutes a violation of a valid court order or a 
        violation of section 922(x) of title 18, United States 
        Code, or a similar State law), or alien juveniles in 
        custody, or such nonoffenders as dependent or neglected 
        children, shall not be placed in secure detention 
        facilities or secure correctional facilities, except 
        that the juvenile or family court may detain, after a 
        hearing, in a secure detention facility for a limited 
        period of time, not to exceed 72 hours, a runaway, 
        truant, or incorrigible youth, if the youth--
                  (A) received a previous official court 
                warning that an additional instance of such 
                behavior would result in the secure detention 
                of that youth; or
                  (B) the chronic behavior of the youth 
                constitutes a clear and present danger to the 
                physical or emotional well-being of the youth 
                or the physical safety of the community, if the 
                juvenile's detention is for not more than the 
                amount of time necessary to eliminate such 
                danger through detention or through other 
                treatment, and secure detention is the least 
                restrictive means available for guarding the 
                safety of the youth or the community;
          (4) submit an annual report to the Administrator 
        describing the status of compliance with this section 
        and containing a review of the progress made by the 
        State to achieve the deinstitutionalization of 
        juveniles described in paragraph (3) and a review of 
        the progress made by the State to provide that such 
        juveniles, if placed in facilities, are placed in 
        facilities that--
                  (A) are the least restrictive alternatives 
                appropriate to the needs of the child and the 
                community;
                  (B) are in reasonable proximity to the family 
                and the home communities of such juveniles; and
                  (C) provide the services described in section 
                103(1);
          (5) provide that juveniles alleged to be or found to 
        be delinquent and youths under paragraph (3) shall not 
        be detained or confined in any institution in which 
        they have regular contact with adult persons 
        incarcerated because they have been convicted of a 
        crime or are awaiting trial on criminal charges or with 
        the part-time or full-time security staff (including 
        management) or direct-care staff of a jail or lockup 
        for adults, unless that staff has been properly trained 
        and certified by the State to deal with juvenile 
        offenders, and staff is not dealing directly with both

        groups, psychometerically sound measurement, and 
        appropriate data analysis techniques;
          (2) the experience of the principal and co-principal 
        investigators in the area of youth violence and

written determination waiving the competitive [process--
          (i) with respect to programs] process with respect to 
        programs to be carried out in areas with respect to 
        which the President declares under the Robert T.

    (2)[(A) Programs selected for assistance through grants or 
contracts under [this part] section 243 (other than section 
241(f)) shall be reviewed before selection, and thereafter as 
appropriate, through a formal peer review process utilizing 
experts (other than officers and employees of the Department of

part] Section 243 (and the applications submitted for such 
grants and contracts) shall, upon being made, be transmitted by 
the [Administrator] Director, to the chairman of the [Committee
