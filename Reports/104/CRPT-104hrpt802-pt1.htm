SEC. 2. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE HOUSING IMPROVEMENT ACT.

  (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
          (1) to develop where necessary an adequate supply of quality 
        housing units for field employees of the National Park Service 
        within a reasonable time frame;
          (2) to expand the alternatives available for construction and 
        repair of essential government housing;
          (3) to rely on the private sector to finance or supply 
        housing in carrying out this section, to the maximum extent 
        possible, in order to reduce the need for Federal 
        appropriations;
          (4) to provide increased opportunities for the ownership of 
        housing by field employees, together with the equity and tax 
        benefits associated with home ownership;
          (5) to ensure that adequate funds are available to provide 
        for long-term maintenance needs of field employee housing; and
          (6) to eliminate unnecessary government housing and locate 
        such housing as is required in a manner such that primary 
        resource values are not impaired.
  (b) General Authority.--To enhance the ability of the Secretary of 
the Interior (hereinafter in this section referred to as ``the 
Secretary''), acting through the Director of the National Park Service, 
to effectively manage units of the National Park System, and 
notwithstanding any provision of section 5536 of title 5, United States 
Code, the Secretary is authorized where necessary and justified to make 
available employee housing and essential amenities, on or off the lands 
under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park Service, and 
to rent or lease such housing to field employees of the National Park 
Service at a reasonable value commensurate with rent or leasing of 
housing of comparable value in the local community.
  (c) Review and Revision of Housing Criteria.--Upon the enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall review and revise the existing criteria 
under which housing is provided to employees of the National Park 
Service. The review and revision shall include consideration of the 
following criteria:
          (1) Required occupancy (whether and under what circumstances 
        the Park Service requires, as a condition of employment, that 
        an employee live at a particular site or in a specific 
        geographic area). For each instance in which occupancy is 
        required, full consideration shall be given to the concept of 
        adequate response time.
          (2) Availability and adequacy of non-Federal housing in the 
        geographic area, including consideration of the degree of 
        isolation (the time and distance that separate other potential 
        housing from the workplace of a Park Service employee).
          (3) Category of employment (seasonal or permanent).
          (4) Any other factor that the Secretary considers 
        appropriate.
  (d) Submission of Report.--A report detailing the results of the 
revisions required by subsection (c) shall be submitted to the 
Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate not later than 
180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. The report shall 
include justifications for keeping, or for changing, each of the 
criteria or factors used by the Department of the Interior with regard 
to the provision of housing to employees of the National Park Service.
  (e) Review of Condition of and Costs Relating to Housing.--Using the 
revised criteria developed under subsection (c), the Secretary shall 
undertake a review, for each unit of the National Park System, of 
existing government-owned housing provided to employees of the National 
Park Service. The review shall include an assessment of the physical 
condition of such housing and the suitability of such housing to 
effectively carry out the missions of the Department of the Interior 
and the National Park Service. For each unit of such housing, the 
Secretary shall determine whether the unit is needed and justified. The 
review shall include estimates of the cost of bringing each such unit 
that is needed and justified into usable condition that meets all 
applicable legal housing requirements or, if the unit is determined to 
be obsolete but is still warranted to carry out the missions of the 
Department of the Interior and the National Park Service, the cost of 
replacing the unit.
  (f) Authorization for Housing Agreements.--For those units of the 
National Park System for which the review required by subsections (c) 
and (e) has been completed, the Secretary is authorized pursuant to the 
authorities contained in this Act, to enter into housing agreements 
with housing entities under which such housing entities may develop, 
construct, rehabilitate, or manage housing, located on or off public 
lands, for rent or lease to National Park Service employees who meet 
the housing eligibility criteria developed by the Secretary pursuant to 
this Act.
  (g) Joint Public-Private Sector Housing Programs.--
          (1) Lease to build program.--The Secretary may--
                  (A) lease Federal land and interests in land to

                employee quarters and essential amenities for any 
                period not to exceed 50 years; and
                  (B) lease developed and undeveloped non-Federal land 
                for providing field employee quarters.
          (2) Competitive leasing.--Each lease under paragraph (1)(A) 
        shall be awarded through the use of publicly advertised, 
        competitively bid, or competitively negotiated contracting 
        procedures, except that a lease to a field employee housing 
        cooperative may be awarded noncompetitively if construction on 
        the leased land is then competitively bid or competitively 
        negotiated.
          (3) Terms and conditions.--Each lease under paragraph 
        (1)(A)--
                  (A) shall stipulate whether operation and maintenance 
                of field employee quarters is to be provided by the 
                lessee, field employees or the Federal Government;
                  (B) shall require that the construction and 
                rehabilitation of field employee quarters be done in 
                accordance with the requirements of the National Park 
                Service and local applicable building codes and 
                industry standards;
                  (C) shall contain such additional terms and 
                conditions as may be appropriate to protect the Federal 
                interest, including limits on rents the lessee may 
                charge field employees for the occupancy of quarters, 
                conditions on maintenance and repairs, and agreements 
                on the provision of charges for utilities and other 
                infrastructure;
                  (D) may provide that, upon termination of the lease, 
                the contractor shall abandon the quarters constructed 
                on the property subject to such lease and thereafter 
                ownership shall vest in the United States or restore 
                the property to its natural state; and
                  (E) may be granted at less than fair market value if 
                the Secretary determines that such lease will improve 
                the quality and availability of field employee quarters 
                available.
          (4) Contributions by united states.--The Secretary may make 
        payments or contributions in kind to reduce the costs of

        third party presence is needed or required, and approved by the 
        Secretary concerned.
  (h) Rental Guarantee Program.--
          (1) General authority.--The Secretary may enter into a lease 
        to build arrangement as set forth in subsection (c) with 
        further agreement to guarantee, the occupancy of field employee 
        quarters constructed or rehabilitated under such lease. A 
        guarantee made under this subsection shall be in writing.
          (2) Limitations.--The Secretary may not guarantee--
                  (A) the occupancy of more than 97 percent of the 
                units constructed or rehabilitated under such lease; 
                and
                  (B) a rental rate that exceeds the rates established 
                under subsection (j)(3).
          (3) Rental to government employees.--A guarantee may be made 
        under this subsection only if the lessee agrees to permit the

        for which the guarantee is made.
          (4) Failure to maintain a satisfactory level of operation and

  (i) Joint Development Authority.--
          (1) In general.--The Secretary may use authorities granted by

        providing where necessary and justified affordable field 
        employee housing.
          (2) Condition.--The Secretary may condition private 
        development upon provision and management of field employee 
        housing for the Federal Government in the affected location.
  (j) Contracts for the Management of Field Employee Quarters.--
          (1) General authority.--The Secretary may enter into 
        contracts for the management, repair, and maintenance of field 
        employee quarters.
          (2) Terms and conditions.--Any such contract shall contain 
        such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary or 
        appropriate to protect the interests of the United States and 
        assure that safe, affordable quarters are available to that 
        agency's field employees.
          (3) Rents.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any 
        such contract may provide for the setting of rents at rates to

          (1) Sale of quarters.--
                  (A) General authority.--Notwithstanding any other 
                provision of law, the Secretary may sell field employee

                field employees of the agency.
                  (B) Interest in lands.--The Secretary may only sell a

          (5) Fair market value.--The Secretary may sell or transfer 
        employee quarters under this subsection for less than fair 
        market value if the Secretary determines that such a sale or

        (40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.).
          (7) Notice.--The Secretary may not take any action authorized

  (l) Leasing of Seasonal Employee Quarters.--
          (1) General authority.--Subject to paragraph (2), the 
        Secretary may lease quarters at or near a unit of the park 
        system for use as seasonal quarters for field employees. The 
        rent charged to field employees under such a lease shall be 
        that amount which is equal to reasonable value.
          (2) Limitation.--The Secretary may only issue a lease under 
        paragraph (1) if the Secretary finds that there is a shortage 
        of adequate and affordable seasonal quarters at or near such 
        unit and that--
                  (A) the requirement for such seasonal field employee 
                quarters is temporary; or
                  (B) leasing would be more cost effective than 
                construction of new seasonal field employee quarters.
          (3) Unrecovered costs.--The Secretary may pay the unrecovered 
        costs of leasing seasonal quarters under this subsection from 
        annual appropriations for the year in which such lease is made.
          (4) Rental to nongovernmental persons.--The Secretary may 
        rent seasonal quarters on Government lands to nongovernment 
        persons during those times that such units are not required for 
        seasonal employees, except that the Secretary may only rent 
        such quarters if the Secretary determines the rent exceeds the 
        cost of providing such quarters.
  (m) Survey of Existing Facilities.--The Secretary shall--
          (1) complete a condition assessment for all field employee 
        housing, including the physical condition of such housing and 
        the necessity and suitability of such housing for the effective 
        prosecution of the agency mission, using existing information; 
        and
          (2) develop a agency-wide priority listing, by structure, 
        identifying those units in greatest need for repair, 
        rehabilitation, replacement, or initial construction.
  (n) Use of Housing-Related Funds.--Expenditure of any funds 
authorized and appropriated for new construction, repair, or 
rehabilitation of housing under this section shall follow the housing 
priority listing established by the agency under subsection (m), in 
sequential order, to the maximum extent practicable.
  (o) Annual Budget Submittal.--The President's proposed budget to 
Congress for the first fiscal year beginning after enactment of this 
Act, and for each subsequent fiscal year, shall include for each agency 
under this section, identification of nonconstruction funds to be spent 
for housing maintenance and operations which are in addition to rental 
receipts collected.
  (p) Employee Transportation.--The Secretary may use applicable 
appropriations of the National Park System for transportation to and 
from work, outside of regular working hours, of field employees, 
residing in or near a national park system unit, such transportation to 
be between the unit and the city, or intervening points, at reasonable 
rates to be determined by the Secretary taking into consideration, 
among other factors, comparable rates charged by transportation 
companies in the locality for similar services, the amounts collected 
for such transportation to be credited to the current appropriation 
account available for administration of the park system unit concerned 
and shall be available to the Secretary for obligation or expenditure, 
notwithstanding section 1341 of title 31, United States Code, for 
administration of such unit. Any surplus proceeds shall be retained by 
the agency for those purposes until expended. If adequate 
transportation facilities are available, or shall be available by any 
common carrier, at reasonable rates, then and in that event the 
services contemplated by this subsection shall not be offered.
  (q) Study of Housing Allowances.--Within 12 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall conduct a study to determine 
the feasibility of providing eligible employees of the National Park 
Service with housing allowances rather than government housing. The 
study shall specifically examine the feasibility of providing rental 
subsidies to temporary and lower paid permanent employees. Whenever the 
Secretary submits a copy of such study to the Office of Management and 
Budget, he shall concurrently transmit copies of the report to the 
Resources Committee of the United States House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States 
Senate.
  (r) General Provisions.--
          (1) Construction limitations on federal lands.--The Secretary 
        may not utilize any lands for the purposes of providing field 
        employee housing under this section which could impact primary 
        resource values of the area or adversely affect the mission of 
        the agency. Any construction carried out under this section 
        shall be fully consistent with approved land management agency 
        plans.

                make an adjustment for a calendar year in the rental 
                rates established under paragraph (1). Such adjustment 
                may not exceed the Department of Labor's then 
                applicable Consumer Price Index Residential Rent Series 
                annual adjustment factor except for increases 
                attributable to utility rates and other Government 
                provided services and improvements provided by the 
                United States.
          (3) Availability of quarters.--In carrying out this section 
        and section 5911 of title 5, United States Code, with respect

        Secretary of leases under this section.

(g)(1)(A)(i), any sale or lease under subsection (k)(1), and any lease 
of seasonal quarters under subsection (l), may, notwithstanding section 
3302 of title 31, United States Code, be retained by the land 
management agency entering into such sale or lease. Such proceeds shall 
be credited to the current appropriation account available for payment 
of costs related to the housing program, including administration, 
maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and construction activities. Such 
proceeds shall be available to the agency, notwithstanding section 1341 
of title 31, United States Code, for obligation or expenditure by the 
agency for such purposes and shall be retained by the agency for those 
purposes until expended.

  Section 4 of the Act entitled ``An Act to improve the administration 
of the national park system by the Secretary of the Interior, and to 
clarify the authorities applicable to the system, and for other 
purposes'' approved August 18, 1970 (16 U.S.C. 1a-1 et seq.), is 
amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR PARK FACILITIES OUTSIDE BOUNDARIES OF 
                    SYSTEM UNITS.

  ``(a) Authority.--In order to facilitate the administration of the 
national park system, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized, 
under such terms and conditions as he may deem advisable, to establish 
essential facilities for park administration, visitor use, and park 
employee residential housing outside the boundaries, but within the 
vicinity, of units of the national park system for purposes of assuring 
conservation, visitor use, and proper management of such units. Such 
facilities, and the use thereof, shall be in conformity with approved 
plans for the unit concerned. The Secretary shall use existing 
facilities wherever feasible. Such facilities may only be constructed 
by the Secretary upon finding that location of such facilities would--
          ``(1) avoid undue degradation of the primary natural or 
        cultural resources within the unit;
          ``(2) enhance service to the public; or
          ``(3) provide a cost saving to the Federal Government.
  ``(b) Agreements, Leases, Guidelines, and Construction.--For the 
purpose of establishing facilities under subsection (a):
          ``(1) The Secretary may enter into agreements permitting the 
        Secretary to use for such purposes those Federal lands that the 
        head of a Federal agency having primary authority over the 
        administration of such land and the Secretary determine to be 
        suitable for such use.
          ``(2) The Secretary, under such terms and conditions as the 
        Secretary determines are reasonable, may lease or acquire (from 
        willing sellers only) by purchase or donation, real property 
        (other than Federal land), for the purposes specified in this 
        section.
          ``(3) For real property acquired pursuant to paragraph (2), 
        the Secretary shall establish written guidelines setting forth 
        criteria to be used in determining whether the acquisition 
        would--
                  ``(A) reflect unfavorably upon the ability of the 
                Department or an employee to carry out its 
                responsibilities or official duties in a fair and 
                objective manner; or
                  ``(B) compromise the integrity, or the appearance of 
                integrity, of the Department's programs or of any 
                official involved in those programs.
          ``(4) The Secretary may construct, operate, and maintain such 
        permanent and temporary buildings and facilities as the 
        Secretary deems appropriate on land which is in the vicinity of 
        any unit of the national park system for which the Secretary 
        has acquired authority under this section, except that the 
        Secretary may not begin construction, operation, or maintenance 
        of buildings or facilities on land not owned by the United 
        States until the owner of such lands has entered into a binding 
        agreement with the Secretary, the terms of which assure the 
        continued use of such buildings and facilities for a period of 
        time commensurate with the level of Federal investment.
  ``(c) Cooperative Agreements and Joint Ventures for Infrastructure 
Facilities.--The Secretary is authorized to enter into cooperative 
agreements or joint ventures with local or State governmental agencies, 
other Federal agencies, Indian Tribes, and private entities either on 
or off the lands subject to the jurisdiction of the Secretary, to 
provide appropriate and necessary utility and other infrastructure 
facilities in support of park administration, visitor use, and park 
employee residential housing.''.

        marine or aquatic park resource'' after ``any park system 
        resource''.

                          Purpose of the Bill

    The purposes of H.R. 2941 are to address a number of 
administrative issues facing the National Park Service (NPS) 
including: improving the quality of employee housing, providing 
for generic minor park boundary adjustment authority, 
authorizing the NPS to spend funds outside park boundaries for 
visitor and administrative facilities, reauthorization of the 
NPS Advisory Board, requiring the Director of the NPS be 
subject to Senate confirmation, eliminating unnecessary 
Congressional reporting requirements, and providing permanent 
authority for challenge cost share agreements.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

                     National Park Service Housing

    Overall the Federal Government has about 19,000 non-
military housing units distributed nationwide. The most 
significant inventory of housing units outside of the military 
is with the four Federal land management agencies, which 
collectively have about 11,000 housing units. The quality of 
housing available to Federal employees is a very important 
issue to many employees of the Federal land management 
agencies, especially those persons in more remote locations, 
where no private sector housing is available. It is also of 
great importance to area managers because of its relationship 
to recruitment and retention of quality employees.
    The General Accounting Office (GAO) has recently completed 
two reports on housing programs of the land management agencies 
(RCED 93-192 and RCED 94-284). NPS housing is in the greatest 
need of attention.
    The NPS has an inventory of about 4,700 housing units, more 
than any other land management agency. About 60 percent of the 
housing is occupied by permanent employees, and the balance is 
occupied by seasonal employees. The NPS housing consists of 
older housing built prior to establishment of the parks, and 
during two major construction periods, the 1920s and 1960s. As 
of 1992, 40 percent of the housing was in good condition, about 
45 percent was in fair condition and 15 percent was in poor 
condition. The NPS estimates that $546 million is needed to 
address the backlog in housing; however, GAO could not verify 
these estimates. Since Fiscal Year 1989, Congress has 
appropriated about $70 million to address this backlog of 
housing needs.
    There is no question that housing is in need of improvement 
and that there are many housing horror stories. It is also 
clear that rental payments and appropriations for new housing 
construction are not going to be adequate to fully upgrade or 
provide long-term maintenance for the existing housing stock.
    There are several issues which must be addressed in any 
comprehensive housing legislation. First, what steps can be 
taken by the agencies to reduce the need for Federal Government 
housing to the maximum extent possible? Second, what is the 
accurate estimate of costs to upgrade the existing housing 
stock and to maintain the housing over the long term? Third, 
how do we develop systems which ensure that existing funds 
(both appropriated and rental payments) are directed to the 
highest priority needs? And fourth, what authorities can be 
provided to develop other sources of funding for solving this 
problem, such as private sector funding or employee funding, 
where employees could earn equity from their housing payments?

                       Minor Boundary Adjustments

    Each Congress, a substantial amount of work is focused on 
making minor boundary adjustments at various units of the park 
system. Currently the NPS has minor boundary adjustment 
authority only at certain parks in the country. That authority 
exists by virtue of the language in the enabling legislation of 
the various park areas and in the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund Act of 1965 for park areas established after 1965.
    Often these boundary adjustments are so insignificant in 
the overall Congressional agenda that it can take years to 
secure enough Congressional support for passage. For example, 
legislation to modify the boundary at Independence National 
Historical Park by a couple of hundred square yards is now 
being considered by the third consecutive Congress. Of course, 
this does not mean this modification is not important to the 
NPS or the public.
    As stated above, generic minor boundary adjustment 
authority is now provided for all NPS areas designated after 
1965, and all other areas with specific legislative authority. 
This results in an inconsistent treatment among park areas. 
There is no magic to providing such authority to areas 
established after 1965. If it is good policy, it should apply 
to all areas, except where otherwise specified, without respect 
to an artificial qualifying date.
    The current boundary adjustment authority is also 
inconsistent with respect to where it is applied and how it is 
applied. In recent years, the agency has made a number of 
inconsistent determinations as to what is ``minor.'' In 
response to a question from the former Subcommittee Ranking 
Member as to what constitutes ``minor,'' Department of the 
Interior Secretary Lujan declined to reveal any criteria rather 
than limit his administrative flexibility. Recently, Congress 
has enacted legislation to accept a 16-acre donation at 
Ocmulgee National Monument. On the other hand, the NPS made a 
boundary adjustment at Golden Gate National Recreation Area to 
add about 16 acres which includes a former Public Health 
Service hospital. That property represents a potential 
liability to the Federal Government of over $50 million.
    Therefore, it is important for the Administration and 
Congress to have a set of criteria by which to judge exactly 
what constitutes a minor boundary adjustment. Absent some 
clarifying criteria, future Administrations will be able to 
make the case that such adjustments are ``minor'' and can 
therefore proceed without Congressional scrutiny.

         Expenditure of the Park Funds Outside Park Boundaries

    An Act of Congress is required whenever the NPS seeks 
authority to expend funds for construction outside of a park 
for administrative or visitor facilities, since the agency has 
no such generic authority. There are many instances where this 
is required: to establish an interagency visitor center, to 
provide housing for park employees outside the park, or to 
locate park administrative facilities at other than General 
Services Administration buildings outside a park area. There 
are currently a number of bills going through Congress which 
could be addressed by such generic legislation.
    Generic authority for expenditure of NPS funds outside park 
boundaries is needed. As NPS begins to examine more innovative 
strategies to manage its lands and begins to work more 
cooperatively with others, there is a strong need to provide 
this administrative flexibility. This bill provides that 
flexibility while protecting the essential Federal Government 
interest.

       National Park Service Congressional Reporting Requirements

    Over the years, numerous Congressional reporting 
requirements for the NPS have been enacted into law. While many 
of these reporting requirements probably served an important 
function in the past, many others are no longer necessary. At a 
time when Congress is attempting to downsize the agencies and 
reduce the overall administrative burdens, it is important to 
examine the need for all the reports and the cost-effectiveness 
of these reports.

         Senate Confirmation of National Park Service Director

    Of the four Federal land management agencies, two are 
headed by persons subject to Senate confirmation (Bureau of 
Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service), the 
Forest Service chief is a career SES position and the NPS is 
headed by a political appointee without confirmation.
    For the first 56 years of the NPS, up until George Hartzog 
was fired by President Nixon, the NPS was headed by a director 
who came from the ranks of the agency. While two of the 
Directors since that time have been professionals from the 
agency, others had little professional experience in park 
management.
    In the past, legislation to establish the position of the 
NPS Director as a position subject to Senate confirmation has 
been carried in both the House and the Senate by Members from 
both parties. The language has been passed by the House twice 
as part of broader legislative efforts, but has never been 
acted on in the Senate.
    No matter what approach is adopted for selection of the NPS 
Director, it would be impossible to take all the politics out 
of the selection process. Nor should all the politics be taken 
out; after all the Director of the NPS deals with politics 
every day. However, in an agency as decentralized as the NPS, 
the need for a strong Director is even greater. It is also 
important that the Director be familiar with the agency. A 
parade of four-year appointments is especially difficult when 
the Director spends the first few years just learning about the 
agency, and specifying qualifications will ensure the 
individual is better suited to undertake the task. National 
park superintendents are generally very supportive of 
professionalizing the position of the agency Director.

                            Committee Action

    H.R. 2941 was introduced on February 1, 1996, by 
Congressman Joel Hefley (R-CO). The bill was referred primarily 
to the Committee on Resources, and in addition to the Committee 
on Agriculture. Within the Committee on Resources, the bill was 
referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and 
Lands. On March 5, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
H.R. 2941, where the Subcommittee received additional testimony 
regarding the overall poor quality of field employee housing 
and the NPS testified in support of legislative remedies to 
these problems. On April 18, 1996, the Subcommittee met to mark 
up H.R. 2941. Congressman James V. Hansen (R-UT) offered an 
amendment in the nature of a substitute that was adopted by 
voice vote. The substitute added a number of provisions to H.R. 
2941, including the texts of H.R. 2067, H.R. 2065 and portions 
of H.R. 2025. Congressman Bruce Vento (D-MN) also offered and 
withdrew an amendment requiring the NPS to review and revise 
its criteria for housing its employees. The bill, as amended, 
was ordered favorably reported to the Full Committee. On June 
19, 1996, the Full Resources Committee met to consider H.R. 
2941. An amendment to further ensure that employee housing is 
only constructed where essential was offered by Congressman 
George Miller (D-CA) and adopted by voice vote. The bill, as 
amended, was then ordered favorably reported to the House of 
Representatives.

                      Section-by-Section Analysis

              Section 1. Short Title and Table of Contents

    Section 1 provides the short title and table of contents 
for the bill.

        Section 2. National Park Service Housing Improvement Act

    Section 2 provides a comprehensive program to improve the 
overall quality of housing for NPS employees.
    Section 2(a) outlines the purposes of the section. The 
legislation recognizes that provision of quality housing is 
important to the overall success of carrying out the mission of 
the agency. Further, it is clear that the quality of housing 
for agency personnel must be improved and that in a time of 
limited budgets, direct appropriations will not be adequate to 
accomplish the task. Therefore, the Committee supports this 
legislation which provides a range of innovative authorities to 
accomplish the goal of improving agency housing. The Committee 
further notes that one of the most important steps to providing 
a self-sufficient program of quality of employee housing is to 
provide such housing only where absolutely necessary.
    Section 2(b) provides a general authority for the Secretary 
of the Interior to make housing available for NPS employees 
both on and off Federal lands at a reasonable value 
commensurate with comparable housing in the local community.
    Section 2(c) directs the Secretary to review and revise 
criteria under which housing is provided to NPS employees. A 
report to Congress is provided under Section 2(d).
    Section 2(g) authorizes joint public-private sector housing 
programs. Under this authority, the Secretary of the Interior 
is authorized to competitively enter into lease arrangements 
with the private sector to: construct new housing on Federal 
lands, improve existing housing on Federal lands, and to manage 
existing Federal housing, including the maintenance.
    Section 2(h) provides for the Secretary to enter into a 
build to lease program with the private sector. Under this 
authority, the Secretary would be authorized to enter into 
arrangements with the private sector to build housing in return 
for a guaranteed rental income.
    Section 2(k) provides for the sale or lease of employee 
housing, including the lease of underlying lands, to employee 
cooperatives made up exclusively of field NPS employees. The 
Committee believes that this authority has great potential 
benefit for both the Federal Government and agency employees. 
Under such arrangements, the Federal Government would no longer 
be responsible for costs and management of housing, and the 
employees would gain equity and interest by becoming homeowners 
through the employee cooperative. Since this authority does not 
have precedent within the Interior Department, the Committee 
has added a proviso that it cannot be initiated without 
submittal of a report to Congress.
    Section 2(l) provides for the Secretary to lease housing 
for seasonal employees of the NPS. The Committee understands 
that the greatest operational housing deficit exists for 
seasonal quarters, which are only occupied for a portion of the 
year. It appears that such quarters will continue to have a 
financial impact on the viability of the housing program. At 
the same time, the Committee recognizes that because many parks 
are located in resort locations, employees hired during the 
peak season will often be faced with abnormally high quarters 
rates. Therefore, this section authorizes the Secretary to 
provide additional funding to support such housing needs where 
necessary.
    This section also permits the Secretary to rent seasonal 
quarters to non-Federal Government persons when such quarters 
are not needed for Federal Government use. The Committee 
believes that this authority has potential to help offset the 
negative cost flow from seasonal quarters in some locations.
    Section 2(m) requires the Secretary to complete a condition 
assessment for employee housing and to develop a priority list 
for construction and rehabilitation based on this assessment. 
The Committee recognizes that the NPS has already completed 
such an assessment; however, a subsequent analysis by the GAO 
raises serious questions about the validity of that analysis 
(see GAO Report 94-294). Therefore, the Committee strongly 
believes that another analysis is an essential prerequisite to 
ensure that funds are directed to the highest priority 
projects.
    Section 2(n) requires that appropriated funds be allocated 
according to the priority list established under 2(m) ``to the 
maximum extent practicable.'' The Committee is aware that in 
the past funding allocations have been based on geopolitical 
consideration as much as on the basis of need. This is not 
acceptable. The Committee recognizes that in some cases it may 
not be possible to follow the nationwide priority listing, for 
example, if funding for basic infrastructure must be provided 
prior to housing construction, but expects that the priority 
listing will be almost always followed.
    Section 2(o) requires the NPS to show in its annual budget 
justification the amount which the agency intends to spend on 
housing over and above the amount collected in rents. The 
Committee believes that this information will be helpful in 
tracking how large the funding shortfall is in the NPS housing 
program.
    Section 2(p) authorizes the Secretary to provide at cost 
transportation for employees to and from work. This extends the 
authority already available at Carlsbad Caverns National Park 
to other units of the park system. The Committee expects that 
under this legislation, there will be less Federal Government 
employee housing in parks and therefore the inclusion of this 
provision to facilitate commuting is appropriate.
    Section 2(q) directs the Secretary to report to Congress on 
the use of rental subsidies as a partial solution to the 
housing problem facing the NPS. The Committee expects that 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will not support such an 
approach for the NPS, but notes that the Federal Government's 
largest supplier of employee housing, the Defense Department, 
is using this authority effectively. Therefore, the Committee 
has taken the unusual step of requiring the report be submitted 
simultaneously to Congress and OMB for review. Any other 
approach would prevent the Congress from receiving a full 
examination of the topic.
    Section 2(r) enumerates several general provisions of this 
section. Section 2(r)(1) places certain limitations on 
construction of employee housing, specifically that it not 
impact primary park resources and that any housing constructed 
be consistent with the park plans. Such plans meet the 
requirements of public review and compliance with various 
Federal laws. Section 2(r)(2) sets forth the process for 
establishing and adjusting rental rates. Section 2(r)(4) 
clarifies that the Act of July 15, 1968, does not apply with 
regard to leases under this section. That law provides for a 
generic leaseback authority for the agency and is not 
applicable for housing purposes.
    Section 2(s) provides that any funds received from leases 
under this section may be retained by the Secretary of the 
Interior, without appropriation, to assist in off-setting the 
costs of the overall housing program.
    Section 2(t) provides the operational definitions used in 
the section.

              Section 3. Minor Boundary Revision Authority

    This section is intended to address three principle 
problems associated with the current process of enacting such 
legislation: length of time required for Congressional action, 
inconsistencies among parks with respect to authority for 
making minor boundary adjustments, and clarification of exactly 
what is meant by a minor boundary adjustment.
    Section 3 amends section 7(c) of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund Act of 1965 to provide generic minor boundary 
adjustment authority for the NPS. The section also lists 
criteria for determining whether a boundary modification is 
``minor'', including the size of the parcel, its appraised 
value, whether the National Environmental Policy Act is 
triggered, whether public review and comment has occurred and 
written approval of property owners.

  Section 4. Authorization for Certain Park Facilities to be Located 
               Outside Units of the National Park System

    Section 4 provides generic authority to the NPS to 
construct and operate essential visitor and administrative 
facilities outside the boundary of park units on lands acquired 
by the Secretary of the Interior from willing sellers, or on 
lands leased by the Secretary. This authority allows the agency 
to establish joint interagency visitor centers, build employee 
housing in adjacent communities, or locate administrative 
offices in adjacent communities. The legislation requires any 
such action be in conformance with park plans. Such authority 
will improve service to visitors (e.g. by siting visitor 
contact points in the best possible location), improve the 
administration of parks and reduce the potential impact of 
administrative facilities on park resources.
    The section further authorizes the Secretary to enter into 
joint arrangements with State and local governments and others 
to provide for infrastructure development. This authority will 
permit the Secretary to realize cost savings, and to locate 
non-essential utility systems on non-park lands, thereby 
reducing potential impact to park resources.

     Section 5. Elimination of Unnecessary Congressional Reporting 
                              Requirements

    Section 5 eliminates the following reports:
          1. Report on: Proposals for Acquisition of Capital 
        Equipment or Land for National Park System 
        Transportation Projects. The Secretary is authorized to 
        provide transportation alternatives to reduce the use 
        of private vehicles which ``may diminish the natural 
        and recreational value of'' the parks. This report 
        details the acquisition of equipment and/or property to 
        accomplish this task. This information is provided 
        through the budget process.
          2. Report on: Recommended Changes in the List of 
        Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Sites. The 
        Chaco National Historical Park enabling legislation 
        directs the Secretary of the Interior ``to search for 
        additional evidences of Chacoan sites'' and submit 
        recommendations for deletions or additions in a report 
        to Congress. Additions or deletions from this list 
        ``shall be made only by an Act of Congress.'' The 
        report is produced as needed at a cost of approximately 
        $1,500.
          3. Report on: Report on Carrying Capacity for the 
        Isle au Haut Portion of Acadia National Park. The 
        carrying capacities for the Isle au Haut portion of 
        Acadia National Park were established and reported in 
        1984. The requirements have been met.
          4. Report on: Wolf Trap-Filene Center Grant Report. 
        Wolf Trap-Filene Center was given a grant to repair 
        fire damage. The Foundation was required to report to 
        Congress on a quarterly basis concerning the progress 
        and goals on reconstruction. The grant was disbursed 
        and construction has been completed.
          5. Report on: National Trails System Plan. The 
        Secretary of the Interior is to report to Congress 
        biennially on a National Trails System Plan ``in full 
        consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, the 
        Governors of the various States, and the trails 
        community.'' The report is to indicate the extent and 
        scope of a completed nationwide system, including 
        scenic and historic components and other trails that 
        would complete a comprehensive plan. Such a report 
        would be extremely costly to complete and has never 
        been done due to lack of funds.
          6. Report on: Maintenance Management System Progress 
        Report. The NPS was directed to establish a maintenance 
        management program and to report to Congress on the 
        status of the implementation process. The system is now 
        in place.
          7. Report on: National Visitor Center Report. The 
        Secretary of the Interior was directed to report 
        annually to Congress on the status of the National 
        Visitor Center at Union Station Plaza. The Center no 
        longer exists.
          8. Report on: Land and Water Conservation Fund 
        Grants-in-Aid Program Report. This annual report to 
        Congress on each State grant program includes a 
        description of the projects and the estimated cost of 
        completion.
          9. Report on: National Park Service Plan. This annual 
        report is used as a guide to identify natural and 
        historic themes of the United States, from which areas 
        can be selected for future park units. The report costs 
        approximately $100,000 to produce. Due to staff and 
        financial restraints, the report is done approximately 
        every five years.
          10. Report on: Appalachian Trail Report. This annual 
        report lists land acquired and estimated to be acquired 
        for the Appalachian Trail. Report also includes land 
        planned for acquisition and cost for the coming fiscal 
        year.
          11. Report on: Delaware Water Gap National Recreation 
        Area Commission. This annual report by the Citizen 
        Advisory Commission documents its findings and 
        conclusions along with recommendations on legislation 
        and administrative actions it considers appropriate. 
        The cost of the report is approximately $10,000.
          12. Report on: Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage 
        Preservation Commission Report. This annual report by 
        the Commission specifies the amount, recipient, and 
        purpose of any loan, grant, or technical assistance 
        provided and an analysis of actions taken during the 
        previous year to preserve the resources of the area.
          13. Report on: Innovation Grants for Urban Parks and 
        Recreation. This annual report outlines the 
        achievements of the urban park innovation grant 
        program, ``with emphasis on the nationwide implications 
        of successful innovation projects.'' The report costs 
        approximately $3,400 to prepare.
          14. Report on: Youth Conservation Corps Report. This 
        annual joint report of the Secretary of the Interior 
        and the Secretary of Agriculture details the activities 
        of the Youth Conservation Corps program and 
        recommendations.
          15. Report on: Notification Setting Forth Reasons for 
        Making a Historic Preservation Act Regulation Effective 
        Prior to Expiration of 30-Day Period In an emergency 
        case, the Secretary of the Interior must notify 
        Congress of reasons for making a final regulation 
        effective prior to the end of the 30-day comment period 
        following publication in the Federal Register.
          16. Report on: Archeological Resources Protection 
        Report. Congress authorized the establishment of 
        archeological resources protection programs to protect 
        and increase awareness of such resources located on 
        ``public lands and Indian lands.'' A report regarding 
        the actions taken under these programs is to be 
        submitted annually. This report costs NPS approximately 
        $38,000 plus Field Area costs.
          17. Report on: Archaeological Resources Protection 
        Report Annual. This annual report outlines the scope 
        and effectiveness of historical and archaeological data 
        preservation programs, indicating the projects 
        surveyed, results, and costs incurred.
          18. Report on: Notice of Expenditure Exceeding 
        $1,000,000 for Acquisition of Land, Waters, or 
        Interests Therein. This report under the Land and Water 
        Conservation Act provides notification of an 
        expenditure exceeding $1 million or more for land 
        acquisition. This notification is accomplished through 
        the budget process.
          19. Report on: Petroglyph National Monument Report. 
        This report on status of expansion agreement, costs, 
        and proposed alterations to the Petroglyph National 
        Monument Expansion Agreement is to be submitted at 
        five-year intervals beginning in 1993.
          20. Report on: National Historic Preservation Act 
        Proposed and Final Regulations Notice. The proposed and 
        final regulations under the National Historic 
        Preservation Act must be transmitted to the Committee 
        prior to their publication in the Federal Register.
          21. Report on: National Historic Landmark Boundary 
        Changes Report. Boundaries for National Historic 
        Landmark districts ``for which no boundaries have been 
        established'' must be reported to Congress and 
        published in the Federal Register.

  section 6. senate confirmation of the director of the national park 
                                service

    Section 6 provides for the Senate confirmation of the 
Director of the NPS. This language provides for the appointment 
of the Director of the NPS in a manner similar to the other 
land management agencies within the Interior Department (Bureau 
of Land Management and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service). The 
bill also provides for the Director to have professional 
qualifications and experience for the position to avoid a 
succession of directors who spend a substantial portion of 
their tenure getting to know the agency. This is particularly 
critical in an agency as decentralized as the NPS. To more 
effectively represent the various NPS constituencies, the 
legislation provides for the establishment of two deputy 
directors: the first to focus on operation of the park system 
and the second to focus on other program responsibilities of 
the agency.

      section 7. national park system advisory board authorization

    Section 7 provides for the reauthorization of the National 
Park System Advisory Board. The statutory authorization for 
this board expired a year ago, and the importance of the board 
is reflected in the fact that it has been reconstituted 
administratively. Over the years, this board has proven useful 
to the Director of the NPS and the Secretary of the Interior in 
addressing complex and controversial issues facing the agency.
    The legislation requires that the board be comprised of 
persons representing each of the geographic regions of the park 
system and also specifies certain areas of expertise which 
board Members must possess. The board is authorized for a 10-
year period at a cost not to exceed $200,000 per year.

          section 8. challenge cost-share agreement authority

    Section 8 provides broad authority for the Secretary of the 
Interior to enter into challenge cost-share agreements for 
carrying out the purposes of the mission of the NPS. Annual 
Department of the Interior appropriation acts have specified 
ceilings for the use of this authority over the last several 
years. The results of this program have been very effective. In 
a time of limited Federal dollars, this authority is needed to 
permit the leverage of limited Federal dollars. The Committee 
believes that this authority should be expanded to all program 
areas of the agency.

     Section 9. Cost Recovery for Damage to National Park Resources

    Section 9 amends Public Law 101-337 to permit the NPS to 
recover costs for harm to terrestrial resources in the same 
manner that the underlying law permits the agency to recover 
costs for marine resources.

            Committee Oversight Findings and Recommendations

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and clause 
2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives 
the Committee on Resources' oversight findings and 
recommendations are reflected in the body of this report.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that the 
enactment of H.R. 2941 will have no significant inflationary 
impact on prices and costs in the operation of the national 
economy.

                        Cost of the Legislation

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires an estimate and a comparison by the 
Committee of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out 
H.R. 2941. However, clause 7(d) of that rule provides that this 
requirement does not apply when the Committee has included in 
its report a timely submitted cost estimate of the bill 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                     Compliance With House Rule XI

    1. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(B) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, H.R. 
2941 does not contain any new credit authority, or an increase 
or decrease in tax expenditures. The bill as reported does 
contain new budget and spending authority.
    2. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(D) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee has received no report of oversight findings and 
recommendations from the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight on the subject of H.R. 2941.
    3. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(C) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the 
Committee has received the following cost estimate for H.R. 
2941 from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2941, the National 
Park Service Administrative Reform Act of 1996.
    Enacting H.R. 2941 would affect direct spending. Therefore, 
pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.
    Enclosure.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: H.R. 2941.
    2. Bill title: The National Park Service Administrative 
Reform Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Resources on June 19, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: To address funding shortages and other 
difficulties faced by the National Park Service (NPS) in 
carrying out its employee housing program, section 2 of H.R. 
2941 would provide the agency with extensive new authorities, 
including:
          The authority to lease Federal land (for up to 50 
        years) to a contractor, who would construct employee 
        quarters and other essential amenities (such as day 
        care and recreational facilities) in exchange for 
        employee rental payments and a Federal guarantee of a 
        97 percent occupancy rate;
          The authority to rent non-Federal land or buildings 
        for constructing and/or using as employee quarters;
          The authority to provide funds or in-kind 
        contributions to reduce a contractor's costs of 
        planning, construction or rehabilitation;
          The authority to enter into contracts of unspecified 
        lengths with companies to manage, repair, and/or 
        maintain employee housing;
          The authority to sell to employees housing located on 
        Federal lands or to lease Federal land to employees for 
        the purpose of building homes;
          The authority to lease quarters near park units for 
        seasonal employees (if this would be less expensive 
        than constructing quarters) and charge reasonable rents 
        that may be less than the costs of providing the 
        quarters; and
          The authority to retain and spend any proceeds from 
        the sale or lease of Federal land or quarters 
        authorized by this legislation.
    In addition, section 2 would establish new statutory 
criteria for determining when the NPS may provide housing (such 
as the affordability of ``suitable'' local housing) and would 
specifically authorize the agency to provide housing and a 
number of other amenities such as daycare to not only Federal 
employees but also park volunteers, concessionaire workers, and 
others.
    Finally, this section would direct the Secretary of the 
Interior to establish the rental rates for all quarters 
occupied by field employees, including those constructed, 
owned, and/or managed by non-Federal entities. Annual increases 
in such rates could not exceed the Consumer Price Index 
Residential Rent Series adjustment factor.
    Other sections of H.R. 2941 would amend the authority of 
the NPS to make minor adjustments to the boundaries of park 
units, require Senate confirmation of the appointment of the 
director of the NPS, and repeal certain unnecessary reporting 
requirements.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The most 
significant budgetary impact of enacting H.R. 2941 would stem 
from section 2, which would authorize new methods of providing 
housing to Federal employees and other persons who work in 
national park units. CBO believes that the broad contracting 
authorities created by this section could increase Federal 
direct spending by $300 million to $500 million over the next 
five years. While it is likely that some of the money spent 
under these new authorities will be spent in the absence of any 
legislation, such spending would be subject to appropriation 
under existing law and would probably be spread out over a 
greater number of years. Moreover, enacting the bill could 
increase the total costs of providing employee housing by 
removing the housing program from the constraints of the 
appropriations process and by broadening the scope of the 
program. Many provisions of section 2 could make some 
individual housing projects more expensive and some cheaper, 
but the net effect of such provisions is uncertain.

                               section 2

    The provisions of section 2 would affect all activities and 
transactions associated with providing employee housing, 
including: (1) capital projects such as major rehabilitation of 
existing quarters and construction of new housing units, (2) 
annual management and maintenance of employee quarters, and (3) 
offsetting receipts from rental charges to employees.
    Capital Projects.--CBO estimates that the NPS will need 
significant new funding in the near future to address its 
current backlog of housing repair, rehabilitation,and 
replacement needs. Moreover, the agency will probably need 
additional amounts to expand the existing housing stock at 
larger parks, particularly in the west, in order to address 
long-standing housing shortages as well as future needs created 
by the agency's current efforts to relocate central office 
personnel to the field. The costs of this undertaking are very 
uncertain, but we believe that the agency will probably need 
about $500 million over the next five years if it is to avoid 
further deterioration of its housing stock and alleviate severe 
housing shortages at some parks.
    The NPS is already authorized to rehabilitate or construct 
employee housing under current law, but H.R. 2941 would provide 
new options for financing housing projects. In addition, the 
bill could cause the NPS to expand its housing program by 
allowing the agency to provide employee quarters outside of 
park boundaries and by specifically permitting the agency to 
consider the affordability of local private housing and any 
other factors it deems appropriate.
    H.R. 2941 would provide a means of meeting housing needs 
through the use of direct spending authority. Hence, the major 
effect of implementing section 2 on the Federal budget would be 
to exempt construction costs that are currently subject to the 
appropriations from having to go through that process, thereby 
creating new mandatory spending. For example, the bill's lease-
to-build provisions would change the budgetary treatment of 
some capital project expenditures, all of which are currently 
funded through appropriations to the NPS construction account. 
Projects funded under the bill's provisions would be accounted 
for as either lease-purchases or capital leases, as 
appropriate. Under the budget scorekeeping rules required by 
the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, all associated costs of 
such projects, including any upfront cash contributions to the 
contractor, would be treated as either borrowing authority or 
contract authority, respectively. CBO believes that relatively 
few park units--for example, large parks such as Yellowstone or 
Yosemite that are planning large-scale housing projects--would 
be able to take advantage of the bill's new financing 
authorities; therefore, not all of the agency's future 
construction costs would result in new mandatory spending.
    Annual Operating and Maintenance of Quarters.--Section 2 
also would authorize the NPS to enter into contracts with a 
private entity to manage and maintain park housing. Such 
operating contracts would not be subject to appropriation and 
could be of any length. If implemented, this authority would 
increase mandatory spending, but there is no basis for 
estimating such costs.
    At present, about one-half of all expenses associated with 
operating and maintaining employee quarters are funded by 
rental charges. Offsetting receipts from employee rents 
(currently about $12 million annually) are deposited to a 
special fund in the U.S. Treasury and may be spent without 
appropriation. Because rental rates have never been sufficient 
to cover the costs of the housing program, the agency uses 
appropriations to its operating account to fund cyclical 
maintenance and repairs. As a result of recent budget 
constraints, the agency has delayed many of these activities, 
resulting in significant deterioration of many housing units. 
By using the contract authority that would be provided by 
section 2, the NPS would be able to circumvent the 
appropriations process and fund the full costs of maintaining 
employee housing at some or all parks. The costs of performing 
some of these activities would be higher under the contractor 
than if done by park employees. In addition, the NPS would have 
to pay a management fee.
    Employee Rental Receipts.--Section 2 would require the 
Secretary of the Interior to establish all rental rates charged 
to employees. The bill would limit annual rate increases to the 
CPI, which would severely constrain the NPS from phasing in 
much-needed increases. Currently, employee rents are well below 
market rates--often by as much as 60 percent--and are already 
insufficient to cover the expenses of operating the housing 
program. If the agency is not permitted to implement planned 
increases, rentals receipts (and associated direct spending) 
would be lower than under existing law. The resulting shortfall 
would have to be funded through either discretionary 
appropriations or higher payments to a management contractor. 
For parks where such contracts would be impractical, the 
housing stock would continue to deteriorate, resulting in even 
greater future costs to rehabilitate or replace dilapidated 
units.
    Other Effects on Direct Spending.--Section 2 also would 
permit the NPS to retain and spend without appropriation any 
amounts earned from leases or sales of land or quarters. 
Implementing this provision for proceeds related to leasing 
activities would have no net impact on the federal budget 
because the NPS is already authorized to spend proceeds from 
leasing of living quarters to employees, and the receipt and 
spending of proceeds from leasing federal lands would offset 
each other. However, spending of proceeds from sales to 
employees would result in a net cost for pay-as-you-go purposes 
because the sale of employee housing would be considered an 
asset sale under provisions of the Balanced Budget Act. As 
such, the sale receipts would not be counted under the pay-as-
you-go requirements, while the expenditure of amounts collected 
from such sales would increase direct spending. CBO expects 
that the amounts collected from such sales would be small, 
however, because in most cases the NPS would be reluctant to 
sell housing, and employees would be unable to buy it. Thus, we 
expect that the amount of any asset sales and associated direct 
spending would be less than $500,000 in any given fiscal year.

                             OTHER SECTIONS

    Section 4 of the bill, which would authorize the NPS to 
lease private lands in the vicinity of a park and to construct 
thereon essential park facilities, could also result in new 
mandatory budget authority and outlays, but CBO has no basis 
for estimating such spending.
    Section 9 of the bill also would affect direct spending by 
allowing the NPS to retain and spend amounts recovered from 
those who damage certain park resources. Such amounts, which 
are usually insignificant, are currently deposited to the 
general fund of the U.S. Treasury.
    6. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets 
up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct 
spending or receipts through 1998. CBO estimates that enacting 
H.R. 2941 would affect direct spending. Such spending could 
total $300 million to $500 million over the next five years.
    7. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: H.R. 2941 contains no intergovernmental mandates 
as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public 
Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on State, local, or tribal 
governments.
    8. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would 
impose no new Federal private-sector mandates as defined in 
Public Law 104-4.
    9. Previous CBO estimate: None.
    10. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Deborah 
Reis. Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Marjorie 
Miller. Impact on the Private Sector: Patrice Gordon.
    11. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant 
Director for Budget Analysis.

    H.R. 2941 contains no unfunded mandates.

    (c) Boundary Changes: Donations.--Whenever the Secretary of 
the Interior determines that to do so will contribute to, and 
is necessary for, the proper preservation, protection, 
interpretation, or management of an area of the national park 
system, he may, following timely notice in writing to the 
[Committee on Natural] Committee on Resources of the House of 
Representatives and to the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources of the Senate of his intention to do so, and by 
publication of a revised boundary map or other description in 
the Federal Register, (i) make minor revisions of the boundary 
of the area, and moneys appropriated from the fund shall be 
available for acquisition of any lands, waters, and interests 
therein added to the area by such boundary revision subject to 
such statutory limitations, if any, on methods of acquisition 
and appropriations thereof as may be specifically applicable to 
such area[: Provided, however, That such authority shall apply 
only to those boundaries established subsequent to January 1, 
1965]; and (ii) acquire by donation, purchase with donated 
funds, transfer from any other Federal agency, or exchange, 
lands, waters, or interests therein adjacent to such area, 
except that in exercising his authority under this clause (ii) 
the Secretary may not alienate property administered as part of 
the national park system in order to acquire lands by exchange, 
the Secretary may not acquire property without the consent of 
the owner, and the Secretary may acquire property owned by a 
State or political subdivision thereof only by donation. In all 
cases except the case of technical boundary revisions 
(resulting from such causes as survey error or changed road 
alignments), the authority of the Secretary under clause (i) 
shall apply only if each of the following conditions is met:
          (1) The sum of the total acreage of lands, waters, 
        and interests therein to be added to the area and the 
        total such acreage to be deleted from the area is not 
        more than 5 percent of the total Federal acreage 
        authorized to be included in the area and is less than 
        200 acres in size.
          (2) The acquisition, if any, is not a major Federal 
        action significantly affecting the quality of the human 
        environment, as determined by the Secretary.
          (3) The sum of the total appraised value of the 
        lands, water, and interest therein to be added to the 
        area and the total appraised value of the lands, 
        waters, and interests therein to be deleted from the 
        area does not exceed $750,000.
          (4) The proposed boundary revision is not an element 
        of a more comprehensive boundary modification proposal.
          (5) The proposed boundary has been subject to a 
        public review and comment period.
          (6) The Director of the National Park Service obtains 
        written support for the boundary modification from all 
        property owners whose lands, water, or interests 
        therein, or a portion of whose lands, water, or 
        interests therein, will be added to or deleted from the 
        area by the boundary modification.
        Minor boundary revisions involving only deletions of 
        acreage owned by the Federal Government and 
        administered by the National Park Service may be made 
        only by Act of Congress. Prior to making a 
        determination under this subsection, the Secretary 
        shall consult with the duly elected governing body of 
        the county, city, town, or other jurisdiction or 
        jurisdictions having primary taxing authority over the 
        land or interest to be acquired as to the impacts of 
        such proposed action, and he shall also take such steps 
        as he may deem appropriate to advance local public 
        awareness of the proposed action. Lands, waters and 
        interests therein acquired in accordance with this 
        subsection shall be administered as part of the area to 
        which they are added, subject to the laws and 
        regulations applicable thereto.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR PARK FACILITIES OUTSIDE BOUNDARIES OF SYSTEM 
                    UNITS.

  (a) Authority.--In order to facilitate the administration of 
the national park system, the Secretary of the Interior is 
authorized, under such terms and conditions as he may deem 
advisable, to establish essential facilities for park 
administration, visitor use, and park employee residential 
housing outside the boundaries, but within the vicinity, of 
units of the national park system for purposes of assuring 
conservation, visitor use, and proper management of such units. 
Such facilities, and the use thereof, shall be in conformity 
with approved plans for the unit concerned. The Secretary shall 
use existing facilities wherever feasible. Such facilities may 
only be constructed by the Secretary upon finding that location 
of such facilities would--
          (1) avoid undue degradation of the primary natural or 
        cultural resources within the unit;
          (2) enhance service to the public; or
          (3) provide a cost saving to the Federal Government.
  (b) Agreements, Leases, Guidelines, and Construction.--For 
the purpose of establishing facilities under subsection (a):
          (1) The Secretary may enter into agreements 
        permitting the Secretary to use for such purposes those 
        Federal lands that the head of a Federal agency having 
        primary authority over the administration of such land 
        and the Secretary determine to be suitable for such 
        use.
          (2) The Secretary, under such terms and conditions as 
        the Secretary determines are reasonable, may lease or 
        acquire (from willing sellers only) by purchase or 
        donation, real property (other than Federal land), for 
        the purposes specified in this section.
          (3) For real property acquired pursuant to paragraph 
        (2), the Secretary shall establish written guidelines 
        setting forth criteria to be used in determining 
        whether the acquisition would--
                  (A) reflect unfavorably upon the ability of 
                the Department or an employee to carry out its 
                responsibilities or official duties in a fair 
                and objective manner; or
                  (B) compromise the integrity, or the 
                appearance of integrity, of the Department's 
                programs or of any official involved in those 
                programs.
          (4) The Secretary may construct, operate, and 
        maintain such permanent and temporary buildings and 
        facilities as the Secretary deems appropriate on land 
        which is in the vicinity of any unit of the national 
        park system for which the Secretary has acquired 
        authority under this section, except that the Secretary 
        may not begin construction, operation, or maintenance 
        of buildings or facilities on land not owned by the 
        United States until the owner of such lands has entered 
        into a binding agreement with the Secretary, the terms 
        of which assure the continued use of such buildings and 
        facilities for a period of time commensurate with the 
        level of Federal investment.
  (c) Cooperative Agreements and Joint Ventures for 
Infrastructure Facilities.--The Secretary is authorized to 
enter into cooperative agreements or joint ventures with local 
or State governmental agencies, other Federal agencies, Indian 
Tribes, and private entities either on or off the lands subject 
to the jurisdiction of the Secretary, to provide appropriate 
and necessary utility and other infrastructure facilities in 
support of park administration, visitor use, and park employee 
residential housing.

Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources,
1324 Longworth HOB, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for advising the Committee on 
Agriculture that on June 19, 1996, the Committee on Resources 
had ordered reported H.R. 2941, a bill whose original purpose 
was to improve the quantity and quality of the quarters of land 
management agency field employees. This Committee received an 
original additional referral of the bill.
    Inasmuch as the draft report to accompany H.R. 2941, 
contained in your letter of June 19, 1996, indicates that the 
Committee on Resources had deleted references to living 
quarters for National Forest Service employees and restricts 
the effect of the bill as reported only to the National Park 
Services, the Committee on Agriculture wishes to waive further 
consideration of this bill and withdraw any objections to it 
consideration on the House Floor next week.
    However, our waiver on consideration of H.R. 2941 should 
not be considered as precedent for any future referrals of 
similar measures relating to provisions in H.R. 2941 as
