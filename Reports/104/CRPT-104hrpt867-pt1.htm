SEC. 3. RECOMMENDATION OF FUNDING MEASURES.

  Not later than 1 year after the date of the submission of the first 
report submitted under section 35(h)(1) of the Organic Act of Guam (as 
added by section 2 of this Act), the President shall submit to the 
Congress a list of recommended spending cuts or other measures which, 
if implemented, would generate sufficient savings or income, during the 
first 5 fiscal years beginning after the date of the submission of such 
list, to provide the amount of compensation necessary to fully carry 
out this section (as determined in such first report).

                          Purpose of the Bill

    The purpose of H.R. 2041 is to amend the Organic Act of 
Guam to prove restitution to the people of Guam who suffered 
atrocities such as personal injury, forced labor, forced 
marches, internment, and death during the occupation of Guam in 
World War II.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

    The island of Guam together with nearby islets and cays 
constitute the southernmost islands of the Mariana Archipelago 
in the far Western Pacific. United States sovereignty over Guam 
was established pursuant to the Treaty of Paris which ended the 
Spanish-American War in 1898. Residents of the islands became 
United States nationals and later after World War II, U.S. 
citizens.
    The U.S. Navy was administering Guam when Japanese forces 
invaded the territory on December 10, 1941. For 32 months, the 
people of Guam suffered atrocities by the enemy occupation, 
including executions, rapes, beatings, imprisonment, forced 
labor and forced marches, primarily due to their continued 
loyalty to the United States.
    Finally, on July 21, 1944, U.S. forces liberated the 
islands. The people of Guam endured the grim hostilities 
centered in the Western Pacific during the balance of World War 
II with their fellow Americans back in control. V-J Day in 
August and the Armistice in September 1945, appeared to be the 
beginning of reconciling the personal injuries inflicted upon 
the people of Guam by the Japanese enemy forces.
    The United States signed a Treaty of Peace with Japan on 
September 8, 1951, which precludes American citizens from 
making claims against Japan for war reparations. With direct 
reparations from Japan legally foreclosed, the people of Guam 
had no choice but to look to Washington for redress of their 
war time losses. While civilians and prisoners of war, both 
American nationals and citizens, have been awarded some 
compensation from the federal government during the latter part 
of World War II and the post war period, only the Americans of 
Guam have never had their loyalty and suffering of World War II 
fully recognized and claims remedied.
    In 1945 Congress passed the Guam Meritorious Claims Act, 
Public Law 79-224, authorizing payment of Guam's war claims. 
Questions arose regarding the administration of the Guam claims 
by the Naval government on Guam. Claims over $5,000 were 
discouraged because these amounts would require approval from 
Washington. The Naval claims administrators relied heavily on 
property damage as opposed to death or personal injury as the 
basis of claims, which resulted in some cases of greater 
compensation being paid for the loss of trees than for the loss 
of a human limb. These procedural shortcomings were compounded 
by the oversight of the underlying law which did not authorize 
payment for claims based on forced labor or forced march, even 
though American civilians in the Philippines were paid for 
these categories.
    The Secretary of the Interior appointed the Hopkins 
Commission in 1945 to examine the handling of the Naval claims 
process. The Commission recommended changes in the Guam 
Meritorious Claims Act to address a number of serious 
shortcomings. A major problem was the one year limit for claims 
to be submitted. It was well known that due to the destruction 
and displacement of entire villages, one year was insufficient 
time for people who were struggling with recovering from years 
of war time occupation and strife. The Commission emphasized 
the loyalty of the people of Guam during the brutal occupation.
    The most distant U.S. territory, Guam, was not included in 
acts of Congress in 1948 and 1962 to address some of the 
lingering problems arising from the initial efforts to settle 
war claims by American nationals and citizens. This oversight 
left outstanding the deficiencies in the Guam Meritorious 
Claims Act reported by the Interior Department's Hopkins 
Commission.
    Americans in Guam who remained loyal to the United States 
throughout the conflict of World War II and their descendants 
are still waiting for a just and final recognition of their 
loyalty and resolution of reparations. Congressional action is 
necessary to bring these issues to closure.
    For the people of Guam, war reparations is an issue that 
demands attention, especially during the 50th anniversary 
observances of the Liberation of Guam and the end of the War in 
the Pacific. Every single person on Guam of Chamorro ancestry 
has a close relative who experienced the atrocities of the war.

                            Committee Action

    Congressman Elton Gallegly (R-CA) introduced H.R. 602, of 
which title V was the ``Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition 
Act,'' on January 20, 1995. The Subcommittee on Native American 
and Insular Affairs held a hearing on January 31, 1995, on H.R. 
602. The legislation was modified and reintroduced as H.R. 2041 
on July 13, 1995, by Delegate Robert A. Underwood (D-GU). The 
bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Resources and 
in addition to the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee 
on International Relations. Within the Committee on Resources, 
the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Native American 
and Insular Affairs. On July 24, 1996, the Subcommittee held a 
hearing during which discussion was raised regarding pending 
legislation on Guam war restitution. On September 18, 1996, the 
Subcommittee was discharged from further consideration of H.R. 
2041 and the Full Committee met to consider the measure. 
Delegate Underwood offered an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute which would require the President to recommend 
spending cuts or other cost saving measures to fund the Act, 
instead of collecting a fee from the sale of military supplies 
to Japan; it was adopted by voice vote. The bill, as amended, 
was then ordered favorably reported to the House of 
Representatives by voice vote.

                      Section-by-Section Analysis

Section 1. Short Title

    The Act is to be cited as the ``Guam Restitution Act''

Section 2. Amendment to Organic Act of Guam to Provide Restitution

    This section amends the Organic Act of Guam (48 U.S.C. 1421 
et seq.) by adding at the end of the Act a new section 
entitled, ``Recognition of demonstrated loyalty of Guam to 
United States, and suffering and deprivation arising therefrom, 
during World War II''. This new section includes definitions of 
the terms ``award,'' ``benefit'', ``commission'', ``compensable 
injury'', ``Guamanian'', ``proof'', and ``Trust Fund''.
    This new section of the Organic Act outlines the 
requirements for claims and general duties of the Guam Trust 
Fund Commission, the criteria a claimant must meet to be 
eligible for an award, as well as conditions under which such 
awards shall be paid.
    A Guam Trust Fund is established, to be disbursed by the 
Guam Trust Fund Commission, also established by this 
legislation. The Commission is required to submit a report to 
Congress, the President, and the Governor of Guam within a year 
after the Commission is formed, and annually afterwards, 
including a final report after the benefits have been paid.
    This section also provides limitations on agent and 
attorney's fees, disclaimers, and an authorization of 
appropriations.

Section 3. Recommendation of Funding Measures

    Under this section, within a year after the submission of 
the Commission's first report, the President of the United 
States must submit to Congress a list of measures intended to 
generate savings or income necessary to carry out H.R. 2041.

            Committee Oversight Findings and Recommendations

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and clause 
2(b)(1) of Rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
the Committee on Resources' oversight findings and 
recommendations are reflected in the body of this report.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that the 
enactment of H.R. 2041 will have no significant inflationary 
impact on prices and costs in the operation of the national 
economy.

                        Cost of the Legislation

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires an estimate and a comparison by the 
Committee of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out 
H.R. 2041. However, clause 7(d) of that Rule provides that this 
requirement does not apply when the Committee has included in 
its report a timely submitted cost estimate of the bill 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                     Compliance With House Rule XI

    1. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(B) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, H.R. 
2041 does not contain any new budget authority, credit 
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax 
expenditures.
    2. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(D) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee has received no report of oversight findings and 
recommendations from the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight on the subject of H.R. 2041.
    3. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(C) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the 
Committee has received the following cost estimate for H.R. 
2041 from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                  Washington, DC, October 10, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources, House of Representatives, Washington, 
        DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 2041, the Guam War Restitution Act, as ordered 
reported by the House Committee on Resources on September 18, 
1996. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2041 would increase 
direct spending by between $50 million and $100 million over 
the next several years to compensate Guamanians injured during 
the occupation of Guam by Japan in World War II. Even though 
the bill would authorize the appropriation of funds to pay for 
such claims, it entitles eligible individuals to receive 
compensation. Therefore, CBO concludes that those payments 
would constitute mandatory spending in the form of an 
appropriated entitlement, and pay-as-you-go procedures would 
apply. In addition, CBO estimates that discretionary costs 
would increase by about $3 million over the same period to 
establish a commission to certify and pay eligible claims.

Bill purpose

    H.R. 2041 would establish procedures for compensating 
Guamanians who either directly suffered injury during the 
Japanese occupation of Guam in World War II, or are related to 
a deceased individual who was killed or injured during the 
occupation. Specifically, the bill would award $20,000 for a 
claim based on death, $7,000 for a claim based on personal 
injury, and $5,000 for a claim based on forced labor, forced 
march, or internment. For the latter two claims, cash would be 
awarded to individuals who directly suffered the injury, and 
benefits--such as a scholarship or the payment of medical 
expenses--would be awarded to the relatives of a deceased 
individual injured during the occupation.
    The bill would establish a nine-member Guam Trust Fund 
Commission to certify eligibility and award compensation. The 
President would appoint the members based on recommendations 
made by the Governor of Guam. Costs of the commission would be 
paid from either donated or appropriated funds. Claimants would 
have 12 months from the date the ninth commissioner is 
appointed to file their claims, and the commission would have 
12 months to certify each new claim. At the earlier of six 
years or the awarding of the final claim, the bill would 
terminate the commission and require that it transfer any 
remaining funds to the University of Guam.

Federal Budgetary Impact

    CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2041 would increase direct 
spending by the federal government by between $50 million and 
$100 million over the next several years. The range results 
from differing estimates of the number of valid claims that 
would likely be submitted if the bill is enacted. The high end 
of the range assumes that about 15,000 claims would be 
submitted. (Approximately 13,000 names are inscribed on a wall 
memorializing Guamanians who died or suffered an atrocity 
during the period of the Japanese occupation, but the 
possibility of compensation from the federal government might 
elicit additional claims.) The low end is based on the 
approximately 9,000 claims previously submitted to the 
governor's office on Guam and also excludes the approximately 
$8 million previously paid to Guamanians under the Guam 
Meritorious Claims Act (Public Law 79-224). (It is uncertain 
whether adequate records remain to determine who previously 
received compensation.) Depending on when the Congress would 
appropriate the necessary funds, full payments of the awards 
and benefits could take several years.
    In addition, CBO estimates that the commission would incur 
discretionary costs of about $3 million over the next several 
years to process claims.

Mandates statement

    H.R. 2041 contains no private-sector or intergovernmental 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local, 
or tribal governments. The bill provides that any amounts 
remaining in the Guam Trust Fund after termination of the 
commission would be given to the University of Guam for 
scholarships. CBO cannot predict whether any such amounts would 
be available.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are John R. 
Righter (for federal costs), and Marjorie Miller (for state and

                reason therefor.
          (2) Annual operations and status of trust fund.--
        Beginning with the first full fiscal year ending after 
        submission of the first report required by paragraph 
        (1), and annually thereafter with respect to each 
        fiscal year in which the Commission is in existence, 
        the Commission shall submit a report to Congress, the 
        President, and the Governor of Guam concerning the 
        operations of the Commission under this section and the 
        status of the Trust Fund. Each such report shall be 
        submitted not later than January 15th of the first 
        calendar year beginning after the end of the fiscal 
        year which the report concerns.
          (3) Final award report.--After all awards have been

                awards under this section, broken down by 
                category of compensable injury; and
                  (B) the status of the Trust Fund and the

States Code, or imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both.
  (j) Disclaimer.--No provision of this section shall 
constitute an obligation for the United States to pay any claim 
arising out of war. The compensation provided in this section 
is ex gratia in nature and intended solely as a means of 
recognizing the demonstrated loyalty of the people of Guam to 
the United States, and the suffering and deprivation arising 
therefrom, during World War II.
  (k) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to 
be appropriated, from sums appropriated to the Department of 
the Interior, such sums as may be necessary to carry out this 
section, including the administrative responsibilities of the 
Commission for the 36-month period beginning on the date of the 
appointment of the ninth member of the Commission. Amounts 
appropriated pursuant to this section are authorized to remain 
available until expended.
                            Additional Views

                  H.R. 2041, Guam War Restitution Act

    We are pleased that the House Resources Committee has 
reported to the House H.R. 2041, the Guam War Restitution Act. 
This bill and its accompanying report will serve as a starting 
point from which the 105th Congress can continue to work on 
this important issue.
    Building on the action of the 104th Congress and the bill 
reported by the Subcommittee in the 103rd Congress, we will 
continue to work with the Senate and the Administration to 
forge a compromise bill that can pass in the 105th Congress.
    The last time the Committee issued report on Guam war 
restitution was during the 101st Congress. On July 27, 1989, 
the Subcommittee on Insular and International Affairs of the 
Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs printed the 
transcript of a hearing held on H.R. 2024.
    There are many issues addressed and solved through this 
legislation including the use of a set damage award approach 
for restitution--an approach supported by the Guam Legislature.
    Congress still has other problems to solve and there are 
many issues which need to be worked out with the Senate and the 
Administration. However, we intend to continue to work with the 
Committee in a bipartisan manner to solve each individual issue 
within this complex legislation.
