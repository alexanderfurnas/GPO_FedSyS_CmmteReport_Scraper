                 TITLE I--THE PRESIDIO OF SAN FRANCISCO

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Presidio, located amidst the incomparable 
        scenic splendor of the Golden Gate, is one of America's 
        great natural and historic sites;
            (2) the Presidio is the oldest continuously 
        operated military post in the Nation dating from 1776, 
        and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 
        1962;
            (3) preservation of the cultural and historic 
        integrity of the Presidio for public use recognizes its 
        significant role in the history of the United States;
            (4) the Presidio, in its entirety, is a part of the 
        Golden Gate National Recreation Area, in accordance 
        with Public Law 92-589;
            (5) as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation 
        Area, the Presidio's significant natural, historic, 
        scenic, cultural, and recreational resources must be 
        managed in a manner which is consistent with sound 
        principles of land use planning and management, and 
        which protects the Presidio from development and uses 
        which would destroy the scenic beauty and historic and 
        natural character of the area and cultural and 
        recreational resources;
            (6) removal and/or replacement of some structures 
        within the Presidio must be considered as a management 
        option in the administration of the Presidio; and
            (7) the Presidio will be managed through an 
        innovative public/private partnership that minimizes 
        cost to the United States Treasury and makes efficient 
        use of private sector resources.

SEC. 102. AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SECRETARY OF THE 
                    INTERIOR.

    (a) Interim Authority.--The Secretary of the Interior

are terminable with 30 days notice. Prior to the transfer of 
administrative jurisdiction over any property to the Presidio 
Trust, and notwithstanding section 1341 of title 31 of the 
United States Code, the proceeds from any such lease shall be 
retained by the Secretary and such proceeds shall be available, 
without further appropriation, for the preservation, 
restoration, operation and maintenance, improvement, repair and 
related expenses incurred with respect to Presidio properties. 
The Secretary may adjust the rental charge on any such lease 
for any amounts to be expended by the lessee for preservation, 
maintenance, restoration, improvement, repair and related 
expenses with respect to properties and infrastructure within 
the Presidio.
    (b) Public Information and Interpretation.--The Secretary 
shall be responsible, in cooperation with the Presidio Trust,

        52817) was granted, based on an aliquot parts 
        description which was intended to circumscribe the 
        Hesse survey.
            (3) Since the day of the patent, the Hesse survey 
        has been used continuously by the community of Cuprum 
        and by Adams County, Idaho, as the official townsite 
        plat and basis for conveyance of title within the 
        townsite.
            (4) Recent boundary surveys conducted by the United 
        States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and 
        the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of 
        Land Management, discovered inconsistencies between the 
        official aliquot parts description of the patented 
        Cuprum Townsite and the Hesse survey. Many lots along 
        the south and east boundaries of the townsite are now 
        known to extend onto National Forest System lands 
        outside the townsite.
            (5) It is the determination of Congress that the 
        original intent of the Cuprum Townsite application was 
        to include all the lands described by the Hesse survey.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to amend 
the 1909 Cuprum Townsite patent to include those additional 
lands described by the Hesse survey in addition to other lands 
necessary to provide an administratively acceptable boundary to 
the National Forest System.
    (c) Amendment of Patent.--The 1909 Cuprum Townsite patent 
is hereby amended to include parcels 1 and 2, identified on the 
plat, marked as ``Township 20 North, Range 3 West, Boise 
Meridian, Idaho, Section 10: Proposed Patent Adjustment Cuprum 
Townsite, Idaho'' prepared by Payette N.F.--Land Survey Unit, 
drawn and approved by Tom Betzold, Forest Land Surveyor, on 
April 25, 1995. Such additional lands are hereby conveyed to 
the original patentee, Pitts Ellis, trustee, and Probate Judge 
of Washington County, Idaho, or any successors or assigns in 
interest in accordance with State law. The Secretary of 
Agriculture may correct clerical and typographical errors in 
such plat.
    (d) Survey.--The Federal Government shall survey the 
Federal property lines and mark and post the boundaries 
necessary to implement this section.

                    (B) Additional federally owned lands.--If 
                the non-Federal lands are greater in value than

SEC. 302. ANAKTUVUK PASS LAND EXCHANGE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation 
        Act (94 Stat. 2371), enacted on December 2, 1980, 
        established Gates of the Arctic National Park and 
        Preserve and Gates of the Arctic Wilderness. The 
        village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in the highlands of 
        the central Brooks Range, is virtually surrounded by 
        these national park and wilderness lands and is the 
        only Native village located within the boundary of a 
        National Park System unit in Alaska.
            (2) Unlike most other Alaskan Native communities, 
        the village of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major 
        river, lake, or coastline that can be used as a means 
        of access. The residents of Anaktuvuk Pass have relied 
        increasingly on snow machines in winter and all-terrain 
        vehicles in summer as their primary means of access to 
        pursue caribou and other subsistence resources.
            (3) In a 1983 land exchange agreement, linear 
        easements were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people 
        for use of all-terrain vehicles across certain national 
        park lands, mostly along stream and river banks. These 
        linear easements proved unsatisfactory, because they 
        provided inadequate access to subsistence resources 
        while causing excessive environmental impact from 
        concentrated use.
            (4) The National Park Service and the Nunamiut 
        Corporation initiated discussions in 1985 to address 
        concerns over the use of all-terrain vehicles on park 
        and wilderness land. These discussions resulted in an 
        agreement, originally executed in 1992 and thereafter 
        amended in 1993 and 1994, among the National Park 
        Service, Nunamiut Corporation, the City of Anaktuvuk 
        Pass, and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Full 
        effectuation of this agreement, as amended, by its 
        terms requires ratification by the Congress.
    (b) Ratification of Agreement.--
            (1) Ratification.--
                    (A) In general.--The terms, conditions, 
                procedures, covenants, reservations, and other

                ``Donation, Exchange of Lands and Interests in 
                Lands and Wilderness Redesignation Agreement

                Nunamiut Corporation, City of Anaktuvuk Pass 
                and the United States of America'' (hereinafter 
                referred to in this section as ``the 
                Agreement''), executed by the parties on 
                December 17, 1992, as amended, are hereby 
                incorporated in this title, are ratified and 
                confirmed, and set forth the obligations and 
                commitments of the United States, Arctic Slope 
                Regional Corporation, Nunamiut Corporation and 
                the City of Anaktuvuk Pass, as a matter of 
                Federal law.
                    (B) Land acquisition.--Lands acquired by 
                the United States pursuant to the Agreement 
                shall be administered by the Secretary of the

                ``Secretary'') as part of Gates of the Arctic 
                National Park and Preserve, subject to the laws 
                and regulations applicable thereto.
            (2) Maps.--The maps set forth as Exhibits C1, C2, 
        and D through I to the Agreement depict the lands 
        subject to the conveyances, retention of surface access 
        rights, access easements and all-terrain vehicle

                the Arctic Wilderness is hereby amended with 
                the addition of approximately 56,825 acres as

                73,993 acres as wilderness, thus revising the 
                Gates of the Arctic Wilderness to approximately

            (1) In general.--(A) The Secretary shall enter into 
        negotiations for an agreement or agreements to exchange 
        Federal lands or interests therein which are in the 
        State of Alaska for the Selection Rights.
            (B) If the value of the Federal property to be 
        exchanged is less than the value of the Selection 
        Rights established in subsection (b), and if such 
        Federal property to be exchanged is not generating 
        receipts to the Federal Government in excess of 
        $1,000,000 per year, then the Secretary may exchange 
        the Federal property for that portion of the Selection 
        Rights having a value equal to that of the Federal 
        property. The remaining selection rights shall remain 
        available for additional exchanges.
            (C) For the purposes of any exchange to be 
        consummated under this section, if less than all the 
        selection rights are being exchanged, then the value of 
        the selection rights being exchanged shall be equal to 
        the number of acres of selection rights being exchanged 
        multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
        value of all the selection rights as determined 
        pursuant to subsection (b) hereof and the denominator 
        of which is the total number of acres of selection 
        rights.
            (2) Additional exchanges.--If, after 10 years from 
        the date of the enactment of this section, the 
        Secretary was unable to conclude such exchanges as may 
        be required to acquire all of the selection rights, he 
        shall conclude exchanges for the remaining selection 
        rights for such Federal property as may be identified 
        by Koniag, which property is available for transfer to 
        the administrative jurisdiction of the Secretary under 
        any provision of law and which property, at the time of 
        the proposed transfer to Koniag is not generating 
        receipts to the Federal Government in excess of 
        $1,000,000 per year. The Secretary shall keep Koniag 
        advised in a timely manner as to which properties may 
        be available for such transfer. Upon receipt of such 
        identification by Koniag, the Secretary shall request 
        in a timely manner the transfer of such identified 
        property to the administrative jurisdiction of the 
        Department of the Interior. Such property shall not be 
        subject to the geographic limitations of section 206(b) 
        of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and may 
        be retained by the Secretary solely for purposes of 
        transferring it to Koniag to complete the exchange. 
        Should the value of the property so identified by 
        Koniag be in excess of the value of the remaining 
        selection rights, then Koniag shall have the option of 
        (A) declining to proceed with the exchange and 
        identifying other property, or (B) paying the 
        difference in value between the property rights.
    (d) Certain Conveyances.--
            (1) Interests in land.--For the purposes of section 
        21(c) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
        U.S.C. 1620(e)), the receipt of consideration, 
        including, but not limited to, lands, cash or other 
        property, by a Native Corporation for the 
        relinquishment to the United States of land selection 
        rights granted to any Native Corporation under such Act 
        shall be deemed to be an interest in land.
            (2) Authority to appoint and remove trustee.--In 
        establishing a Settlement Trust under section 39 of 
        such Act (43 U.S.C. 1629c), Koniag may delegate, in

        subsection (b)(2) of such section to any entity that 
        Koniag may select without affecting the status of the 
        trust as a Settlement Trust under such section.

        approval no later than 120 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, and the Secretary shall make a

        dispute and a final determination of value shall be 
        resolved through a process of bargaining or submission 
        to arbitration in accordance with section 206(d) of the 
        Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43

                    (i) value the land in its unimproved state, 
                as a single entity for its highest and best use 
                as if in private ownership and as of the date 
                of enactment of this Act;
                    (ii) consider the Federal lands as an 
                independent property as though in the private 
                marketplace and suitable for development to its 
                highest and best use;
                    (iii) consider in the appraisal any 
                encumbrance on the title anticipated to be in 
                the conveyance to Sun Valley Company and 
                reflect its effect on the fair market value of 
                the property; and
                    (iv) not reflect any enhancement in value 
                to the Federal selected lands based on the 
                existence of private lands owned by the Sun 
                Valley Company in the vicinity of the Snowbasin 
                Ski Resort, and shall assume that private lands 
                owned by the Sun Valley Company are not 
                available for use in conjunction with the 
                Federal selected lands.
    (d) General Provisions Relating to the Exchange.--
            (1) In general.--The exchange authorized by this 
        section shall be subject to the following terms and 
        conditions:
                    (A) Reserved rights-of-way.--In any deed 
                issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1), the 
                Secretary shall reserve in the United States a 
                right of reasonable access across the conveyed 
                property for public access and for 
                administrative purposes of the United States 
                necessary to manage adjacent federally-owned 
                lands. The terms of such reservation shall be 
                prescribed by the Secretary within 30 days 
                after the date of the enactment of this Act.
                    (B) Right of rescission.--This section 
                shall not be binding on either the United 
                States or the Sun Valley Company if, within 30 
                days after the final determination of value of 
                the Federal selected lands, the Sun Valley 
                Company submits to the Secretary a duly 
                authorized and executed resolution of the 
                Company stating its intention not to enter into 
                the exchange authorized by this section.
            (2) Withdrawal.--Subject to valid existing rights, 
        effective on the date of enactment of this Act, the 
        Federal selected lands described in subsection (c)(1) 
        and all National Forest System lands currently under 
        special use permit to the Sun Valley Company at the 
        Snowbasin Ski Resort are hereby withdrawn from all 
        forms of appropriation under the public land laws 
        (including the mining laws) and from disposition under 
        all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing.
            (3) Deed.--The conveyance of the offered lands to 
        the United States under this section shall be by 
        general warranty or other deed acceptable to the 
        Secretary and in conformity with applicable title 
        standards of the Attorney General of the United States.
            (4) Status of lands.--Upon acceptance of title by 
        the Secretary, the land conveyed to the United States 
        pursuant to this section shall become part of the 
        Wasatch or Cache National Forests as appropriate, and 
        the boundaries of such National Forests shall be 
        adjusted to encompass such lands. Once conveyed, such 
        lands shall be managed in accordance with the Act of 
        March 1, 1911, as amended (commonly known as the 
        ``Weeks Act''), and in accordance with the other laws, 
        rules and regulations applicable to National Forest 
        System lands. This paragraph does not limit the 
        Secretary's authority to adjust the boundaries pursuant 
        to section 11 of the Act of March 1, 1911 (``Weeks 
        Act''). For the purposes of section 7 of the Land and 
        Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 4601-9), 
        the boundaries of the Wasatch and Cache National 
        Forests, as adjusted by this section, shall be 
        considered to be boundaries of the forests as of 
        January 1, 1965.
    (e) Phase Facility Construction and Operation.--
            (1) Phase i facility finding and review.--(A) The 
        Congress has reviewed the Snowbasin Ski Area Master 
        Development Plan dated October 1995 (hereinafter in 
        this subsection referred to as the ``Master Plan''). On 
        the basis of such review, and review of previously 
        completed environmental and other resource studies for 
        the Snowbasin Ski Area, Congress hereby finds that the 
        ``Phase I'' facilities referred to in the Master Plan 
        to be located on National Forest System land after 
        consummation of the land exchange directed by this 
        section are limited in size and scope, are reasonable 
        and necessary to accommodate the 2002 Olympics, and in 
        some cases are required to provide for the safety of 
        skiing competitors and spectators.
            (B) Within 60 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, the Secretary and the Sun Valley Company 
        shall review the Master Plan insofar as such plan 
        pertains to Phase I facilities which are to be 
        constructed and operated wholly or partially on 
        National Forest System lands retained by the Secretary 
        after consummation of the land exchange directed by 
        this section. The Secretary may modify such Phase I 
        facilities upon mutual agreement with the Sun Valley 
        Company or by imposing conditions pursuant to paragraph 
        (2) of this subsection.
            (C) Within 90 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, the Secretary shall submit the reviewed 
        Master Plan on the Phase I facilities, including any 
        modifications made thereto pursuant to subparagraph 
        (B), to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
        of the United States Senate and the Committee on 
        Resources of the United States House of Representatives 
        for a 30-day review period. At the end of the 30-day 
        period, unless otherwise directed by Act of Congress, 
        the Secretary may issue all necessary authorizations 
        for construction and operation of such facilities or 
        modifications thereof in accordance with the procedures 
        and provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection.
            (2) Phase i facility approval, conditions, and 
        timetable.--Within 120 days of receipt of an 
        application by the Sun Valley Company to authorize 
        construction and operation of any particular Phase I 
        facility, facilities, or group of facilities, the 
        Secretary, in consultation with the Sun Valley Company, 
        shall authorize construction and operation of such 
        facility, facilities, or group of facilities, subject 
        to the general policies of the Forest Service 
        pertaining to the construction and operation of ski 
        area facilities on National Forest System lands and 
        subject to reasonable conditions to protect National 
        Forest System resources. In providing authorization to 
        construct and operate a facility, facilities, or group 
        of facilities, the Secretary may not impose any 
        condition that would significantly change the location, 
        size, or scope of the applied for Phase I facility 
        unless--
                    (A) the modification is mutually agreed to 
                by the Secretary and the Sun Valley Company; or
                    (B) the modification is necessary to 
                protect health and safety.
        Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect 
        the Secretary's responsibility to monitor and assure 
        compliance with the conditions set forth in the 
        construction and operation authorization.
            (3) Congressional directions.--Notwithstanding any 
        other provision of law, Congress finds that 
        consummation of the land exchange directed by this 
        section and all determinations, authorizations, and 
        actions taken by the Secretary pursuant to this section 
        pertaining to Phase I facilities on National Forest 
        System lands, or any modifications thereof, to be 
        nondiscretionary actions authorized and directed by 
        Congress and hence to comply with all procedural and 
        other requirements of the laws of the United States. 
        Such determinations, authorizations, and actions shall 
        not be subject to administrative or judicial review.
    (f) No Precedent.--Nothing in subsection (c)(4)(B) of this 
section relating to conditions or limitations on the appraisal 
of the Federal lands, or any provision of subsection (e), 
relating to the approval by the Congress or the Forest Service 
of facilities on National Forest System lands, shall be 
construed as a precedent for subsequent legislation.

SEC. 305. ARKANSAS AND OKLAHOMA LAND EXCHANGE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:
            (1) the Weyerhaeuser Company has offered to the 
        United States Government an exchange of lands under 
        which Weyerhaeuser would receive approximately 48,000 
        acres of Federal land in Arkansas and Oklahoma and all 
        mineral interests and oil and gas interests pertaining 
        to these exchanged lands in which the United States 
        Government has an interest in return for conveying to 
        the United States lands owned by Weyerhaeuser 
        consisting of approximately 181,000 acres of forested 
        wetlands and other forest land of public interest in 
        Arkansas and Oklahoma and all mineral interests and all 
        oil and gas interests pertaining to 48,000 acres of 
        these 181,000 acres of exchanged lands in which 
        Weyerhaeuser has an interest, consisting of--
                    (A) certain lands in Arkansas (Arkansas 
                Ouachita lands) located near Poteau Mountain, 
                Caney Creek Wilderness, Lake Ouachita, Little 
                Missouri Wild and Scenic River, Flatside 
                Wilderness and the Ouachita National Forest;
                    (B) certain lands in Oklahoma (Oklahoma 
                lands) located near the McCurtain County 
                Wilderness, the Broken Bow Reservoir, the 
                Glover River, and the Ouachita National Forest; 
                and
                    (C) certain lands in Arkansas (Arkansas 
                Cossatot lands) located on the Little and 
                Cossatot Rivers and identified as the ``Pond 
                Creek Bottoms'' in the Lower Mississippi River 
                Delta section of the North American Waterfowl 
                Management Plan;
            (2) acquisition of the Arkansas Cossatot lands by 
        the United States will remove the lands in the heart of 
        a critical wetland ecosystem from sustained timber 
        production and other development;
            (3) the acquisition of the Arkansas Ouachita lands 
        and the Oklahoma lands by the United States for 
        administration by the Forest Service will provide an 
        opportunity for enhancement of ecosystem management of 
        the National Forest System lands and resources;
            (4) the Arkansas Ouachita lands and the Oklahoma 
        lands have outstanding wildlife habitat and important 
        recreational values and should continue to be made 
        available for activities such as public hunting, 
        fishing, trapping, nature observation, enjoyment, 
        education, and timber management whenever these 
        activities are consistent with applicable Federal laws 
        and land and resource management plans; these lands, 
        especially in the riparian zones, also harbor 
        endangered, threatened and sensitive plants and animals 
        and the conservation and restoration of these areas are 
        important to the recreational and educational public 
        uses and will represent a valuable ecological resource 
        which should be conserved;
            (5) the private use of the lands the United States 
        will convey to Weyerhaeuser will not conflict with 
        established management objectives on adjacent Federal 
        lands;
            (6) the lands the United States will convey to 
        Weyerhaeuser as part of the exchange described in 
        paragraph (1) do not contain comparable fish, wildlife, 
        or wetland values;
            (7) the values of all lands, mineral interests, and 
        oil and gas interests to be exchanged between the 
        United States and Weyerhaeuser are approximately equal 
        in value; and
            (8) the exchange of lands, mineral interests, and 
        oil and gas interests between Weyerhaeuser and the 
        United States is in the public interest.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to authorize 
and direct the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of 
Agriculture, subject to the terms of this title, to complete,

        between the description of lands, mineral interests, or 
        oil and gas interests to be exchanged pursuant to 
        subsections (d) and (e) and the lands, mineral 
        interests, or oil and gas interests depicted on a map 
        referred to in such subsection, the map shall control. 
        The maps referenced in this section shall be subject to 
        such minor corrections as may be agreed upon by the 
        Secretaries and Weyerhaeuser so long as the Secretary 
        of Agriculture notifies the Committee on Energy and 
        Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the

        interests conveyed and transferred pursuant to this 
        section and the acreage and boundary descriptions of 
        such lands, mineral interests, and oil and gas 
        interests to the Committees on Energy and Natural

        complete the exchange, with respect to the lands, 
        mineral interests, and oil and gas interests that would 
        otherwise be subject to the exchange, the status of

            (7) Values of the respective lands exchanged 
        between the United States and the city of Greeley and 
        The Water Supply and Storage Company pursuant to 
        subsection (a) are deemed to be of approximately equal 
        value, without any need for cash equalization, as based 
        on statements of value prepared by a qualified Forest 
        Service Review Appraiser.
            (8) It is recognized that some Federal lands to be 
        conveyed to the city of Greeley and The Water Supply 
        and Storage Company will create new holdings in 
        otherwise consolidated areas of Federal ownership. If 
        the city or the company decide to permanently 
        discontinue reservoir operations on any of the 
        properties acquired through this exchange, the United 
        States Forest Service, Arapaho-Roosevelt National 
        Forest Supervisor shall be advised of the intent to 
        perform nonreconstructive breaching of the dam for 
        purposes of permanently terminating reservoir 
        operations. Upon such notification, the United States 
        Forest Service will be afforded the opportunity to 
        reacquire property at fair market value or exchange or 
        upon such other terms and conditions as the parties may 
        agree for a period of time not to exceed one year.
            (9) The Federal lands to be exchanged under 
        subsection (a), with the exception of the Seaman 
        Reservoir enlargement area and potential new damsite 
        below Seaman Reservoir on the North Fork of the Cache 
        la Poudre River, are already fully developed and 
        authorized for occupancy by the city of Greeley and The 
        Water Supply and Storage Company. Therefore, this land 
        exchange may be completed without further inventory or 
        consultation under the National Historic Preservation 
        Act. Should the city of Greeley seek enlargement of 
        Seaman Reservoir or construction of a new dam on the 
        North Fork of the Poudre River below Seaman Reservoir 
        for a Seaman Reservoir Enlargement, the site will be 
        subject to all Federal statutes and regulations 
        applicable at the time of proposed construction.
            (10) The Forest Service shall grant a 20-year 
        easement to the city of Greeley for use of the existing 
        cabin in the north half of the southwest quarter of 
        Section 30, Township 8 North, Range 72 West. The 
        easement shall allow the use of the cabin, other 
        improvements, and access to the forest lands nearby. 
        The access road shall be available for city employees 
        to access the cabin for recreational purposes and to 
        the United States Forest Service for administrative 
        purposes.
            (11) The Forest Service shall grant a 20-year 
        easement to the city of Greeley for use of 
        approximately 1 acre of land under the existing cabin 
        in the vicinity of Jacks Gulch Campground on Pingree 
        Road as depicted on the attached map. The easement 
        shall include the administrative use of the access road 
        to the cabin and the reservation of the use of the 
        cabin to those permitted under the existing special use 
        permit.
    (c) Administration of Lands Acquired by the United 
States.--The Rockwell Ranch, Timberline Lake, and Cameron Pass 
Lands acquired by the United States under this section shall be 
added to and administered as part of the Roosevelt National 
Forest. Those portions of such property located within a 
wilderness area shall be added to and administered as part of 
the wilderness area.
    (d) Boundary Modification of the Arapaho National Forest 
and Roosevelt National Forest.--
            (1) In general.--In order to provide for more 
        efficient administration of certain Federal lands 
        adjoining the Arapaho National Forest and Roosevelt 
        National Forest, the exterior boundary of the Arapaho 
        Forest is hereby modified as shown on Department of

        public inspection in the offices of the Chief of the 
        Forest Service and appropriate field offices.
            (2) Administration.--All Federal lands brought 
        within the boundary of the Arapaho National Forest and 
        Roosevelt National Forest by this section are hereby 
        added to the Arapaho National Forest and Roosevelt 
        National Forest, respectively, and shall be 
        administered in accordance with the laws, rules, and 
        regulations applicable to the National Forest System.
            (3) Availability of certain lands.--For the purpose 
        of section 7 of the Land and Water Conservation Act of 
        1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-9), the boundary of the Arapaho 
        National Forest and Roosevelt National Forest, as 
        modified by this subsection, shall be treated as if it

acquire by exchange certain lands which have been or may 
hereafter be conveyed to the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation 
pursuant to the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act and the State of Alaska pursuant to the Alaska 
Statehood Act. These lands consist of--
            (A) approximately 1,270,000 acres of Arctic Slope 
        Regional Corporation lands and are depicted on a map 
        entitled ``Arctic Slope Regional Corporation Killik 
        River Ecosystem Lands'', dated July 1996, appended to 
        which is a legal description of such lands; and
            (B) up to 1,270,000 acres selected by the State of 
        Alaska pursuant to the Alaska Statehood Act, consisting 
        of--
                    (i) approximately 750,000 acres of State of 
                Alaska lands in the Killik River Ecosystem 
                which are depicted on a map entitled ``Study of 
                Potential Addition of State of Alaska and Other 
                Lands, by Exchange, to the Gates of the Arctic 
                Park''; and
                    (ii) the remainder being other State of 
                Alaska lands which are acceptable to the 
                Secretary.
        The Killik River Ecosystem map and the Study of 
        Potential Addition map are on file at the Alaska 
        Regional Office of the National Park Service and the 
        offices of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and 
        Preserve in Fairbanks, Alaska.
    (2) The private lands described in subparagraphs (A) and 
(B)(i) of paragraph (1) may be acquired for addition to the 
Gates of the Arctic National Preserve with the consent of the 
owners, the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, or the State of 
Alaska, respectively. Upon acquisition by the Secretary, such 
lands shall become, and be administered as, a part of Gates of 
the Arctic National Preserve to the same extent as if the lands 
were included within the boundaries of the Preserve by the 
provisions of section 201(4) of the Alaska National Interest 
Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.).
    (b) Acquisition and Exchange Authority: Ogotoruk Creek 
Lands Contaminated by Undisclosed Nuclear Testing.--(1) The 
Secretary of the Interior is authorized to acquire by exchange 
certain additional lands which have been or may hereafter be 
conveyed to the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation pursuant to 
the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. 
These lands consist of approximately 204,860 acres and are 
depicted on a map entitled ``Arctic Slope Regional Corporation 
Ogotoruk Creek Lands Contaminated by Undisclosed Nuclear 
Testing'', dated July 1996, appended to which is a legal 
description of such lands. The Ogotoruk Creek Lands map is on 
file at the Alaska State Office of the Bureau of Land 
Management.
    (2) The lands described in paragraph (1) were selected by 
the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation under the Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act for use as a transportation corridor, 
without any disclosure by the Department of the Interior that 
the southern portion of these lands had been the subject of 
nuclear tests conducted by the United States prior to selection 
by the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. The Arctic Slope 
Regional Corporation selected these lands with no knowledge of 
the nuclear tests that had been conducted on these lands, and 
the Inupiat Eskimo shareholders of the Arctic Slope Regional 
Corporation believe that the radiation tests have caused 
physical injury to some of the shareholders, and therefore 
desire to exchange these lands. The private lands described in 
paragraph (1) may be acquired by the Secretary with the consent 
of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Upon acquisition by 
the Secretary, such lands shall become public lands except 
that, to the extent such lands are located within the exterior 
boundaries of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge--
Chukchi Sea Unit, such lands shall become, and be administered 
by the Secretary as, a part of such unit of the National 
Wildlife Refuge System.
    (c) Other Lands.--To facilitate the exchanges authorized by 
this section, the Secretary is authorized to make available to 
the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and to the State of 
Alaska lands, or interests therein, from public lands within 
the 23,000,000 acre National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The 
Arctic Slope Regional Corporation was precluded from making 
land selections, under the terms of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act, from the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The 
State of Alaska was precluded from making land selections, 
under the terms of the Alaska Statehood Act, from the National 
Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Since 1980, the Federal policy with 
respect to the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska has been 
changed, and this area has been opened to oil and gas leasing.
    (d) Withdrawal.--(1) To facilitate the land exchanges 
authorized by this section, the Secretary is authorized to 
withdraw, subject to valid existing rights, from all forms of 
appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining 
and mineral leasing laws, lands identified for acquisition 
through an exchange under this section by written notices 
submitted no later than 120 days after enactment of this Act,

the State of Alaska.

identify by notice for withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (1) not 
more than twice the number of acres of private land identified 
for exchange in subsections (a) and (b).
    (3) The State of Alaska is authorized to identify by notice 
for withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (1) not more than twice 
the number of acres of State of Alaska land identified for 
exchange in subsection (a).
    (4) In the event of any overlap of lands identified for 
withdrawal and potential acquisition by the Arctic Slope 
Regional Corporation and the State of Alaska, the Secretary 
shall request an identification by the Arctic Slope Regional 
Corporation of one township of land (23,040 acres) within the 
area of overlap and such township shall be available only for 
acquisition by the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. 
Thereafter, the Secretary shall request an identification by 
the State of Alaska of one township of land within the area of 
overlap and such township shall be available only for 
acquisition by the State of Alaska. Thereafter, the Secretary 
shall request alternating identifications by the Arctic Slope 
Regional Corporation and by the State of Alaska of one township 
of land within the area of overlap until all lands within the 
area of overlap shall have been identified by either the Arctic 
Slope Regional Corporation or the State of Alaska.
    (5) The withdrawal of lands required pursuant to paragraph 
(1) shall terminate either upon the consummation of land 
exchanges with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and the 
State of Alaska or upon the expiration of a period of 3 years 
from the date of the withdrawal, whichever first occurs: 
Provided, That the Secretary may terminate the withdrawal of 
any lands withdrawn under this subsection whenever the 
Secretary and the party identifying such lands for withdrawal 
mutually agree to exclude such lands from further consideration 
for exchange under this section; and, Provided further, That 
the Secretary may conduct activities preparatory to leasing oil 
and gas on lands withdrawn pursuant to this subsection.
    (e) Other Laws.--Land exchanges authorized under this 
section shall be consummated in accordance with the provisions 
of this section, section 22(f) of the Alaska Native Claims

of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, and all

the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation pursuant to an exchange 
authorized by subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be 
deemed conveyed and received pursuant to an exchange under 
section 22(f) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
U.S.C. 1601, 1621(f)).
    (f) Other Uses.--Subsistence, cultural, traditional, and 
other uses of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation's 
shareholders and local residents on the lands to be acquired 
under subsections (a) and (b) shall continue to be permitted.

appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this section.

                        use sand and gravel which is reasonably 
                        necessary for on-site development 
                        without compensation or permit on those 
                        portions of the Swanson River Road East 
                        Tract, comprising approximately 
                        1,738.04 acres; where the entire 
                        subsurface of the land is presently 
                        owned by the United States. The United 
                        States shall retain the ownership of 
                        all other sand and gravel located 
                        within the subsurface and KNA shall not

                        necessary for structures, utilities, 
                        transportation systems, and other 
                        development of the surface estate.
                            (iv) The nonexclusive right to 
                        excavate within the subsurface estate 
                        as reasonably necessary for structures, 
                        utilities, transportation systems, and 
                        other development of the surface estate 
                        on the SW\1/4\ section 21, T.6N., 
                        R.9W., Seward Meridian, Alaska, where 
                        the entire subsurface of the land is 
                        owned by the United States and which 
                        public lands shall continue to be 
                        withdrawn from mining following their 
                        removal from the Refuge boundary under 
                        subsection (d)(1)(A). The United States 
                        shall retain the ownership of all other 
                        sand and gravel located within the 
                        subsurface of this parcel.
                            (v) The surface estate of 
                        approximately 280 acres known as the 
                        Beaver Creek Selected Tract. This tract 
                        shall be conveyed to KNA in exchange 
                        for lands conveyed to the Unite States 
                        as described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii).
                    (C) Payment.--The United States shall make 
                a total cash payment to KNA for the above-
                described lands described in subparagraph (B) 
                of $4,443,000, contingent upon the appropriate 
                approvals of the Federal or State of Alaska 
                EVOS Trustees (or both) necessary for any 
                expenditure of the EVOS settlement funds.
                    (D) National register of historic places.--
                Upon completion of the acquisition authorized 
                in paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary shall, at no 
                cost to KNA, in coordination with KNA, promptly 
                undertake to nominate the Stephanka Tract to 
                the National Register of Historic Places, in 
                recognition of the archaeological artifacts 
                from the original Dena'ina Settlement. If the 
                Department of the Interior establishes a 
                historical, cultural, or archaeological 
                interpretive site, KNA shall have the exclusive 
                right to operate a Dena'ina interpretive site 
                on the Stephanka Tract under the regulations 
                and policies of the department. If KNA declines 
                to operate such a site, the Department may do 
                so under its existing authorities. Prior to the 
                Department undertaking any archaeological 
                activities whatsoever on the Stephanka Tract, 
                KNA shall be consulted.
    (d) General Provisions.--
            (1) Removal of kna lands from the national wildlife 
        refuge system.--
                    (A) In general.--Effective on the date of 
                closing for the Acquisition Lands identified in 
                subsection (c)(2)(B), all lands retained by or 
                conveyed to KNA pursuant to this section, and 
                the subsurface interests of CIRI underlying 
                such lands shall be automatically removed from 
                the National Wildlife Refuge System and shall 
                neither be considered as part of the Refuge nor 
                subject to any laws pertaining solely to lands 
                within the boundaries of the Refuge. The 
                conveyance restrictions imposed by section 
                22(g) of ANCSA (i) shall then be ineffective 
                and cease to apply to such interests of KNA and 
                CIRI, and (ii) shall not be applicable to the 
                interests received by KNA in accordance with 
                subsection (b)(2)(B) or to the CIRI interests 
                underlying them. The Secretary shall adjust the 
                boundaries of the Refuge so as to exclude all 
                interests in lands retained or received in 
                exchange by KNA in accordance with this 
                section, including both surface and subsurface, 
                and shall also exclude all interests currently 
                held by CIRI. On lands within the Swanson River 
                Road East Tract, the boundary adjustment shall 
                only include the surface estate where the 
                subsurface estate is retained by the United 
                States.
                    (B) Agreement.--(i) The Secretary, KNA, and 
                CIRI shall execute an agreement within 45 days 
                of the date of enactment of this section which 
                preserves CIRI's rights under paragraph 1(B)(1) 
                of the Terms and Conditions, addresses CIRI's 
                obligations under such paragraph, and 
                adequately addresses management issues 
                associated with the boundary adjustment set 
                forth in this section and with the differing 
                interests in land resulting from enactment of 
                this section.
                    (ii) In the event that no agreement is 
                executed as provided for in clause (i), solely 
                for the purposes of administering CIRI's rights 
                and obligations under paragraph 1(B)(1) of the 
                Terms and Conditions, the Secretary and CIRI 
                shall be deemed to have retained their 
                respective rights and obligations with respect 
                to CIRI's subsurface interests under the 
                requirements of the terms and Conditions in 
                effect on June 18, 1996. Notwithstanding the 
                boundary adjustments made pursuant to this 
                section, conveyances to KNA shall be deemed to 
                remain subject to the Secretary's and CIRI's 
                rights and obligations under paragraph 1(B)(1) 
                of the Terms and Conditions.
                    (C) Authorization.--The Secretary is 
                authorized to acquire by purchase or exchange, 
                on a willing seller basis only, any lands 
                retained by or conveyed to KNA. In the event 
                that any lands owned by KNA are subsequently 
                acquired by the United States, they shall be 
                automatically included in the Refuge System. 
                The laws and regulations applicable to Refuge 
                lands shall then apply to these lands and the 
                Secretary shall then adjust the boundaries 
                accordingly.
                    (D) Certain ciri and kna rights.--Nothing 
                in this section is intended to enlarge or 
                diminish the authorities, rights, duties, 
                obligations, or the property rights held by 
                CIRI under the Terms and Conditions, or 
                otherwise except as set forth in this section. 
                In the event of the purchase by the United 
                States of any lands from KNA in accordance with 
                subsection (c)(1)(C), the United States shall 
                reassume from KNA the rights it previously held 
                under the Terms and Conditions and the 
                provisions in any patent implementing section 
                22(g) of ANCSA will again apply.
                    (E) Certain in-lieu subsurface 
                entitlement.--By virtue of implementation of 
                this section, CIRI is deemed entitled to 1,207 
                acres of in-lieu subsurface entitlement under 
                section 12(a)(1) of ANCSA. Such entitlement 
                shall be fulfilled in accordance with paragraph 
                1(B)(2)(A) of the Terms and Conditions.
    (e) Maps and Legal Descriptions.--Maps and a legal 
description of the lands described above in subsection (c)(2) 
shall be on file and available for public inspection in the 
appropriate offices of the United States Department of the 
Interior, and the Secretary shall, no later than 90 days after 
enactment of this section, prepare a legal description of the 
lands described in subsection (c)(2)(A)(v). Such maps and legal 
description shall have the same force and effect as if included 
in this section, except that the Secretary may correct clerical 
and typographical errors.
    (f) Acceptance.--KNA may accept the offer made in this 
section by notifying the Secretary in writing of its decision

depicting the lands transferred and conveyed pursuant to this 
section and the acreage and legal descriptions of such lands to 
the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee 
on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.

the applicable provisions of the Wilderness Act and ANILCA.
    (i) Designation of Lake Todatonen Special Management 
Area.--To offset the removal of KNA lands from the Refuge 
System, the Secretary is hereby authorized to withdraw, subject 
to valid existing rights, and to create as a special management

                Civil War;
                    (B) the town of Nicodemus is symbolic of

                familiar with to seek personal freedom and the 
                opportunity to develop their talents and 
                capabilities; and

SEC. 603. RICHMOND NATIONAL BATTLEFIELD PARK.

    (a) Findings and Purpose.--Section 1 of the Act of March 2, 
1936 (chapter 113, 49 Stat. 1155; 16 U.S.C. 423j), is amended 
to read as follows:

``SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    ``(a) Findings.--In 1996 the Congress finds that:
            ``(1) In 1936 the Congress established the Richmond 
        National Battlefield Park in and around the city of 
        Richmond, Virginia. The park's boundary was established 
        to permit the inclusion of all military battlefield 
        areas related to the battles fought during the Civil 
        War in defense of and against the city of Richmond. The 
        park originally included the area then known as the 
        Richmond Battlefield State Park.
            ``(2) The total acreage of the area identified in 
        1936 for consideration for inclusion in the Richmond 
        National Battlefield Park encompasses approximately 
        225,000 acres in and around the city of Richmond, 
        Virginia. A study undertaken by the congressionally 
        authorized Civil War Sites Advisory Committee 
        determined that within those 225,000 acres, the 
        historically significant areas in and around Richmond 
        relating to the campaigns against and in defense of 
        Richmond encompass approximately 38,000 acres. The 
        National Park Service, through its general management 
        planning process for Richmond National Battlefield 
        Park, has identified approximately 7,121 acres which 
        satisfy the National Park Service criteria of 
        significance, integrity, feasibility, and suitability 
        for inclusion in Richmond National Battlefield Park.
            ``(3) There is national interest in protecting and 
        preserving sites of historic significance associated 
        with the Civil War and Richmond.
            ``(4) The Commonwealth of Virginia and its local 
        units of government have authority to prevent or 
        minimize adverse uses of these historic resources and 
        can play a significant role in the protection of the 
        historic resources related to the battles of Richmond.
    ``(b) Purposes.--Therefore, it is the purpose of this Act--
            ``(1) to establish a revised boundary for the 
        Richmond National Battlefield Park based on the 
        findings of the Civil War Sites Advisory Committee and 
        the National Park Service; and
            ``(2) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to 
        work in cooperation with the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
        the city of Richmond, and other political subdivisions 
        of the Commonwealth, other public entities, and the 
        private sector in the management, protection, and 
        interpretation of the resources associated with the 
        Civil War and the Battles of Richmond in and around the 
        city of Richmond, Virginia.''.
    (b) Modification of Boundary.--Section 2 of the Act of 
March 2, 1936 (chapter 113, 49 Stat. 1155; 16 U.S.C. 423k), is 
amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 2. BOUNDARY.

    ``The boundary of the Richmond National Battlefield Park 
(hereinafter in this Act referred to as the `park') is hereby 
modified to comprise the lands, waters, and interests in lands 
therein that, on the day before the date of the enactment of 
this Act, were in Federal ownership and were administered by 
the Secretary of the Interior as part of the park.''.
    (c) Land Acquisition.--The Act of March 2, 1936 (chapter 
113, 49 Stat. 1155; 16 U.S.C. 423j and following), is amended 
by adding the following new section after section 3:

``SEC. 4. LAND ACQUISITION.

    ``(a) The Secretary is authorized to acquire any lands and 
interests in lands identified in the general management plan 
for the park approved June 7, 1996, and depicted within the 
area delineated as `Park Boundary' on the map entitled 
`Richmond National Battlefield Park Boundary Map', as numbered 
367-NEFA 80026 and dated August 1996, which shall be on file 
and available for inspection in the Office of the Director of 
the National Park Service, Department of the Interior.
    ``(b) The Secretary is authorized to acquire the lands 
identified in subsection (a) by donation, purchase with donated 
or appropriated funds, exchange, or otherwise. Privately owned 
lands or the interest therein may be acquired only with the 
consent of the property owner. In acquiring lands and interest 
in lands under this Act, the Secretary shall acquire the 
minimum Federal interests necessary to achieve the objectives 
of the park.
    ``(c) Upon acquisition by the Secretary of any lands and 
interests in lands identified in subsection (a), the Secretary 
shall revise the boundary of the park to include those lands 
within the boundary of the park and shall manage them as part 
of the park and consistent with the purposes of the Act.''.
    (d) Park Management and Administration.--The Act of March 
2, 1936 (chapter 113; 49 Stat. 1155; 16 U.S.C. 423j and 
following), is amended by adding the following new section 
after section 4:

``SEC. 5. PARK MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.

    ``(a) In administering the park, the Secretary shall

general public, the Battles of Richmond in the larger context 
of the Civil War and American history, including the causes and 
consequences of the Civil War and the effects of the war on all 
the American people.
    ``(b) The Secretary is directed to work with the 
Commonwealth of Virginia, its political subdivisions, including 
the city of Richmond, private property owners, and the private 
sector to develop mechanisms to protect and interpret the 
resources identified within the boundary as depicted on the map 
identified in section 2 of this Act. In order to carry out this 
section, the Secretary is authorized to enter into cooperative 
agreements with the public and private sectors to carry out the

                            TITLE VII--FEES

SEC. 701. SKI AREA PERMIT RENTAL CHARGE.

    (a) The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental 
charge for all ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 of 
the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 
497b), the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 144; 16 
U.S.C. 497), or the 9th through 20th paragraphs under the 
heading ``SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS'' under the heading 
``UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR'' in the Act of June 4, 
1897 (30 Stat. 34, chapter 2), on National Forest System lands. 
Permit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to the 
National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be calculated 
as set forth in subsection (b). Permit rental charges for 
existing ski area permits issued pursuant to the Act of March 
4, 1915, and the Act of June 4, 1897, shall be calculated in 
accordance with those existing permits: Provided, That a 
permittee may, at the permittee's option, use the calculation 
method set forth in subsection (b).
    (b)(1) The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be 
calculated by adding the permittee's gross revenues from lift 
ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from ski 
school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by the 
slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest 
System land. That amount shall be increased by the gross year-
round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) physically 
located on national forest land, including all permittee or 
subpermittee lodging, food service, rental shops, parking and 
other ancillary operations, to determine the adjusted gross 
revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental charge. The final 
rental charge shall be calculated by multiplying the AGR by the 
following percentages for each revenue bracket and adding the 
total for each revenue bracket:
            (A) 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below 
        $3,000,000;
            (B) 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between 
        $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;
            (C) 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between 
        $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and
            (D) 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross 
        revenue that exceeds $50,000,000.
Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection the 
ski area permit fee (SAPF) formula can be simply illustrated 
as:

      SAPF = ((LT + SS)  x  STFP) + GRAF = AGR; AGR  x  % BRACKETS

    (2) In cases where ski areas are only partially located on 
national forest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on 
national forest land referred to in subsection (b) shall be 
calculated as generally described in the Forest Service Manual 
in effect as of January 1, 1992. Revenues from Nordic ski 
operations shall be included or excluded from the rental charge 
calculation according to the percentage of trails physically 
located on national forest land.
    (3) In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair 
and equitable to both the United States and the ski area 
permittees, the adjusted gross revenue figures for each revenue 
bracket in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted annually by the 
percent increase or decrease in the national Consumer Price 
Index for the preceding calendar year. No later than 3 years 
after the date of enactment of this Act and every 5 years 
thereafter the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and 
the Committee on Resources of the United States House of 
Representatives a report analyzing whether the ski area permit 
rental charge legislated by this Act is returning a fair market 
value rental to the United States together with any 
recommendations the Secretary may have for modifications of the 
system.
    (c) The rental charge set forth in subsection (b) shall be 
due on June 1 of each year and shall be paid or pre-paid by the 
permittee on a monthly, quarterly, annual or other schedule as 
determined appropriate by the Secretary in consultation with 
the permittee. Unless mutually agreed otherwise by the 
Secretary and the permittee, the payment or prepayment schedule 
shall conform to the permittee's schedule in effect prior to 
enactment of this Act. To reduce costs to the permittee and the 
Forest Service, the Secretary shall each year provide the 
permittee with a standardized form and worksheets (including 
annual rental charge calculation brackets and rates) to be used 
for rental charge calculation and submitted with the rental 
charge payment. Information provided on such forms shall be 
compiled by the Secretary annually and kept in the Office of 
the Chief, United States Forest Service.
    (d) The ski area permit rental charge set forth in this 
section shall become effective on June 1, 1996 and cover 
receipts retroactive to June 1, 1995: Provided however, That if 
a permittee has paid rental charges for the period June 1, 
1995, to June 1, 1996, under the graduated rate rental charge 
system formula in effect prior to the date of enactment of this 
Act, such rental charges shall be credited toward the new 
rental charge due on June 1, 1996. In order to ensure 
increasing rental charge receipt levels to the United States 
during transition from the graduated rate rental charge system 
formula to the formula of this Act, the rental charge paid by 
any individual permittee shall be--
            (1) for the 1995-1996 permit year, either the 
        rental charge paid for the preceding 1994-1995 base 
        year or the rental charge calculated pursuant to this 
        Act, whichever is higher;
            (2) for the 1996-1997 permit year, either the 
        rental charge paid for the 1994-1995 base year or the 
        rental charge calculated pursuant to this Act, 
        whichever is higher; and
            (3) for the 1997-1998 permit year, either the 
        rental charge for the 1994-1995 base year or the rental 
        charge calculated pursuant to this Act, whichever is 
        higher.
If an individual permittee's adjusted gross revenue for the 
1995-1996, 1996-1997, or 1997-1998 permit years falls more than 
10 percent below the 1994-1995 base year, the rental charge 
paid shall be the rental charge calculated pursuant to this 
Act.
    (e) Under no circumstances shall revenue, or subpermittee 
revenue (other than lift ticket, area use pass, or ski school 
sales) obtained from operations physically located on non-
national forest land be included in the ski area permit rental 
charge calculation.
    (f) To reduce administrative costs of ski area permittees 
and the Forest Service the terms ``revenue'' and ``sales'', as 
used in this section, shall mean actual income from sales and 
shall not include sales of operating equipment, refunds, rent 
paid to the permittee by sublessees, sponsor contributions to 
special events or any amounts attributable to employee 
gratuities or employee lift tickets, discounts, or other goods 
or services (except for bartered goods and complimentary lift 
tickets) for which the permittee does not receive money.
    (g) In cases where an area of national forest land is under 
a ski area permit but the permittee does not have revenue or 
sales qualifying for rental charge payment pursuant to 
subsection (a), the permittee shall pay an annual minimum 
rental charge of $2 for each national forest acre under permit 
or a percentage of appraised land value, as determined 
appropriate by the Secretary.
    (h) Where the new rental charge provided for in subsection 
(b)(1) results in an increase in permit rental charge greater 
than one-half of 1 percent of the permittee's adjusted gross 
revenue as determined under subsection (b)(1), the new rental 
charge shall be phased in over a five year period in a manner 
providing for increases of approximately equal increments.
    (i) To reduce Federal costs in administering the provisions 
of this Act, the reissuance of a ski area permit to provide 
activities similar in nature and amount to the activities 
provided under the previous permit shall not constitute a major 
Federal action for the purposes of the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.).
    (j) Subject to valid existing rights, all lands located 
within the boundaries of ski area permits issued prior to, on 
or after the date of enactment of this Act pursuant to 
authority of the Act of March 4, 1915 (38 Stat. 1101, chapter 
144; 16 U.S.C. 497), and the Act of June 4, 1897, or the 
National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 497b) 
are hereby and henceforth automatically withdrawn from all 
forms of appropriation under the mining laws and from 
disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal 
leasing and all amendments thereto. Such withdrawal shall 
continue for the full term of the permit and any modification, 
reissuance, or renewal thereof. Unless the Secretary requests 
otherwise of the Secretary of the Interior, such withdrawal 
shall be canceled automatically upon expiration or other 
termination of the permit and the land automatically restored 
to all appropriation not otherwise restricted under the public 
land laws.

        such fees not later than six months prior to such fee 
        changes.
            ``(B) In the case of changes to commercial tour 
        fees or initiating a new commercial tour fee, the

        provides economic incentives for use of alternative 
        modes of transportation, including mass transportation,

        Secretaries may authorize units of State or local 
        government, organizations, businesses, and nonprofit 
        entities to sell and collect admission fees, including 
        the Golden Eagle Passport, subject to such conditions 
        as the Secretaries may jointly prescribe. The 
        Secretaries shall develop detailed guidelines for

        Passport. Such passport shall provide the same 
        privileges as any other passport issued pursuant to

        or Secretaries are authorized to make available an 
        annual admission permit. The permit shall convey the 
        privileges of, and shall be subject to the same terms 
        and conditions as, the Golden Eagle Passport, except 
        that it shall be valid only for admission into the 
        specific area or areas indicated at the time of 
        purchase. The fee for an annual geographic admission 
        permit shall be no greater than $25.

        establish procedures providing for the issuance of a 
        lifetime admission permit to any citizen of, or person 
        legally domiciled in, the United States, if such 
        citizen or person applies for such permit and is 
        permanently disabled. Such procedures shall ensure that 
        a lifetime admission permit shall be issued only to 
        persons who have been medically determined to be 
        permanently disabled. A lifetime admission permit shall 
        be nontransferable, shall be issued without charge, and

regulations issued under this section may, within areas under 
the administration or authority of such administering Secretary

following at the end: ``Sixty percent of the fees paid by

deposited into a special account and that such funds shall be 
available--
            ``(1) to the extent determined necessary, to 
        acquire and preposition necessary and adequate 
        emergency response equipment to prevent harm or the 
        threat of harm to aquatic park resources from

        natural resource values of Glacier Bay National Park. 
        The investigations provided for in this subsection 
        shall be designed to provide information of value to 
        the Secretary, in determining any appropriate 
        limitations on permittees' activity in Glacier Bay. The 
        Secretary shall protect park resources through 
        limitations on permittees in Glacier Bay only if the 
        need for such limitations is based on substantial 
        verifiable scientific information, including, but not 
        limited to, information made available through the 
        investigations under this subsection. The Secretary may 
        not impose any additional permittee operating 
        conditions in the areas of air, water, and oil 
        pollution beyond those determined and enforced by other 
        appropriate agencies. When competitively awarding 
        permits to enter Glacier Bay, the Secretary may take 
        into account the relative impact particular permittees 
        will have on park values and resources, provided that 
        no operating conditions or limitations relating to 
        noise abatement shall be imposed unless the Secretary 
        determines, based on the weight of the evidence from 
        all available studies including verifiable scientific 
        information from the investigations provided for in 
        this subsection, that such limitations or conditions 
        are necessary to protect park values and resources. 
        Fees paid by certain permittees for the privilege of 
        entering into Glacier Bay shall not exceed $5 per 
        passenger. For the purposes of this subsection, 
        `certain permittee' shall mean a permittee which 
        provides overnight accommodations for at least 500 
        passengers for an itinerary of at least 3 nights, and 
        `permittee' shall mean a concessionaire providing 
        visitor services within Glacier Bay. Nothing in this 
        subsection authorizes the Secretary to require 
        additional categories of permits in Glacier Bay 
        National Park.''.

                    (A) to develop where necessary an adequate 
                supply of quality housing units for field 
                employees of the National Park Service within a 
                reasonable time frame;
                    (B) to expand the alternatives available 
                for construction and repair of essential 
                government housing;
                    (C) to rely on the private sector to 
                finance or supply housing in carrying out this 
                section, to the maximum extent possible, in 
                order to reduce the need for Federal 
                appropriations;
                    (D) to ensure that adequate funds are 
                available to provide for long-term maintenance 
                needs of field employee housing; and
                    (E) to eliminate unnecessary government 
                housing and locate such housing as is required 
                in a manner such that primary resource values 
                are not impaired.
            (2) General authority.--To enhance the ability of 
        the Secretary of the Interior (hereafter in this 
        subsection referred to as ``the Secretary''), acting 
        through the Director of the National Park Service, to 
        effectively manage units of the National Park System, 
        the Secretary is authorized where necessary and 
        justified to make available employee housing, on or off 
        the lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the 
        National Park Service, and to rent or lease such 
        housing to field employees of the National Park Service 
        at rates based on the reasonable value of the housing 
        in accordance with requirements applicable under 
        section 5911 of title 5, United States Code.
            (3) Review and revision of housing criteria.--Upon 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall review 
        and revise the existing criteria under which housing is 
        provided to employees of the National Park Service. 
        Specifically, the Secretary shall examine the existing 
        criteria with respect to what circumstances the 
        National Park Service requires an employee to occupy 
        Government quarters to provide necessary services, 
        protect Government property, or because of a lack of 
        availability of non-Federal housing in the geographic 
        area.
            (4) Submission of report.--A report detailing the 
        results of the revisions required by paragraph (3) 
        shall be submitted to the Committee on Resources of the 
        House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy 
        and Natural Resources of the Senate not later than 180 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act. The 
        report shall include justifications for keeping, or for 
        changing, each of the criteria or factors used by the 
        Department of the Interior with regard to the provision 
        of housing to employees of the National Park Service.
            (5) Review of condition of and costs relating to 
        housing.--Using the revised criteria developed under 
        paragraph (3), the Secretary shall undertake a review, 
        for each unit of the National Park System, of existing 
        government-owned housing provided to employees of the 
        National Park Service. The review shall include an 
        assessment of the physical condition of such housing 
        and the suitability of such housing to effectively 
        carry out the missions of the Department of the 
        Interior and the National Park Service. For each unit 
        of such housing, the Secretary shall determine whether 
        the unit is needed and justified. The review shall 
        include estimates of the cost of bringing each such 
        unit that is needed and justified into usable condition 
        that meets all applicable legal housing requirements 
        or, if the unit is determined to be obsolete but is 
        still warranted to carry out the missions of the 
        Department of the Interior and the National Park 
        Service, the cost of replacing the unit.
            (6) Authorization for housing agreements.--For 
        those units of the National Park System for which the 
        review required by paragraphs (3) and (5) has been 
        completed, the Secretary is authorized, pursuant to the 
        authorities contained in this subsection and subject to 
        the appropriation of necessary funds in advance, to 
        enter into housing agreements with housing entities 
        under which such housing entities may develop, 
        construct, rehabilitate, or manage housing, located on 
        or off public lands, for rent or lease to National Park 
        Service employees who meet the housing eligibility 
        criteria developed by the Secretary pursuant to this 
        Act.
            (7) Joint public-private sector housing programs.--
                    (A) Lease to build program.--Subject to the 
                appropriation of necessary funds in advance,

                        interests in land to qualified persons 
                        for the construction of field employee 
                        quarters for any period not to exceed 
                        50 years; and

                    (B) Competitive leasing.--Each lease under 
                subparagraph (A)(i) shall be awarded through 
                the use of publicly advertised, competitively 
                bid, or competitively negotiated contracting 
                procedures.
                    (C) Terms and conditions.--Each lease under 
                subparagraph (A)(i)--
                            (i) shall stipulate whether 
                        operation and maintenance of field 
                        employee quarters is to be provided by

                        field employee quarters be done in 
                        accordance with the requirements of the 
                        National Park Service and local

                        standards;
                            (iii) shall contain such additional 
                        terms and conditions as may be 
                        appropriate to protect the Federal 
                        interest, including limits on rents the 
                        lessee may charge field employees for 
                        the occupancy of quarters, conditions 
                        on maintenance and repairs, and 
                        agreements on the provision of charges 
                        for utilities and other infrastructure; 
                        and
                            (iv) may be granted at less than 
                        fair market value if the Secretary 
                        determines that such lease will improve 
                        the quality and availability of field 
                        employee quarters available.
                    (D) Contributions by united states.--The 
                Secretary may make payments, subject to 
                appropriations, or contributions in kind either 
                in advance of or on a continuing basis to 
                reduce the costs of planning, construction, or 
                rehabilitation of quarters on or off Federal 
                lands under a lease under this paragraph.
            (8) Rental guarantee program.--
                    (A) General authority.--Subject to the 
                appropriation of necessary funds in advance,

                            (ii) at a rental rate that exceeds 
                        the rate based on the reasonable value 
                        of the housing in accordance with 
                        requirements applicable under section 
                        5911 of title 5, United States Code.
                In no event shall outstanding guarantees be in

                    (C) Rental to government employees.--A 
                guarantee may be made under this subsection 
                only if the lessee agrees to permit the 
                Secretary to utilize for housing purposes any 
                units for which the guarantee is made.

                level of operation and maintenance.--The lease 
                shall be null and void if the lessee fails to

                maintenance.
            (9) Joint development authority.--The Secretary may

                appropriation of necessary funds in advance, 
                the Secretary may enter into contracts of any 
                duration for the management, repair, and 
                maintenance of field employee quarters.
                    (B) Terms and conditions.--Any such

                appropriate to protect the interests of the 
                United States and assure that necessary 
                quarters are available to field employees.
            (11) Leasing of seasonal employee quarters.--
                    (A) General authority.--Subject to 
                subparagraph (B), the Secretary may lease 
                quarters at or near a unit of the national park 
                system for use as seasonal quarters for field 
                employees. The rent charged to field employees 
                under such a lease shall be a rate based on the 
                reasonable value of the quarters in accordance 
                with requirements applicable under section 5911 
                of title 5, United States Code.
                    (B) Limitation.--The Secretary may only 
                issue a lease under subparagraph (A) if the

                adequate and affordable seasonal quarters at or 
                near such unit and that--
                            (i) the requirement for such 
                        seasonal field employee quarters is 
                        temporary; or
                            (ii) leasing would be more cost 
                        effective than construction of new 
                        seasonal field employee quarters.
                    (C) Unrecovered costs.--The Secretary may

                quarters under this paragraph from annual 
                appropriations for the year in which such lease 
                is made.
            (12) Survey of existing facilities.--The Secretary 
        shall--
                    (A) complete a condition assessment for all 
                field employee housing, including the physical 
                condition of such housing and the necessity and 
                suitability of such housing for carrying out 
                the agency mission, using existing information; 
                and
                    (B) develop an agency-wide priority 
                listing, by structure, identifying those units 
                in greatest need for repair, rehabilitation, 
                replacement, or initial construction.
            (13) Use of housing-related funds.--Expenditure of 
        any funds authorized and appropriated for new 
        construction, repair, or rehabilitation of housing 
        under this section shall follow the housing priority 
        listing established by the agency under paragraph (13), 
        in sequential order, to the maximum extent practicable.
            (14) Annual budget submittal.--The President's 
        proposed budget to Congress for the first fiscal year 
        beginning after enactment of this Act, and for each 
        subsequent fiscal year, shall include identification of 
        nonconstruction funds to be spent for National Park 
        Service housing maintenance and operations which are in 
        addition to rental receipts collected.
            (15) Study of housing allowances.--Within 12 months 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
        shall conduct a study to determine the feasibility of 
        providing eligible employees of the National Park 
        Service with housing allowances rather than government 
        housing. The study shall specifically examine the 
        feasibility of providing rental allowances to temporary 
        and lower paid permanent employees. Whenever the 
        Secretary submits a copy of such study to the Office of 
        Management and Budget, he shall concurrently transmit 
        copies of the report to the Resources Committee of the 
        United States House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United 
        States Senate.
            (16) Study of sale of employee housing.--Within 18 
        months of the date of the enactment of the Act, the 
        Secretary shall complete a study of the sale of 
        Government quarters to a cooperative consisting of 
        field employees. The Secretary shall examine the 
        potential benefits to the Government as well as the 
        employees and any risks associated with such a program.
            (17) General provisions.--
                    (A) Construction limitations on federal 
                lands.--The Secretary may not utilize any lands 
                for the purposes of providing field employee 
                housing under this section which will impact 
                primary resource values of the area or 
                adversely affect the mission of the agency.
                    (B) Rental rates.--To the extent 
                practicable, the Secretary shall establish 
                rental rates for all quarters occupied by field 
                employees of the National Park Service that are 
                based on the reasonable value of the quarters 
                in accordance with requirements applicable 
                under section 5911 of title 5, United States 
                Code.
                    (C) Exemption from leasing requirements.--
                The provisions of section 5 of the Act of July 
                15, 1968 (82 Stat. 354, 356; 16 U.S.C. 460l-
                22), and section 321 of the Act of June 30,

SEC. 1023. RECREATION LAKES.

    (a) Findings and Purposes.--The Congress finds that the 
Federal Government, under the authority of the Reclamation Act 
and other statutes, has developed manmade lakes and reservoirs 
that have become a powerful magnet for diverse recreational 
activities and that such activities contribute to the well-
being of families and individuals and the economic viability of 
local communities. The Congress further finds that in order to 
further the purposes of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, 
the President should appoint an advisory commission to review 
the current and anticipated demand for recreational 
opportunities at federally-managed manmade lakes and reservoirs 
through creative partnerships involving Federal, State and 
local governments and the private sector and to develop 
alternatives for enhanced recreational use of such facilities.
    (b) Commission.--The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act 
of 1965 (P.L. 88-578, 78 Stat. 897) is amended by adding at the 
end the following new section:
    ``Sec. 13. (a) The President shall appoint an advisory 
commission to review the opportunities for enhanced 
opportunities for water based recreation which shall submit a 
report to the President and to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources of the Senate and in the House of 
Representatives to the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure and the Committee on Resources of the House of 
Representatives within one year from the date of enactment of 
this section.
    ``(b) The members of the Commission shall include--
            ``(1) the Secretary of the Interior, or his 
        designee;
            ``(2) the Secretary of the Army, or his designee;
            ``(3) the Chairman of the Tennessee Valley 
        Authority, or his designee;
            ``(4) the Secretary of Agriculture, or his 
        designee;
            ``(5) a person nominated by the National Governor's 
        Association; and
            ``(6) four persons familiar with the interests of 
        the recreation and tourism industry, conservation and 
        recreation use, Indian tribes, and local governments, 
        at least one of whom shall be familiar with the 
        economics and financing of recreation related 
        infrastructure.
    ``(c) The President shall appoint one member to serve as 
Chairman. Any vacancy on the Commission shall be filled in the 
same manner as the original appointment. Members of the 
Commission shall serve without compensation but shall be 
reimbursed for travel, subsistence, and other necessary 
expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. 
The Secretary of the Interior shall provide all financial, 
administrative, and staffing requirements for the Commission, 
including office space, furnishings, and equipment. The heads 
of other Federal agencies are authorized, at the request of the 
Commission, to provide such information or personnel, to the 
extent permitted by law and within the limits of available 
funds, to the Commission as may be useful to accomplish the 
purposes of this section.
    ``(d) The Commission may hold such hearings, sit and act at 
such times and places, take such testimony, and receive such 
evidence as it deems advisable: Provided, That, to the maximum 
extent possible, the Commission shall use existing data and 
research. The Commission is authorized to use the United States 
mail in the same manner and upon the same conditions as other 
departments and agencies of the United States.
    ``(e) The report shall review the extent of water related 
recreation at Federal manmade lakes and reservoirs and shall 
develop alternatives to enhance the opportunities for such use 
by the public. In developing the report, the Commission shall--
            ``(1) review the extent to which recreation 
        components identified in specific authorizations 
        associated with individual federal manmade lakes and 
        reservoirs have been accomplished,
            ``(2) evaluate the feasibility of enhancing 
        recreation opportunities at federally-managed lakes and 
        reservoirs under existing statutes,
            ``(3) consider legislative changes that would 
        enhance recreation opportunities consistent with and 
        subject to the achievement of the authorized purposes 
        of federal water projects, and
            ``(4) make recommendations on alternatives for 
        enhanced recreation opportunities including, but not 
        limited to, the establishment of a National Recreation 
        Lake System under which specific lakes would receive 
        national designation and which would be managed through 
        innovative partnership-based agreements between federal 
        agencies, State and local units of government, and the 
        private sector.
Any such alternatives shall be consistent with and subject to 
the authorized purposes for any manmade lakes and reservoirs 
and shall emphasize private sector initiatives in concert with 
State and local units of government.''.

SEC. 1032. UMPQUA RIVER LAND EXCHANGE STUDY: POLICY AND DIRECTION.

    (a) In General.--The Secretaries of the Interior and 
Agriculture (Secretaries) are hereby authorized and directed to 
consult, coordinate and cooperate with the Umpqua Land Exchange 
Project (ULEP), affected units and agencies of State and local 
government, and, as appropriate, the World Forestry Center and 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to assist ULEP's ongoing 
efforts in studying and analyzing land exchange opportunities 
in the Umpqua River basin and to provide scientific, technical, 
research, mapping and other assistance and information to such 
entities. Such consultation, coordination and cooperation shall 
at a minimum include, but not be limited to--
            (1) working with ULEP to develop or assemble 
        comprehensive scientific and other information 
        (including comprehensive and integrated mapping) 
        concerning the Umpqua River basin's resources of 
        forest, plants, wildlife, fisheries (anadromous and 
        other), recreational opportunities, wetlands, riparian 
        habitat and other physical or natural resources;
            (2) working with ULEP to identify general or 
        specific areas within the basin where land exchanges 
        could promote consolidation of forestland ownership for 
        long-term, sustained timber production; protection and 
        restoration of habitat for plants, fish and wildlife 
        (including any federally listed threatened or 
        endangered species); protection of drinking water 
        supplies; recovery of threatened and endangered 
        species; protection and restoration of wetlands, 
        riparian lands and other environmentally sensitive 
        areas; consolidation of land ownership for improved 
        public access and a broad array of recreational uses; 
        and consolidation of land ownership to achieve 
        management efficiency and reduced costs of 
        administration; and
            (3) developing a joint report for submission to the 
        Congress which discusses land exchange opportunities in 
        the basin and outlines either a specific land exchange 
        proposal or proposals which may merit consideration by 
        the Secretaries or the Congress, or ideas and 
        recommendations for new authorizations, direction, or 
        changes in existing law or policy to expedite and 
        facilitate the consummation of beneficial land 
        exchanges in the basin via administrative means.
    (b) Matters for Specific Study.--In analyzing land exchange 
opportunities with ULEP, the Secretaries shall give priority to 
assisting ULEP's ongoing efforts in:
            (1) studying, identifying, and mapping areas where 
        the consolidation of land ownership via land exchanges 
        could promote the goals of long term species and 
        watershed protection and utilization, including but not 
        limited to the goals of the Endangered Species Act of 
        1973 more effectively than current land ownership 
        patterns and whether any changes in law or policy 
        applicable to such lands after consummation of an 
        exchange would be advisable or necessary to achieve 
        such goals;
            (2) studying, identifying and mapping areas where 
        land exchanges might be utilized to better satisfy the 
        goals of sustainable timber harvest, including studying 
        whether changes in existing law or policy applicable to 
        such lands after consummation of an exchange would be 
        advisable or necessary to achieve such goals;
            (3) identifying issues and studying options and 
        alternatives, including possible changes in existing 
        law or policy, to ensure that combined post-exchange 
        revenues to units of local government from state and 
        local property, severance and other taxes or levies and 
        shared Federal land receipts will approximate pre-
        exchange revenues;
            (4) identifying issues and studying whether 
        possible changes in law, special appraisal instruction, 
        or changes in certain Federal appraisal procedures 
        might be advisable or necessary to facilitate the 
        appraisal of potential exchange lands which may have 
        special characteristics or restrictions affecting land 
        values;
            (5) identifying issues and studying options and 
        alternatives, including changes in existing laws or 
        policy, for achieving land exchanges without reducing 
        the net supply of timber available to small business;
            (6) identifying, mapping, and recommending 
        potential changes in land use plans, land 
        classifications, or other actions which might be 
        advisable or necessary to expedite, facilitate or 
        consummate land exchanges in certain areas;
            (7) analyzing potential sources for new or enhanced 
        Federal, State, or other funding to promote improved 
        resource protection, species recovery, and management 
        in the basin; and
            (8) identifying and analyzing whether increased 
        efficiency and better land and resource management 
        could occur through either consolidation of Federal 
        forest management under one agency or exchange of lands 
        between the Forest Service and Bureau of Land 
        Management.
    (c) Report to Congress.--No later than February 1, 1998, 
ULEP and the Secretaries shall submit a joint report to the 
Committee on Resources of the United States House of 
Representatives and to the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources of the United States Senate concerning their studies, 
findings, recommendations, mapping and other activities 
conducted pursuant to this section.
    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--In furtherance of the 
purposes of this section, there is hereby authorized to be 
appropriated the sum of $2,000,000, to remain available until 
expended.

        TITLE XI--CALIFORNIA BAY DELTA ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT

SEC. 1101. PROGRAM FUNDING.

    (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--For each of the 
fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, there are authorized to be 
appropriated an additional $143,300,000 for both--
            (1) the initial Federal share of the cost of 
        developing and implementing that portion of an 
        ecosystem protection plan for the Bay-Delta, referred 
        to as ``the Category III program'' emanating out of the 
        document entitled ``Principles for Agreement on Bay-
        Delta Standards Between the State of California and the 
        Federal Government'', dated December 15, 1994, and
            (2) the initial Federal share of the cost of 
        developing and implementing the ecosystem restoration 
        elements of the long-term CALFED Bay-Delta Program, 
        pursuant to the cost sharing agreement required by 
        section 78684.10 of California Senate Bill 900, Chapter 
        135, Statutes of 1996, signed by the Governor of 
        California on July 11, 1996.

Funds appropriated pursuant to this section shall remain 
available until expended and shall be administered in 
accordance with procedures established by CALFED Bay-Delta 
Program until Congress authorizes another entity that is 
recommended by CALFED Bay-Delta Program to carry out this 
section.
    (b) Treatment of Funds.--Funds authorized to be 
appropriated pursuant to this section to those agencies that 
are currently or subsequently become participants in the CALFED 
Bay-Delta Program shall be in addition to the baseline funding 
levels established pursuant to subsection (e), for currently 
authorized projects and programs under the Central Valley 
Project Improvement Act (title XXXIV of Public Law 102-575) and 
other currently authorized Federal programs for the purpose of 
Bay-Delta ecosystem protection and restoration.
    (c) Long-term Solution.--Nothing in this section shall be 
deemed to diminish the Federal interest in and responsibility 
for working with the State of California through the CALFED 
Bay-Delta Program in developing, funding, and implementing a 
balanced, long-term solution to the problems of ecosystem 
quality, water quality, water supply and reliability, and 
system vulnerability affecting the San Francisco Bay/
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Watershed in California. 
Participation in such long term solution shall only be 
undertaken pursuant to authorization provided by law other than 
this section, and shall be based on the equitable allocation of 
program costs among beneficiary groups that the CALFED Bay-
Delta programs shall develop.
    (d) Activities.--To the extent not otherwise authorized, 
those agencies and departments that are currently or 
subsequently become participants in the CALFED Bay-Delta 
Program are hereby authorized to undertake the activities and 
programs for which Federal cost sharing is provided by this 
section. The United States shall immediately initiate 
coordinated consultations and negotiations with the State of 
California to expeditiously execute the cost-sharing agreement 
required by section 78684.10 of California Senate Bill 900, 
Chapter 135, Statutes of 1996, signed by the Governor of 
California on July 11, 1996. Such activities shall include, but 
not be limited to, planning, design, technical assistance, and 
construction for ecosystem restoration programs and projects.
    (e) Budget Crosscut.--The Office of Management and Budget 
is directed to submit to the House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations, as part of the President's Fiscal Year 1998 
Budget, an interagency budget crosscut that displays Federal 
spending for fiscal years 1993 through 1998 on ecosystem 
restoration and other purposes in the Bay-Delta region, 
separately showing funding provided previously or requested 
under both pre-existing authorities and new authorities granted 
by this section.
    (f) Effective Date.--Subsections (a) through (d) of this 
section shall take effect on the date of passage of California 
State Proposition 204.

                                   James V. Hansen,
                                   Wayne Allard,
                                   J.D. Hayworth,
                                   Barbara Cubin,
                                 Managers on the Part of the House.

                                   Frank H. Murkowski,
                                   Pete V. Domenici,
                                   Don Nickles,
                                   J. Bennett Johnston,
                                Managers on the Part of the Senate.
       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The Managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1296) to provide 
for the administration of certain Presidio properties at 
minimal cost to the Federal taxpayer, submit the following 
joint statement to the House and the Senate in explanation of 
the effect of the action agreed upon by the managers and 
recommended in the accompanying conference report:
      The Senate amendment struck all of the House bill after 
the enacting clause and inserted a substitute text.
      The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the Senate with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
House bill and the Senate amendment.

                   Title I: Presidio of San Francisco

      Title I is very similar to H.R. 1296 passed by the House 
and described in House Report 104-202. The Managers have made a 
number of relatively small refinements to the language as 
passed.
      Perhaps most importantly, the Managers have clarified 
that all lands within the Presidio will remain within the 
boundary of Golden Gate National Recreation Area, even after 
formation of the Presidio Trust. This location within a unit of 
the National Park System is expected to have a strong influence 
on the future management of the area.
      The Managers have made adjustments to the language 
regarding the transition of the Presidio from management by the 
National Park Service to management by the Presidio Trust. 
Those adjustments include clarification of how previously 
appropriated funds would be handled, how current employees of 
the National Park Service would be dealt with, and the manner 
in which the National Park Service would continue to oversee 
certain ongoing activities, particularly construction projects. 
In addition, the Managers have provided guidance with respect 
to the transfer of personal property. The Managers are aware 
that the National Park Service inherited a substantial amount 
of personal property from the Army when they departed. In fact, 
there was so much personal property transferred that some of 
the equipment has already been transferred to other park units 
in the Bay area. The Managers have therefore specified that 
personal property received by the National Park Service should 
be transferred to the Trust for their ongoing management of the 
property, rather than remain with the National Park Service.
      The Managers have provided for the U.S. Park Police to 
provide for continued law enforcement presence at the Presidio. 
Currently, the National Park Service has both park rangers and 
park police performing such services; and the Managers concur 
with the position of the Senate that the park police are best 
suited to carry out this function.
      The Managers have agreed to provide reasonable 
flexibility to the Trust in terms of compliance with Federal 
procurement laws. The flexibility provided to the Trust in this 
legislation is consistent with overall efforts by both the 
Administration and the Congress to reduce the administrative 
burden of procurement laws.
      Finally, the Managers have agreed to extend the timeframe 
for providing federal funding to the Trust from 12 to 15 years. 
While analysis conducted by the Trust indicates that it is 
feasible to eliminate the need for Federal funds in 12 years, 
extending such authority for 15 years provides a greater level 
of assurance of success for the Trust. In recognition of the 
overall level of funding which will still be required to 
implement this legislation, as well as in the interest of 
charting the progress of this relatively unique partnership, 
the Managers have agreed to a strong commitment on behalf of 
the General Accounting Office to provide oversight and feedback 
to the Congress.

                              Section 211

      The Managers agreed to modify the language pertaining to 
the expansion of Colonial National Historical Park as passed by 
the House in H.R. 1091 by deleting the limitation on land 
acquisition. The acquisition methods agreed to by Managers are 
typical of park expansion legislation.

      For an explanation of the text see House Report 104-176 
(H.R. 1091).

                              Section 218

      The Managers agreed to certain changes in language 
pertaining to the establishment of Shenandoah National Park as 
contained in the House-passed version of H.R. 1091. While the 
boundary of the park is established to consist of lands in 
Federal ownership as of the date of enactment of the provision, 
the Secretary is provided additional flexibility in making 
future minor boundary adjustments at the park. The original 
House version of H.R. 1091 permitted future minor boundary 
adjustments only where essential to facilitate trailhead 
access. The Managers agreed to permit minor boundary 
adjustments where the Secretary determines it would further the 
purposes of the park. H.R. 1091 as passed by the House limited 
the methods for future boundary adjustments to donation only, 
while the Managers agreed to permit such adjustments by 
donation, exchange or acquisition from willing sellers. The 
Managers also agreed to direct the National Park Service to 
undertake a comprehensive boundary study, which would guide all 
future boundary modifications after its completion.

                              Section 219

      The purpose of this provision is to validate certain 
conveyances made by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company 
within the city of Tulare, California.
      From 1862 through 1871, Congress adopted the Pacific 
Railroad Acts (The Charter Acts) to establish a system of 
railroads in the western United States. The Charter Acts gave 
railroads a right-of-way to strips of land 200 feet wide on 
each side of the railroad tracks where the tracks were laid 
along routes established in the Charter Acts.
      The right-of-way for the railroad tracks and a strip 200 
feet wide on either side within the Downtown Redevelopment Area 
of the City of Tulare (Railroad Right-of-Way) was granted to 
the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California and the 
Southern Pacific Railroad Company under the Charter Acts in 
1862.
      Currently, the Railroad Rights-of-Way through Tulare are 
an active and essential part of the railroad corridor. There is 
only a remote possibility that the railroad tracks through 
downtown Tulare will ever be abandoned; however, that 
possibility means title to eight parcels of land is somewhat 
clouded and could be impaired or lost. Congressional action is 
the only relief to clear title to the eight parcels.
      The Managers have agreed to correct the problem by 
validating and confirming title to the eight parcels in 
accordance with 43 U.S.C. 912. On seven previous occasions, 
Congress has validated similar conveyances under the same 
authority.

      The City of Greeley, Colorado and the Water Supply and 
Storage Company operate eight reservoirs in the Roosevelt 
National Forest in Colorado. This provision would provide the 
framework for the agreement that has been reached between the 
United States Forest Service and the City of Greeley and Water 
Supply and Storage.
      The agreement has been negotiated over the last twelve 
months and would provide for the Forest Service with 708 acres 
of land to improve the administration of the Roosevelt National 
Forest. Some of this land is within the boundaries of Federally 
designated Wilderness Areas.

                              Section 312

      The Conference Committee has adopted language which could 
lead to a major expansion of the Gates of the Arctic National 
Park and Preserve and to significant additions to the Maritime 
National Wildlife Refuge and other conservation system units in 
Alaska. These expansions would be made if mutually agreeable 
land exchanges are negotiated by the Secretary of the Interior 
with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) and the State 
of Alaska. In return for conveying to the United States title 
to lands long sought for addition to the Park and other 
conservation units, ASRC and the State could receive title to 
lands located within the 23 million acre National Petroleum 
Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A).

Black Revolutionary War Patriots is an important effort. 
Further, it is the understanding of the Managers that the fund 
raising effort for the memorial is now well underway and 
therefore the Managers have agreed that an additional two year 
extension of this authority to complete such fundraising 
efforts is meritorious.

                              Section 509

      The authorization for the Advisory Council on Historic 
Preservation is scheduled to expire at the end of the current 
fiscal year. The Managers are aware that under the current 
Section 106 process for implementation of the National Historic 
Preservation Act, the Advisory Council plays an important role 
in assessing and mitigating the impacts of Federal actions on 
significant historic properties. The Managers are also aware 
that in the recent past, the Advisory Council has attempted to 
promulgate regulations which could have led to significant 
increases in the cost of compliance with the National Historic 
Preservation Act, and which would have provided little 
additional benefit in terms of resource protection. While the 
Advisory Council has subsequently withdrawn those regulations 
in the face of overwhelming public opposition, the Managers 
remain concerned about the nature of final regulations to be 
adopted.
      The Managers agreed to a four-year extension of the 
authorization of the Advisory Council, but within that time 
frame have directed that the Council provide recommendations 
for modifying the overly complex historic preservation 
compliance process. In particular, the Managers are seeking 
alternative ways to carry out the Historic Preservation Act 
which will be less burdensome on both the public and private 
sectors.
      The Managers have also agreed on a number of technical 
amendments which are needed to improve the day-to-day 
operations of the Advisory Council.

Richmond National Battlefield Park
            Subsection a: Findings and purposes
      This subsection establishes the findings and purposes. 
Congress finds that the boundaries of the Richmond National 
Battlefield Park do not include all of the historically 
significant areas important to the Civil War campaigns in and 
around the City of Richmond which served as the capital of the 
Confederacy.
      The purposes of this section are to establish a revised 
boundary for the park to consist of the lands currently in 
Federal ownership and to provide for procedures for the 
National Park Service to expand the boundaries.
            Subsection b: Modification of boundary
      This subsection designates the boundary of the park to 
comprise those lands in Federal ownership and administered by 
the National Park Service before the date of enactment of this 
legislation.
            Subsection c: Land acquisition
      This subsection authorizes the Secretary to expand the 
boundaries of the park to include those lands identified in the 
general management plan for the park approved in June 1996 and 
depicted on the National Park Service map dated August 1993. 
The Secretary may acquire lands for addition to the park by 
donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds or 
exchange with the consent of the land owner. Upon acquisition 
of any lands by the Secretary, the park boundary is modified to 
include those lands without further action by Congress.
            Subsection d: Park management and administration
      This subsection directs the Secretary to interpret for 
the benefit of the public the significance of the Battles of 
Richmond on the Civil War and the effects of the Civil War on 
all American people. To further the interpretation and 
preservation of the historic resources of the park identified 
in the general management plan, the Secretary is directed to 
provide technical assistance and to enter into cooperative 
agreements with local governments, nonprofit organizations and 
land owners. The Secretary is also authorized to provide 
technical assistance to local governments, nonprofit 
organizations and land owners to protect and preserve 
historically significant Civil War resources located outside of 
the boundary of the park.
            Subsection e: Administration
      This subsection clarifies that Richmond National 
Battlefield Park is to be managed in accord with the Historic 
Sites Act of 1935.

Title 607. Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National Historic District
            Subsection (a.): Short title
      This subsection entitles this section as the Shenandoah 
Valley National Battlefields National Historic District 
comprising 10 Civil War battlefields in Virginia's Shenandoah 
Valley.
            Subsection (b.): Congressional findings
      In 1990, Congress enacted the Civil War Sites Study Act 
(section 1204 of Public Law 101-628). That law directed the 
Secretary of the Interior to prepare a study of Civil War sites 
within the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. The study was 
completed in September 1992, and transmitted to Congress in 
summer of 1993.
      The study notes that ``the battlefields identified in 
this study collectively appear to meet criteria for national 
significance. The study shows that the Shenandoah Valley 
represents a unique geographic and historic resource: that it 
possesses tremendous scenic beauty and exceptional potential 
for interpreting aspects of the Civil War that are currently 
not represented in the National Park System; . . . and that 
many portions of the Valley retain a high degree of historic, 
rural, and scenic integrity.''
      The study identifies the historical significance of the 
battles in the Valley associated with Confederate General 
Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson's campaign of 1862 and the 
decisive Union campaigns of 1864 led by Union General Philip 
Sheridan.
            Subsection (c.): Statement of purposes
      Until recently, most of the Shenandoah Valley had 
remained in the same type of agricultural use since the Civil 
War. However, increasing development within the Valley has 
begun to threaten the integrity of many of these battlefield 
sites. This subsection sets forth the purposes of the Historic 
District to provide a coordinated strategy for protection 
involving the National Park Service, the Commonwealth of 
Virginia, local governments, private organizations and land 
owners.
      Partnerships between all levels of government, private 
landowners and non-profit organizations will foster the 
protection of the natural, cultural, and historic resources 
within the historic district linking the battlefields.
            Subsection (d.): Definitions
      This subsection defines certain key terms used in this 
section.
            Subsection (e.): Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National 
                    Historic District
      This subsection establishes the Shenandoah Valley 
Battlefields National Historic District consisting of lands 
identified in the Park Service study, the battlefield areas 
identified on the National Park Service map at Cedar Creek, 
Cross Keys, Fisher's Hill, McDowell, New Market, Opequon, Port 
Republic, Second Kernstown, Second Winchester, and Tom's Brook, 
and the historic transportation routes linking these 
battlefields.
            Subsection (f.): Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National 
                    Historic District Plan
      This subsection provides that the District is to be 
managed by the Commission and the management entity pursuant to 
this Act and the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Historic 
District Plan (the ``plan''), pursuant to this section.
      It also sets forth the specific provisions of the plan, 
including the development of an inventory of lands that should 
be acquired, managed or preserved because of its historical 
significance; provisions for the establishment of a management 
entity which may be either a unit of government or a private 
nonprofit organization; identification of partnerships between 
state, local and regional entities and the private sector; and, 
provisions for the protection and interpretation of natural, 
cultural and historic resources in the Historic District.
      The purpose of the management entity is to administer the 
District consistent with the plan. The management entity would 
have legal ability to receive and disburse Federal funds, enter 
into agreements with all levels of governments or organizations 
to provide for the implementation of the plan, and to acquire 
lands from willing sellers for the purposes of preserving the 
historic resources in the District.
      This subsection directs the Commission to prepare a draft 
plan within 3 years. The Commission is required to ensure that 
appropriate notice of the draft plan is provided to local 
communities.
      It also requires that the Secretary review the plan and 
within 90 days after receiving the plan, either approve it or 
reject the plan and recommend modifications that would make the 
plan acceptable.
            Subsection (g.): Duties of the Secretary
      This subsection authorizes the Secretary to award grants, 
provide technical assistance and enter into cooperative 
agreements with local governments, property owners and 
nonprofit organizations to preserve and interpret the historic 
resources in the District.
      The Secretary may acquire land from a willing seller that 
has been identified by the Commission as important to the 
preservation of battlefields within the District.
      The Secretary is directed, upon request of the 
Commission, to detail two employees of the Department of the 
Interior to the Commission to assist with the preparation of 
the plan.
      Following the approval of the plan, the Secretary is to 
report to Congress on whether the Historic District or specific 
components should be added as units of the National Park 
System.
            Subsection (h.): Shenandoah Valley Battlefields National 
                    Heritage Corridor Commission
      This subsection establishes the Shenandoah Valley 
National Battlefields Historic District Commission (the 
``Commission'') consisting of 19 members. The Commission is to 
be composed of local governments, property owners, a member 
with expertise in historic preservation, a Civil War historian, 
and the Governor of Virginia and the Director of the National 
Park Service, in an ex-officio capacity.
            Subsection (I.): Duties of the Commission
      The duties of the Commission are the development of the 
plan; assisting in the management, protection and 
interpretation of the natural, cultural and historical 
resources within the District; and, taking appropriate action 
to encourage protection of the resources within the District by 
landowners, local governments, and other organizations.
            Section (j.): Authorization of appropriations
      This subsection authorizes the appropriation of $250,000 
annually from the amounts available to carry out the National 
Historic Preservation Act for the establishment and operation 
of the Commission.
      There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary 
$2,000,000 annually from the National Historic Preservation Act 
to make grants, provide technical assistance and enter into 
cooperative agreements pursuant to Section 7.
      For the purposes of land acquisition within the Historic 
District, $2,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated from the 
National Historic Preservation Act pursuant to Section 7(d).
      A total of $500,000 annually is authorized to be 
appropriated from the National Historic Preservation Act for 
the establishment and operation of the management entity.

                            Title VII: Fees

                              Section 701

      For an explanation of the text see House Report 104-516 
part I (HR 1527).

                              Section 702

      For an explanation of the text see House Report 104-57 
(HR 536).

                              Section 703

      The Managers agree that many provisions of the existing 
recreation fee policy, as provided in Section 4 of the Land and 
Water Conservation Act are outdated and unworkable. The 
Managers have therefore agreed that current law should be 
replaced in its entirety. The policy adopted by the Managers is 
similar to the recreation fee policy contained in HR 2107 as 
reported by the House Resources Committee. However, the 
Managers have agreed to include a number of limitations on fee 
increases, similar to those included in the Balanced Budget Act 
which was vetoed by the President.
      The inclusion of caps in the legislation is probably one 
of the biggest changes to the fee policy reported by the House 
Resources Committee. The Managers have agreed to caps of $10 
per person or $25 per car for single admission visits, $25 for 
annual geographic permits and $50 for Golden Eagle Passports. 
The Managers have also provided that Golden Eagle Passports 
would be available to persons 62 years of age or older for no 
more than 50 percent of the rate charged for other persons. In 
addition, the Managers have agreed that all children 12 and 
under should be charged no admission fee. The Managers have 
included language which provides that increases in fees will be 
implemented over a reasonable period of time in order to 
minimize rapid escalation of fees charged to recreation users. 
The Managers do not anticipate that agencies will begin to 
immediately charge fees as provided for in this legislation at 
the maximum allowable rate.
      The Managers have agreed to limit the scope of this 
provision to the National Park Service, Bureau of Land 
Management and Forest Service only, at this time. The Managers 
recognize that over the long term, it is desirable for the 
public to have a single recreation fee policy for all Federal 
lands. However, since other agencies have recreation fee 
authority conformance is not essential at this time. The 
Managers expect that other such agencies will undertake no 
program inconsistent with this provision, unless otherwise 
specifically provided in law.
      The Managers have also simplified the recreation fee 
program as contained in HR 2107. Specifically, the Managers 
have agreed to delete target recreation revenue goals, delete 
appropriation language and simplify the calculation of how much 
revenue should be retained by each of the collecting areas.
       The Managers have included in the text the current fee 
schedule for admission fees for commercial tour operators. The 
Managers recognize that in some cases agencies may already be 
charging rates higher than those specifically included in this 
text, but does not intend in any way to imply that current fees 
schedules should be modified. Rather, the Managers intend 
simply that future increases in such commercial tour entry fees 
be in accord with the provisions of this section.
       The Managers recognize that the four land management 
agencies were recently authorized under the FY 96 Interior 
Appropriation Act (Public Law 104-134) to implement recreation 
fee demonstration programs. Unfortunately, none of the agencies 
with this authority, except the Forest Service, have elected to 
implement it. Therefore, in order to develop a consistent 
policy, this legislation repeals that authority for all 
agencies except the Forest Service.

                              Section 704

      This section provides for the protection of the natural 
resources of Glacier Bay National Park by the Secretary of the 
Interior while preserving the authority of other Federal 
agencies to enforce environmental laws under their authority in 
the Park. The Secretary of the Interior issues permits and 
charges fees to concessionaires in the Glacier Bay National 
Park, including cruise ships. The fees collected by the 
Secretary be used to protect Park resources within the Park. 
Therefore, this section provides that 60 percent of the fees 
charged to certain permittees be used by the Secretary to 
protect park resources, including prepositioned oil spill 
prevention equipment.
       In addition, the Committee on Conference is concerned 
that recent rulemakings by the Secretary of the Interior 
regarding permit conditions for park concessionaires appear to 
overstep the authority of the Secretary and usurp the authority 
of other Federal agencies, such as the Coast Guard and the 
Environmental Protection Agency, to enforce the Oil Pollution 
Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Clean Air 
Act. Accordingly, this provision limits the authority of the 
Secretary to condition permits, including permits for vessel 
operations, in the Park.
       Finally, the Committee is concerned that the permit 
conditions being considered by the Secretary be based on 
substantial, verifiable scientific information. Therefore, this 
section allows permit fees to be used for further scientific 
investigations to help the Secretary to develop appropriate and 
justified permit conditions to protect Glacier Bay National 
Park resources.

(S. 509).

                              Section 815

      The Managers agreed to a broad array of administrative 
reforms for the National Park Service as generally provided by 
H.R. 2941 (see House Report 104-802, Part I). However, the 
Managers did agree to make changes to the language from H.R. 
2941 pertaining to both housing and construction of 
administrative facilities outside of the boundaries of park 
areas.
      The most significant change to the housing authority is 
the elimination of the authority to sell government housing to 
cooperatives consisting of field employees. While Managers 
agree that this provision has merit, they also agree that there 
are potential problems and have therefore agreed to a study of 
such a program prior to its authorization. The Managers have 
also agreed to direct the Secretary to refine the concept of 
required occupancy. The Managers have found evidence that this 
concept is not applied uniformly and believe that employees who 
are required to occupy government quarters due to isolation 
deserve similar treatment regardless of occupation.
      The Managers deleted the generic authority for the 
National Park Service to construct facilities outside of park 
boundaries on non-federal land and substituted the site-
specific authority for such construction at Zion National Park. 
The Managers are aware of several similar proposals currently 
receiving congressional consideration. However, the Managers 
generally believe that park facilities should be located in the 
park, and that other federal leasing authorities are generally 
adequate to provide needed building space outside the parks. It 
is the conclusion of the Managers that the need for facilities 
outside of park boundaries should continue to be evaluated on a 
case-by-case basis.

                              Section 816

      Section 816 is based on legislation passed by the House 
Resources Committee (H.R. 3534) which authorizes the National 
Park Service to continue to issue special use permits to cabin 
owners at Mineral King in Sequoia National Park, after the 
death of the permittee of record.
      There is no accurate count of persons living within areas 
designated by Congress as units of the national park system, 
either on private property or on Federally-owned property. For 
example, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore reports that at one 
point, there were over 700 use and occupancy agreements at that 
park alone.
      Individuals currently reside inside parks under three 
basic sets of conditions. The first is on private property 
within the park boundary which has not yet been acquired by the 
Federal government. The second is when property has been 
acquired by the Federal government under terms of a use and 
occupancy agreement. The third is when the Federal government 
permits persons to reside on Federal lands.
      Since 1972, acquisition of Federal lands has been guided 
by the Uniform Relocation and Assistance Act. That law 
generally provides for the government to authorize the lease 
back of an improved residence which has been acquired, for up 
to 25 years or the life of the occupant, depending on any 
limitations contained in the specific authorizing statute. For 
example, if the Federal government is acquiring the area for 
road construction purposes, the resident would typically not be 
offered a lifetime estate. The homeowner pays for this extended 
use of the property through a reduction in the purchase price 
paid by the government. These persons have a property right 
which is reflected as a use and occupancy agreement. Such use 
of the property can be bought and sold.
      In the 1970's, when the Federal government was acquiring 
extensive lands for park purposes, it has been alleged that 
some of the acquisition was heavy-handed. It is unclear whether 
residents were fully advised of their rights, and there were a 
number of bitter land acquisition disputes across the park 
system. Congress has addressed this issue at least once before, 
when an Act was passed which permitted residents of Minute Man 
National Historic Park to extend their original use and 
occupancy agreements (Public Law 102-488).
      The history of the National Park Service permitting 
persons to use park lands for residential purposes is less 
clear. Typically these situations arise due to prevailing 
conditions at the time of park establishment. However, there 
has been a wide discrepancy among parks with regard to how any 
generic authority is interpreted. Some park superintendents 
claim they have no authority to permit such non-park 
residential use of the land, while others have seen no problem 
with the issuance of special use permits for residential 
purposes.
       Mineral King was Forest Service land added to Sequoia-
Kings Canyon National Park in the 1970's in order to prevent 
Disney from developing a ski area. When the land was added, 
there were a number of residents within the addition; both 
persons who owned their property and persons who occupied 
cabins under a special use permit from the Forest Service. The 
legislation establishing the area stated that such ``special 
use'' permits would only be issued to the owner or lessee of 
record at the time. Now, nearly 20 years after enactment of the 
original law, some original owners have died and their heirs 
are seeking to continue their permits.
      This provision amends the 1978 statute adding the Mineral 
King area to Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park by specifically 
authorizing the National Park Service to issue cabin leases to 
the heirs of the original permittees of record until the death 
of the last permittee of record.
      The language of the bill requires permittees to pay fair 
market value for such use, and specifically provides for 
protection of park resources and termination of the use if 
lands are needed for other purposes. The legislation provides 
that the Secretary must have the funds to implement such 
alternative use, rather than simply prepare a plan calling for 
such use. The Managers do not believe that these persons should 
be forced out of their cabins until such alternative use is a 
reality.

                              Section 817

      Language is self-explanatory.

                              Section 818

      This section directs the Secretary of the Interior to 
conduct a study of the Lake Calumet area to analyze alternative 
ways to manage the area.

                              Section 819

      This section provides for a legislative taking of the 
balance of private property in the Gherini Ranch on Santa Cruz 
Island in Channel Islands National Park. The National Park 
Service currently owns a three-fourths undivided interest in 
the Gherini Ranch, which is a 6,200-acre parcel located on the 
east end of Santa Cruz Island. This parcel of land is currently 
being severely impacted by uncontrolled populations of feral 
sheep. While the Federal government has acquired three 
undivided one-fourth interest portions of this ranch on a 
willing seller basis, there is little hope of the Federal 
government reaching agreement with the remaining property owner 
regarding the value of the land. Therefore, in order to bring 
an end to overgrazing, and resultant impacts on park resources, 
including irreversible destruction of archeological sites, the 
Managers support this legislative taking.

                        Title IX: Heritage Areas

                              Section 901

      For an explanation of the text see Senate Report 104-42 
(S. 601).

                              Section 902

      The language is self-explanatory. The Managers agreed to 
direct the Administration to study the area.

                         Title X: Miscellaneous

                               SUBTITLE A

      The conference agreement includes language to create a 
tallgrass prairie national preserve in the Flint Hills of 
Kansas. The preserve will be created through a unique private/
public partnership between the federal government and a private 
conservation group. The partnership is the culmination of 
decades of discussions between agriculture and conservation 
interests who, until now, have disagreed over issues such as 
federal ownership and cattle grazing as part of a tallgrass 
prairie preserve in Kansas. The language drafted in this 
legislation is the result of consensus building and compromise 
between these various groups.
      While the conference agreement only provides for federal 
ownership, by donation, of 180 acres of land on the preserve, 
it is hoped that the National Park Service, through the 
cooperative agreement language contained in this bill, will be 
able to work with the private land owners (and its leasee) of 
the rest of the 10,894-acre ranch to provide interpretive and 
recreation opportunities within the boundaries of the preserve, 
but beyond the federally owned-core.
      The stated purposes of this bill remain broad to give the 
National Park Service maximum flexibility in determining land 
use practices within the preserve through the general 
management planning process, with input from an advisory 
committee created by this bill. We believe a public planning 
process, with input from all Kansans, including local citizens 
and adjacent landowners, will enable the National Park Service 
to identify the best use for the 180 federally-owned acres, and 
provide guidance for possible cooperative agreements between 
the federal government and the private owner and its leasee.
      The conferees note that the Kansas congressional 
delegation is united in its belief that a strong emphasis of 
the preserve should include the management of range lands 
through historic and contemporary ranching practices. While the 
conferees are unwilling to include language in the act that 
would require any predetermined use of private property 
mentioned within this bill, the conferees agree with the Kansas 
congressional delegation that current cattle ranching 
activities, consistent with the ecologically sound and 
sustainable management of this property, should continue after 
the preserve is created. Cattle ranching, as practiced under 
the current grazing lease, is consistent with the 
interpretation of the history and culture of the Flint Hills 
region of the tallgrass prairie.

                               SUBTITLE B

      The language is self-explanatory.

                               SUBTITLE C

                              Section 1021

      This provision establishes a national recreation area, 
changes the designation of the black canyon of the Gunnison 
National Monument to a National Park, and designates a new BLM 
conservation area on the Lower Black Canyons.
      The conferees intend that all agencies operating within 
the newly designated complex share personnel, supplies, 
materials and equipment to the extent practicable for a more 
efficient and effective overall operation.

                              Section 1022

      See Senate Report 104-299 (S. 1703) for background 
information. Miscellaneous amendments were added to protect the 
integrity of the park system.

(HR 2711).

                              Section 1036

      The language is self-explanatory.

                              Section 1037

      Despite Alaska's stature as the largest State in the 
Union and the millions of acres of federal lands in the State, 
Alaska ranks 10th in Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) receipts. 
This is because the definition of ``unit of local government'' 
includes only organized boroughs and certain independent cities 
in Alaska. Yet over 60 percent of the federal lands in Alaska 
are located outside any organized borough.
      This section will not increase the current entitlement 
ceiling of PILT, it will only change the way the PILT fund is 
divided by providing a small additional share of the PILT fund 
distribution to those Alaskan communities that are outside 
unorganized boroughs. The legislation also will not reduce 
other states PILT funding significantly because PILT 
calculations also include population statistics.

                              Section 1038

      The conferees have included bill language that prohibits 
termination of a timber sale contract solely for failure to 
operate a pulp mill. This provision is necessary to provide 
flexibility to the Administration so that jobs in the sawmill 
portion of the contract holder's operation are not lost along 
with pulp mill jobs. The Forest Service shall work with the 
contract holder to make any excess volume available to sawmills 
in Southeast Alaska closed for lack of timber.

                              Section 1039

      This provision directs the Secretary of the Interior to 
undertake a negotiation with several Alaska Native Corporations 
in the Cook Inlet region of Alaska to resolve disagreements 
over final land conveyances to the Native Corporations under 
the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The Secretary is 
required to report to the relevant authorizing committees the 
results of the negotiation by March 1, 1997. To facilitate the 
negotiation, the amendment extends a statute of limitations 
which could be interpreted as requiring the filing of a suit by 
the corporations against the Secretary for failure to convey 
lands described in the Deficiency Agreement of August 31, 1976.

                              Section 1040

      This section authorizes the Native residents of the 
Southeast Alaska Native villages of Haines, Ketchikan, 
Petersburg, Tenakee and Wrangell to organize as urban or group 
corporations under an amendment to the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA). ANCSA authorized the creation 
of village, urban and regional corporations to receive 
settlements and manage assets distributed to settle aboriginal 
claims of Natives and Native groups in Alaska. The original 
ANCSA language failed to include the Native villages of Haines, 
Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee or Wrangell in the exclusive 
list of villages in Southeast Alaska eligible to create village 
or urban corporation. Unlike the treatment of other Native 
villages elsewhere in Alaska, ANCSA did not provide an appeal 
right or other procedures for qualification of Southeast Native 
villages not included in the original list. Although Natives 
enrolled to Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee and Wrangell 
during the ANCSA process did become at-large shareholders in 
the regional corporation for Southeast Alaska, Natives from 
these five communities were denied the benefits from rights to 
land and local resources that other village and urban 
corporations in Southeast Alaska received under ANCSA.

                              Section 1041

      This section would transfer legal title to approximately 
160 acres of land to Daniel and Douglas Gross. The Gross 
brothers are the surviving sons of Mr. and Mrs. Lee Gross of 
Wrangell, Alaska, the original homesteaders.

                              Section 1042

      For an explanation of the text see House Report 104-687 
(HR 1786).

                              Section 1043

      The Conferees adopted a provision recognizing that in 
1982, Cape Fox Corporation (CFC) selected approximately 320 
acres surrounding the Beaver Falls hydro-project's powerhouse. 
The facility was constructed in 1945 and licensed by the FPC, 
now FERC. It is owned and operated by the City of Ketchikan 
through the Ketchikan Public Utilities. The City of Ketchikan 
protested CFC's selection of the site to the Interior Board of 
Land Appeals (IBLA). The IBLA upheld CFC's selection in a 
decision made in 1983. In this decision IBLA essentially ruled 
that the City could continue to operate the hydro facility 
under the terms of Section 14(g) of ANCSA until their license 
expired in 1995. At license expiration, use of the land by the 
City would be subject to acquisition of a real property 
interest from CFC.
      A FERC order dated November 7, 1994, issuing the ``new'' 
license for this facility, Project No. 1922-008, includes a 
clause that directs the City to pay all land use fees including 
use of CFC land to the federal government. The effect of this 
decision removes CFC's property rights, which deprive CFC of 
its ability to make economic use of its land. The FERC order 
also creates a conflict between two federal agencies, IBLA and 
FERC.
      This section grants authority for CFC to return the 320 
acre Beaver Falls selection area to the federal government and 
expands CFC's selection area accordingly.

                              Section 1044

      The conferees have included bill language requiring the 
Secretary to report to the relevant committees of the House and 
Senate on a determination of whether the continued presence of 
a small antenna at an existing radio communications site barely 
within the San Bernardino National Forest at Inspiration Point 
is in the public interest. The conferees regret the need to 
direct that such a report, given the overwhelming community 
support for continued presence of the antenna, is necessary for 
public safety and emergency broadcasts.

                              Section 1045

      Between 1931 and 1954 local sporting enthusiasts and back 
country users built and constructed a series of 18 dams and 
concrete weirs throughout the area which later came to be known 
as the Immigrant Wilderness Area. These dams were built from 
native rock so as to blend in naturally with their 
surroundings, most of these dams do not exceed two feet in 
height. The last dam was built 20 years before wilderness 
designation was considered for the area.
      Report language for H.R. 12884 which established the 
Immigrant Wilderness Area indicated that ``the weirs and small 
dams will be retained.'' Inclusion of this provision in the 
conference report to preserve these dams will maintain 
traditional wilderness and recreation uses.

                              Section 1046

      This provision concerns a longstanding inequity affecting 
the University of Alaska, the State's only federal land grant 
institution of higher learning. The University was established 
in 1890. However, because of Alaska's territorial status, it 
did not benefit from the original Morrill School Lands Act, 
which only benefited states. Congress sought to address this 
problem in 1915 and 1929 through legislation which reserved 
certain public lands in Alaska for the benefit of the 
University. Unfortunately, the University has as of today 
received less than one-third of the acres it was entitled to 
receive from the federal government. As a result, even though 
Alaska is the largest of the fifty states, it ranks 48th in 
terms of land devoted to higher education. This language begins 
to address both of these problems by authorizing the Secretary 
of the Interior to convey up to 350,000 acres of federal lands, 
on a matching basis with the State of Alaska, to the 
University.

        Title XI: California Bay-Delta Environmental Enhancement

      The Managers agreed to the inclusion of this proposal 
which will authorize $430 million for fiscal years 1998 through 
2000 for ecosystem protection and restoration in the San 
Francisco Bay-Delta region. These funds will represent the 
three-year federal match of state funds allocated in accordance 
with California Proposition 204. This provision is only 
effective if the corresponding state proposition 204 is adopted 
by the voters in November of 1996. If passed, the corresponding 
state proposition would provide $995 million in state dollars 
for the program.
