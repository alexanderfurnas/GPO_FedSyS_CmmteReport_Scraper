    Under Rules adopted by the House of Representatives for the

also referred to as Committee) jurisdiction (See Rule X, clause 
1 of the Rules of the House of Representatives) extended to--
          (1) Adulteration of seeds, insect pests, and

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ ``Seafood and seafood products'', item 14 and ``water 
conservation related to activities of the Department of Agriculture'' 
were added to Rule X, clause 1 in the 104th Congress (see House 
Document No. 103-342).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The revised edition of the Rules and Manual of the House of 
Representatives for the 104th Congress (House Document No. 103-
342) provides the following concerning the Committee on 
Agriculture: \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ References are to the volume and section of Hinds' (volumes I-
V, e.g., IV, 500) and Cannon's (volumes VI-VIII, e.g., VI, 400) 
Precedents of the House of Representatives, and to the Congressional 
Record by date and page (e.g., January 3, 1953, p. 500).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
          This Committee was established in 1820 (IV, 4149). In 
        1880 the subject of forestry was added to its 
        jurisdiction, and the Committee was conferred authority 
        to receive estimates of and to report appropriations 
        (IV, 4149). However, on July 1, 1920, authority to 
        report appropriations for the U.S. Department of 
        Agriculture (hereinafter also referred to as USDA) was 
        transferred to the Committee on Appropriations (VII, 
        1860).
          The basic form of the present jurisdictional 
        statement was made effective January 2, 1947, as a part 
        of the Legislative Reorganization of Act of 1946 (60 
        Stat. 812). Subparagraph (7) was altered by the 93d 
        Congress, effective January 3, 1975, to include 
        jurisdiction over agricultural commodities (including 
        the Commodity Credit Corporation) while transferring 
        jurisdiction over foreign distribution and nondomestic 
        production of commodities to the Committee on 
        International Relations (H. Res. 988, 93d Cong., Oct 8, 
        1974, p. 34470). Nevertheless, the Committee has 
        retained a limited jurisdiction over measures to 
        release CCC stocks for such foreign distribution (Sept. 
        14, 1989, p. 20428). Previously unstated jurisdictions 
        over commodities exchanges and rural development were 
        codified effective January 3, 1975.
          The 104th Congress consolidated the Committee's 
        jurisdiction over food inspection to include inspection 
        of seafood and seafood products, and added subparagraph 
        (20) relating to water conservation (sec. 202(a), H. 
        Res. 6, Jan. 4 1995).
          The Committee has had jurisdiction of bills for 
        establishing and regulating the Department of 
        Agriculture (IV, 4150), for inspection of livestock, 
        poultry and their products, regulation of animal 
        industry, diseases of animals (IV, 4154; VII, 1862), 
        adulteration of seeds, insect pests, protection of 
        birds and animals in forest reserves (IV, 4157; VII, 
        1870), the improvement of the breed of horses, even 
        with the cavalry service in view (IV, 4158; VII, 1865).
          The Committee, having charge of the general subject 
        of forestry, has reported bills relating to timber, and 
        forest reserves other than those created from the 
        public domain (IV, 4160).
          It has also exercised jurisdiction of bills relating 
        to agricultural colleges and experiment stations (IV, 
        4152), incorporation of agricultural societies (IV, 
        4159), establishment of a highway commission (IV, 
        4153), to discourage fictitious and gambling 
        transactions in farm products (IV, 4161; VII, 1861), 
        and to regulate the transportation, sale and handling 
        of dogs and cats intended for use in research and the 
        licensing of animal research facilities (July 29, 1965, 
        p. 18691).
          The Committee has, by direct action of the House, 
        secured jurisdiction of bills imposing an internal-
        revenue tax on oleomargine (IV, 4156), and has also had 
        a general, but not exclusive jurisdiction of bills 
        relating to imitation dairy products, manufacture of 
        lard, etc. (IV, 4156; VII, 1869), and tax on cotton and 
        grain futures (65th Cong.). But this jurisdiction of 
        revenue matters is exceptional (IV, 4155).
          The House referred the President's message dealing 
        with the refinancing of farm-mortgage indebtedness to 
        the Committee, thus conferring jurisdiction (Apr. 4, 
        1933, p. 1209).
          The Committee has exclusive jurisdiction over a bill 
        relating solely to executive level positions in the 
        Department of Agriculture (Mar. 2, 1976, p. 4958) and 
        has jurisdiction over bills to develop land and water 
        conservation programs on private and non-Federal lands 
        (June 7, 1976, p. 16768).
    Some of the specific areas in which the Committee on 
Agriculture exercises its jurisdiction or that have been 
created for the Committee by historical reference include:
          (1) Public Law 480, Eighty-third Congress, the 
        restoration, expansion, and development of foreign

                           C. OVERSIGHT PLAN

    The Committee on Agriculture met on February 7, 1995, and 
again on February 14, 1995 to fulfill the General Oversight 
Responsibility reporting requirements of Rule X 2(d)(1) of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives.
    The following outline was prepared in consultation with the 
Ranking Member and approved by the Full Committee which was 
forwarded to the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight 
on February 15, 1995:


     oversight plan--house committee on agriculture, 104th congress


1995 Farm bill
    The 1990 Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act is 
comprised of 25 separate titles encompassing virtually all of 
the Committee's jurisdiction. The majority of the authorities 
prescribed in the 1990 Act expire at the end of this year. Most 
of the 1995 Calendar will be consumed by Full Committee and 
subcommittee(s) review of the Act in detail to determine which 
authorities need to be renewed, reformed, or eliminated. 
Oversight reviews will be comprised of both field and 
Washington hearings.
Food stamps (welfare reform)
    Both the Full Committee and the Department Operations, 
Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee will be 
conducting extensive hearings on the Food Stamp Program 
relative to the Federal budget, distribution of benefits, 
enforcement actions to protect against fraud and abuse, and to 
consider reforms to ensure the program helps those truly in 
need while also ensuring the wisest use of taxpayers' 
contributions. In addition, the Committee and Subcommittee will 
be reviewing other domestic and foreign food assistance 
programs administered and/or funded by the Department of 
Agriculture.
Property rights on agricultural lands
    The Resource Conservation, Research, and Forestry 
Subcommittee will be looking into the impact of Federal 
regulations on the rights of owners to lawfully use legally 
acquired property. In addition, the Subcommittee expects to 
discuss the ``takings'' issue relative to its full range of 
meaning, from actual Federal acquisition to regulatory actions 
that restrict or prohibit lawful commercial activities that 
affect the value of the property.
Agricultural and rural tax issues
    The General Farm Commodities Subcommittee will conduct a 
hearing to review provisions of the Job Creation and Wage 
Enhancement Act as it relates to agricultural producers, 
specifically on family farming and ranching operations. The 
Subcommittee expects to focus on capital gains and estate tax 
issues that impact rural areas.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
    The Risk Management and Specialty Crops Subcommittee will 
conduct hearings to review legislation to reauthorize the 
authorities and activities of the CFTC. Because of the scope of 
the 1992 Futures Trading Practices Act, the Committee's 
intention is to move forward with the reauthorization as 
expeditiously as possible. Those issues raised during initial 
reauthorization hearings, as well as the ongoing review of the 
1992 Act's reforms, will be the focus of additional oversight 
activities throughout the next two years.
Meat and poultry food safety inspection
    The Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Subcommittee will be 
conducting general oversight reviews/investigations relative to 
the Food Safety Inspection Service's administration of the meat 
and poultry inspection acts, and the Food and Drug 
Administration's food inspection activities, including seafood 
and seafood products inspection. It is also expected that the 
Full Committee will be considering reform proposals--coupled 
with the appropriate oversight--relative to the statutes 
governing U.S. meat and poultry inspection, the relationship 
between State and Federal inspection, and the interaction of 
U.S. food safety statutes relative to international trade.

In addition, the Committee expects to conduct oversight on the 
following general topics/issues. While Committee and 
Subcommittee leadership will be coordinating the oversight 
activities of these issues to make the best possible use of 
Committee resources, they are listed under auspices of the Full 
Committee.

Factors affecting the agricultural economy

    The Federal budget and its impact on U.S. agriculture, 
Federal farm programs, and future agricultural policies.
    The agricultural economy in general.
    U.S. agricultural trade, including review of GATT, NAFTA, 
USDA Foreign Agriculture Service, export assistance/development 
programs, foreign agricultural assistance (P.L. 480, etc.), 
export credit programs, high value product exports, cargo 
preference shipping requirements.
    USDA Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) and related 
programs. In 1994, Congress enacted major changes to FCIC 
insurance programs to ensure against ad hoc disaster 
legislation and improve delivery of protection against weather-
related crop losses. FCIC also is impacted by USDA 
restructuring activities. Oversight is needed to ensure both 
program function and reliable delivery to farmers is 
maintained.
    Producer-funded Research and Promotion Programs (check-
offs). These producer-funded programs have become increasingly 
popular as Federal research, market development, and export 
promotion resources have been cut. Because the funding 
mechanism is mandated by law, and because the Secretary of 
Agriculture is the regulator of these programs, oversight is 
valuable and necessary to ensure their sanctity and viability.
    Commodity marketing systems, market prices (farm, 
wholesale, retail), and general agricultural economic factors. 
The Committee will conduct oversight on commodity marketing/
pricing issues as anomalies in the retail price spread arise. 
One recent example occurred late in 1994 in the pork industry 
when the price differential between what hog producers and 
retailers were receiving for their products was substantially 
outside the norm, prompting a need to investigate.

Environmental statutes and related issues

    Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) 
and related pesticide food safety issues.
    Coastal Zone Management Act as related to agriculture.
    Endangered Species Act as related to agriculture.
    Safe Drinking Water Act relative to regulation of 
agricultural and rural enterprise activities.
    Clean Water Act relative to regulation of agricultural and 
rural enterprise activities.
    USDA Forest Service's management of public lands under its 
jurisdiction, including reviews of grazing and other uses of 
these lands which require user to secure Forest Service permit. 
Current Forest Service administration of certain programs 
appears to be unduly penalizing those who depend on legitimate 
access to Forest Service holdings to ensure the economic 
viability of their enterprises.
    USDA Natural Resources and Conservation Service, including 
reviews of their reorganization efforts and the development of 
new ``ecoregion'' management plans.
    USDA agricultural research programs and projects, including 
a thorough review of research priorities, new research needs, 
and allocation of USDA research resources and funding.

Administrative and regulatory issues

    USDA reorganization of farm-related agencies, including 
field office closures, new county office structures and 
staffing, as well as review of authorities enacted in 1994 to 
reorganize all aspects of the Department of Agriculture. The 
Committee is especially interested in reviewing plans for 
reorganizing the USDA Forest Service.
    USDA Consolidated Farm Service Agency. In addition to the 
broader restructuring reviews, concerns have been raised 
regarding administration of funds to cover salaries and 
expenses beyond the levels appropriated.
    USDA Food and Nutrition Service. In addition to food stamp 
issues, strong oversight is needed on related programs, 
including The Emergency Food Assistance Program, school lunch, 
WIC, and the policies governing those programs, as well as 
human nutrition policies in general.
    The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA).
    Aquaculture and related production issues/concerns.
    Animal welfare and related statutes and issues.
    The Packers and Stockyards Act (PSA), the Packers and 
Stockyard Administration and related activities.
    The Agricultural Marketing Service, and related programs 
and activities.
    The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and 
related programs and activities.

Farm credit, rural development, and rural economy

    The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the statutes 
governing the FCA as regulator of the Farm Credit System (FSA), 
and reviews of both the FCA's and FCS' efforts to ensure System 
soundness relative to its use of risk management tools.
    USDA Farmers Home Administration (FmHA). Following last 
year's reorganization of the Department, FmHA programs and 
authorities were split between farm and rural programs. 
Oversight is needed to ensure that unnecessary duplication is 
avoided relative to administration of these programs, as well 
as reviews of the programs relative to need and function.
    The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FarmerMac). 
A component of the 1987 farm credit reform package, FarmerMac 
was intended to provide a competitive secondary mortgage market 
for agriculture credit. Oversight is needed to determine if it 
is meeting its mission.
    The Rural Utilities Service, Rural Business and Cooperative 
Development Service, Rural Housing and Community Development 
Service. These services are charged with key rural development/
maintenance authorities. Oversight is needed to ensure these 
authorities are being administered as intended.
    In addition, the Committee reserves the right to review and 
investigate general legislative, administrative, and regulatory 
issues affecting the jurisdiction of the Committee.
    (Note.--For a full description of the Committee's 
compliance with the oversight plan, see ``II. Committee 
Activities During the 104th Congress''.)

           II. Committee Activities During the 104th Congress

                     A. MAIN LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES

1. General

    The Committee on Agriculture reported or otherwise 
considered a variety of bills in the 104th Congress covering 
many of the diverse areas within its jurisdictional interest. 
Its principal efforts in the first session of the 104th 
Congress were devoted to developing the ``Freedom to Farm Act'' 
(H.R. 2195), commonly referred to as the ``1996 Farm Bill''. 
After extensive hearings in Washington, D.C. and around the 
country, ``Freedom to Farm'' became title I of the ``Seven-Year 
Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995'' (H.R. 2491) as 
part of an Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H.R. 2491 
adopted by the House of Representatives. That bill (H.R. 2491) 
was vetoed by the President which resulted in the incorporation 
of the ``Freedom to Farm'' provisions into an enactment in the 
second session of the 104th Congress that is known today as the 
``Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996'' 
(P.L. 104-127).
    The Committee spent a considerable amount of time during 
the first and second sessions of the 104th Congress reforming 
the food stamp program. The first such bill (H.R. 1135) 
reported by the Committee in the first session became title 
subtitle J of title XII of the revised short title, the 
``Seven-Year Balanced Budget Act of 1995'' (H.R. 2491). As 
previously noted, the President vetoed the ``Seven-Year 
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.''
    The food stamp provisions of H.R. 2491 were then 
incorporated into the ``Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Act of 1995'' (H.R. 4). The President also vetoed 
H.R. 4. The food stamp reform provisions were acted on by the 
Committee again in the 104th Congress in H.R. 3507, which was 
incorporated into H.R. 3734, the ``Personal Responsibility and 
Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996''. H.R. 3734 was 
subsequently enacted into law in the second session of Congress 
as P.L. 104-193.
    The Committee also met its budget responsibilities through 
the enactment of the ``Federal Agriculture Improvement and 
Reform Act of 1996'' (P.L. 104-127). This Act saves $10 billion 
over the next 7 years from the 1995 February Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO) baseline. Admittedly, reducing Federal 
spending by that amount will impact farmers. However, some 
economists predict that a balanced budget will also lead to a 
1.5 percent reduction in interest rates. The agriculture sector 
as a major user of credit has over $140 billion borrowed in 
terms of long term and short debt and would therefore benefit 
from such a result. If interest rates decline by 1.5 percent, a 
balanced budget by the year 2002 could lead to an interest rate 
savings for U.S. agricultural producers exceeding $15 billion 
over the next 7 years. More importantly the bill puts the $44 
billion projected to be spent on farm programs to use as a 
positive force for agricultural policy change and a period of 
transition to a more flexible program for farmers and 
producers.
    Enactment of the ``Personal Responsibility and Work 
Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996'' (Public Law 104-193) 
will reduce projected growth on the food stamps program by 
$23.3 billion over six years relative to preamendment law.

2. Major activities of the committee considered during the 104th 
        Congress

            1996 Farm bill
    The Committee saw title I of the ``Federal Agriculture and 
Improvement Reform Act'' (P.L. 104-127) enacted into law, which 
is known as the ``Agricultural Market Transition Act''. Title I 
of P.L. 104-127 replaces the traditional farm programs with a 
program that is commonly referred to as ``Freedom to Farm''. 
Public Law 104-127 replaces current federal programs for major 
crops with a new system of fixed annual cash payments to 
farmers that will decline for each of the next seven years 
(1996-2002) and will not be tied to land set-asides, lack of 
crop flexibility in planting, and so-called ``target prices'' 
for producer income support. Under this new program, farmers 
have broad flexibility in choosing which crops to plant (with 
certain exceptions), and are no longer required to idle land as 
part of a Federal supply management policy or program. This Act 
also phases out the Federal price support program for milk by 
December 31, 1999; requires USDA to consolidate the milk 
marketing orders system into not less than 10 nor more than 14 
orders and make other changes to the pricing system for milk by 
April 4, 1999; mandates USDA to engage in the maximum amount of 
Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) activity permitted by the 
Uruguay Round of the GATT and authorizes USDA to consent for 
three years to an interstate dairy compact among six New 
England states. Public Law 104-127 also extends the current 
sugar and peanut programs, while making several changes in the 
programs to reduce their costs; reauthorizes the Food Stamp 
Program for two years; provides $300 million for a new rural 
development fund; and suspends several provisions of the 
permanent 1938 and 1949 farm laws until 2002.
    Public Law 104-127 also reauthorizes various USDA 
conservation, export, research, credit and promotion programs.
            Food stamps and commodity distribution
    The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
Reconciliation Act (also referred to as Welfare Reform) 
includes extensive reforms of the Food Stamp Program. This Act 
greatly expands States' role in the programs by broadening 
States' authority to harmonize the Food Stamp Program with 
other welfare programs, adds to and strengthens work and other 
nonfinancial eligibility requirements, controls future spending 
increases, expands penalties for rules violations and controls 
over food stamp trafficking, and encourages the electronic 
delivery of benefits. The Act authorizes food stamp 
appropriations through fiscal year 2002, without specific 
dollar limits on appropriations or spending. The Act also 
combines the Emergency Food Assistance Program with other 
commodity distribution programs for soup kitchens and food 
banks. The Act requires that $100 million a year, from Food 
Stamp Program appropriations, be used to purchase commodities 
for this food distribution program.
            Program reforms leading to budget savings
    The Food Stamp Program and Commodity Distribution reforms 
included in The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
Act of 1996 resulted in budget savings of $23.3 billion over 
six years. Reforms included the retention of the Food Stamp 
Program as a ``safety net'' at the federal level; harmonization 
of AFDC and Food Stamp program; transition of the Food Stamp 
Program off ``automatic pilot'' except for annual increases in 
benefits based on increases in the cost of food; requirement 
that able-bodied individuals without dependents work; promotion 
of real jobs with new incentives; curbing of trafficking and 
fraud with increased penalties; and consolidation of food 
distribution programs.
    Reforms to mandatory farm programs lead to budget savings 
of $10.099 billion. Savings were achieved by providing market 
transition payments to farm producers in lieu of deficiency 
payments; reducing the payment limitation from $50,000 to 
$40,000; Capping crop price-support loan rates; allowing forage 
planting and harvesting; ending cotton 8-month loan extension; 
instituting changes to the dairy subtitle; reforming the peanut 
program; reforming the sugar program through increased 
assessments; restricting the CCC automated data processing 
funding; increasing the CCC commodity loan interest rate; 
ending the honey program; ending emergency feed assistance 
programs; ending Farmer-Owned Reserve; ending mandatory crop 
insurance catastrophic coverage; reducing Market Access 
Promotion spending; capping the Export Enhancement Program; 
extending and changing the payment system of the WRP; changing 
CRP enrollment authority; and expediting the sale of FmHA 
inventory properties.
            Food safety
    The Committee after nearly a decade, saw enacted into law 
in the 104th Congress, the ``Food Quality Protection Act of 
1996'' (Public Law 104-170), which makes significant changes to 
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 
(FIFRA), which governs U.S. sale and use of pesticide products, 
and to provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(FFDCA), which regulates pesticide residues in food. Public Law 
104-170 will also improve registration and reregistration of 
minor uses and antimicrobial pesticides, and reauthorize 
collection of maintenance fees to support pesticide 
reregistration. Public Law 104-170 reforms provisions of the 
``Delaney Clause'' which imposed a zero-cancer risk standard 
for pesticide residues on processed food, and establishes a new 
uniform health-based standard for chemical residues on raw 
agricultural products and processed foods. The new standard of 
``reasonable certainty of no harm'' includes requirements on 
EPA to assess special risk factors for infants and children 
when setting pesticide tolerance levels; permits EPA in certain 
instances to balance competing health risks when setting 
standards; and requires EPA to prepare and distribute 
information pamphlets that inform consumers about pesticides.
            Agricultural credit
    In 1996, the Committee culminated nearly a year of work 
that began in the first session of the 104th Congress by 
enacting H.R. 2029 (P.L. 104-105), the ``Farm Credit System 
Reform Act of 1996''. This legislation also contained 
provisions that were included in the ``Farmer Mac Reform Act of 
1995'' (H.R. 2130), that the Committee ordered reported on 
December 13, 1995 and that was also referred to the House 
Committee on Banking and Financial Services. Farmer Mac 
provisions were later adopted in the House after first being 
approved in the other body as part of H.R. 2029.
    This legislation provided regulatory relief to institutions 
of the Farm Credit System, cooperative lenders to the Nation's 
farmers and ranchers, as well as providing relief in the 
statutory capital requirements and operational standards of the 
Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC), Farmer Mac.
    Significant amendments to the ``Consolidated Farm and Rural 
Development Act'' (ConAct) also were enacted as part of the 
``Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996''. 
Congressmen Allard and Roberts introduced H.R. 2590, the ``Farm 
Credit and Rural Development Reform Act of 1995'' on November 
7, 1995 after hearings had been held on USDA's farm credit and 
rural development programs. A conference committee agreed to 
include several amendments to the ConAct that had been proposed 
in H.R. 2590 and legislation adopted in the other body.
            Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act
    The Committee reported and Congress enacted P.L. 104-48, 
legislation to reform the ``Perishable Agricultural Commodities 
Act, 1930'', (PACA) to modernize, streamline, and strengthen 
the operation of that Act. The main provisions included a 
three-year phase-out of retailers and grocery wholesalers from 
the provisions of the PACA program, inclusion of a paperless 
system to administer the PACA Trust, additional investigative 
authority provided to USDA, clarification with respect to 
collateral fees, and an update in program penalties.
            Futures trading
    The Committee saw enacted into law P.L. 104-9, the 
reauthorization of appropriations for the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (CFTC) through the year 2000 without making 
other changes to the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC is an 
independent agency created by Congress in 1974, that regulates 
commodity futures and options markets in the United States and 
that is charged with ensuring the economic utility of futures 
markets by encouraging their competitiveness and protecting 
market participants against manipulation, abusive trade 
practices and fraud.

 C. DIGEST OF BILLS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMITTEE ON WHICH 
                     SOME ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Note.--Similar or identical bills, and bills having reference 
to each other, are indicated by the number in parenthesis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Bills Enacted Into Law

            Public Law 104-9 (S. 178) (H.R. 618)
    Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to extend the 
authorization for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
through fiscal 2000 (approved April 21, 1995).
            Public Law 104-48 (H.R 1103)
    To amend the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930, 
to modernize, streamline, and strengthen the operation of the 
Act (approved November 15, 1995).
    The Act adds retailers and grocery wholesalers, who will be 
phased-out of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act 
(PACA), to the definition section of the current statute. Each 
of these entities operate as a dealer within the program and 
are therefore defined as a person that is a dealer engaged in 
their respective operations.
    Eliminates annual licenses for retailers and grocery 
wholesalers over a period of three years. The phase-out begins 
on the first renewal date upon enactment. In one year, 100% of 
the license fee will be paid; in year two, 75% of the license 
fee will be paid; in year three, 50% of the license fee will be 
paid; and in the fourth year, no license fee is required.
    Although retailers and grocery wholesalers will not be 
required to pay a license fee after three years, they are still 
required to obtain a PACA license and will remain subject to 
provisions of the PACA program.
    Requires new retailers and grocery wholesalers entering the 
program within the three-years of enactment of the legislation, 
to pay the license fee established under the applicable phase-
out year. After the third year, new retailers and grocery 
wholesalers will be required to pay a one-time administrative 
fee of $100.
    Addresses how license fees will be handled for other 
entities remaining under the PACA program. Strikes the current 
license fee cap of $400 and increases fees to $550. Gives the 
Secretary authority, after three years, to adjust license fee 
caps pursuant to rulemaking authority only when the PACA 
operating reserve reaches 25 percent or less. Under current 
law, the license fee cap can only be changed through 
legislation. It also repeals the current 25 percent cap on the 
operating reserve.
    Increases penalties for operating without a license, 
inadvertent operation without a license, and for late renewals.
    Implements the paperless trust provisions of the PACA 
agreement. Currently, those who wish to protect their benefits 
must notify USDA within 30 days after final payment. This Act 
removes the filing requirement with USDA. Instead, transaction 
terms set forth in sufficient detail must be submitted by the 
unpaid supplier, seller and agent to the commission merchant, 
dealer or broker. The Act also establishes that a licensee may 
also preserve trust benefits through the use of ordinary and 
usual billing or invoice practices as long as a statement 
indicating that the commodities listed on the invoice are 
subject to trust claims.
    Outlines new requirements for USDA when pursuing a PACA 
investigation. USDA must have a written complaint in hand 
before pursuing and/or expanding a PACA investigation. The 
Secretary of Agriculture may expand an investigation if 
additional violations are discovered while investigating a 
complaint based on reasonable grounds. The identity of any 
person filing written notification is considered confidential. 
USDA is also required to inform the subject of an investigation 
about the status of USDA's actions thereon no later than 180 
days after initial notification. Also, the Act increases the 
damage threshold required to receive an expedited review 
(shortened procedure) of the complaints from $15,000 to 
$30,000.
    The Act extends current provisions adopted earlier that 
establish filing fees for informal and formal reparation 
complaints. The $60 fee for an informal reparation complaint 
and the $300 fee for a formal reparation complaint are retained 
and become subject to rulemaking authority if the Secretary 
wishes to adjust the level in the future.
    The Act establishes clarification of the status of 
collateral fees and expenses. Collateral fees are commonly 
referred to as slotting fees, which establish product space in 
the store, and/or rebates, fees used for promotion activities. 
They are fees considered separate from invoice fees.
    In the cases of misbranding, when produce grade, quality, 
quantity, weight or origin is misrepresented, persons other 
than the first licensee handling the misbranded commodities are 
not held liable for the violation by reason of the conduct of 
another if the person did not have knowledge of the violation 
or lacked the ability to correct the violation.
    Authorizes USDA to assess civil monetary penalties not to 
exceed $2000 for violation in lieu of license suspension or 
revocation for each violation or each day it continues. 
Currently, if an entity operating within PACA fraudulently 
obtains a PACA license or is involved in unfair conduct the 
only recourse available to USDA is to initiate a revocation 
hearing on the entity's license. This new provision allows USDA 
to take a less stringent step by assessing a civil penalty on 
the entity in lieu of license revocation. However, USDA is 
required to give consideration to the business size, number of 
employees, seriousness of the violation, and nature and amount 
of the violation when assessing the amount of the violation.
    Amends the current definition of who is a violator to 
permit individuals, who are responsibly connected to a company 
in violation of PACA, the opportunity to demonstrate that they 
were not responsible for the specific violation.
    Under current law, an individual found to be responsibly 
connected to a company in violation of PACA can be banned from 
working (employment sanction) within the industry for a year. 
However, under current law if such individual is found to be 
working in the industry while under an employment sanction, 
USDA can bring enforcement action only against the company 
employing but permit USDA to extend the employment sanction to 
such individual for an additional year under such 
circumstances.
            Public Law 104-55 (H.R. 436)
    Requires the head of any Federal agency to differentiate 
between fats, oils, and greases of animal, marine, or vegetable 
origin, and other oils and greases in issuing certain 
regulations under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (approved 
November 20, 1995).
    Defines the term ``animal fat'' to mean each type of animal 
fat, oil, or grease, including fat, oil or grease from fish or 
marine mammal. Additionally, the term ``animal fat'' includes 
any fat, oil, or grease referred to in section 61(a)(2) of 
title 13, United States Code.
    Defines the term ``vegetable oil'' to include any vegetable 
oil referred to in section 61(a)(1) of title 13, United States 
Code.
    Requires a Federal agency in issuing or enforcing a 
regulation, an interpretation or a guideline relating to a fat, 
oil, or grease under a Federal law, to differentiate between 
and establish separate categories for animal fats and vegetable 
oils and other oils.
    Provides that in differentiating between classes of animal 
fats and vegetable oils and other oils, the Federal agency 
shall consider differences in physical, chemical, biological, 
and other properties, and in the effects on human health and 
the environment of the classes.
    Provides that under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the 
liability for a tank vessel carrying animal fat or vegetable 
oil is limited to the greater of $600 per gross ton of the tank 
vessel or $500,000. The liability of the responsible party is 
limited to the same amount as the tank vessel and such 
responsible party must establish and maintain, in accordance 
with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of 
Transportation, evidence of financial responsibility sufficient 
to meet the removal costs and damages incident to an oil 
discharge.
            Public Law 104-105 (H.R. 2029)
    Amends the Farm Credit Act of 1971 to provide regulatory 
relief, and for other purposes (approved February 20, 1996).
    The legislation removes several unnecessary and costly 
regulatory requirements of current law without jeopardizing the 
safety and soundness of system institutions by--
    (1) extending the period between mandated examinations from 
one year to 18 months, except that the Farm Credit 
Administration retains authority to examine institutions more 
frequently if necessary;
    (2) allows for the reduction of insurance premiums to Farm 
Credit institutions as the Farm Credit Insurance Fund reaches 
sufficient levels, and provide a method for refunding excess 
amounts as the fund earns interest;
    (3) reduces administrative costs by allowing Farm Credit 
associations to form administrative service entities without 
changing current lending authorities;
    (4) reduces the cost of Farm Credit participation in 
secondary markets by removing the borrower stock and borrower 
rights requirements from loans to be sold into the secondary 
market;
    (5) relieves Farm Credit banks and Farm Credit borrowers 
from antiquated and costly paperwork requirements; and
    (6) provides relief in the statutory capital requirements 
and operational standards of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage 
Corporation (FAMC), Farmer Mac.
            Public Law 104-127 (H.R. 2854) (S. 1541)
    To modify the operation of certain agricultural programs 
(approved April 4, 1996). Major provisions of the ``Federal 
Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996'' (FAIR) 
include:
    Production flexibility contracts--Eligible producers (those 
who had participated or had certified acreage in the wheat, 
feed grains, cotton and rice programs in any one of the past 
five years) can enter into seven-year market transition 
contracts. Sign-up for the new program was to begin 
approximately 45 days after enactment and extend through August 
1, 1996. A 50 percent advance payment was to be available to 
producers within 30 days of signup with the remainder of the 
1996 payment due by September 30, 1996. Payments in subsequent 
years were to be made on September 30, with producers having 
the option of receiving half of their annual payment in advance 
either on December 15 or January 15.
    Planting flexibility--Any commodity may be grown on 
contract acreage except fruits and vegetables. Restrictions on 
haying and grazing of contract acreage were dropped so that 
alfalfa and other forage crops may be grown on contract acreage 
without loss of payments.
    Nonrecourse marketing assistance loans--Establishes maximum 
loan rates at the following levels: Rice: $6.50/cwt, Upland 
Cotton: $0.5192/lb, Wheat: $2.58/bu, Corn: $1.89/bu, Soybeans: 
$5.26/bu, ELS Cotton: $0.7965/lb. The Secretary would retain 
authority to make downward adjustments to wheat, feed grains 
and oilseeds loan rates based on specified stocks-to-use 
criteria. The legislation establishes a minimum loan rate for 
rice at $6.50/cwt, cotton at $0.50/lb and soybeans at $4.92/bu. 
and eliminates the 8-month upland cotton loan extension.
    Peanuts--The FAIR Act saves $412 million from the federal 
peanut program, making it a no-cost program. The quota support 
rate is lowered from $678/ton to $610/ton through 2002. The 
price support escalator is eliminated. The legislation 
eliminates the national poundage quota floor (currently 
1,350,000 tons) and undermarketing provisions of current law. 
The bill also allows limited sale, lease and transfer of quota 
across county lines.
    Sugar--In order to make the program more market-oriented, a 
recourse loan system is implemented until imports reach 1.5 
million short tons for FY 1997-2002. The legislation terminates 
marketing allotments and implements a one cent penalty on 
forfeited sugar. Provisions of current law that require the 
Sugar Program to operate at no-net cost are retained in this 
bill. It also retains the loan rate for raw cane sugar and 
refined beet sugar at the 1995 levels, 18 cents and 22.9 cents 
respectively, and retains a nine-month loan. The legislation 
would raise the assessment on sugar processors to achieve $52 
million in budget savings over seven years to be used toward 
deficit reduction.
    Milk Price Support and Marketing Order Programs--Eliminates 
the currently imposed budget assessment on dairy producers 
immediately and phases down the support price on butter, powder 
and cheese over four years from $10.35/cwt in 1996 to $9.90/cwt 
in 1999. At the end of 1999, price support authority is 
eliminated and a recourse loan program is implemented at the 
1999 support level (9.90/cwt). The Secretary of Agriculture is 
instructed to consolidate milk marketing orders from 33 to no 
more than 14 and no less than 10 in three years and to complete 
other reforms in the pricing system for milk by April 4, 1999.
    Federal Dairy Export programs--Directs the Secretary of 
Agriculture to use the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) at 
the maximum volume and funding levels permitted under GATT. The 
Secretary is authorized to assist the United States dairy 
industry in establishing and maintaining an export trading 
company to facilitate the international market development for, 
and exportation of, U.S. dairy products. In the event the U.S. 
dairy industry does not establish an export trading company, 
the Secretary is directed to indicate which entity autonomous 
of the U.S. government is best suited to facilitate the 
international market development for and exportation of U.S. 
dairy products. The Secretary is also directed to perform a 
study of the potential impact of new access cheese imports 
under the Uruguay Round on U.S. milk prices, dairy producer 
income, and the cost of Federal dairy programs.
    Northeast Dairy Compact--The Secretary of Agriculture may, 
upon the finding of a compelling public interest in the area, 
consent to the establishment of the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
The Compact would terminate with the completion of price and 
order reform authorized in the Act (i.e. not later than April 
4, 1999).
    Payment limitations--Reduces the current payment limitation 
by 20 percent, from $50,000 to $40,000 and extends provisions 
of current law that limit marketing loan gains and loan 
deficiency payments to $75,000 per person per year.
    Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) reforms--The FAIR Act 
saves $396 million by reforming the manner in which CCC 
purchases computers. In addition, rates on CCC agricultural 
commodity loans are increased by 100 basis points for a savings 
of $260 million over seven years.
    Crop insurance--Eliminates the mandatory nature of 
catastrophic crop insurance, but requires producers to waive 
all federal disaster assistance if they opt not to purchase 
catastrophic insurance. Dual delivery of crop insurance to 
producers is eliminated in those states that have adequate 
private crop insurance delivery. The Act also corrects a 
provision of current law by amending the noninsured crop 
assistance program to include seed crops. Eligibility to 
purchase crop insurance is no longer linked to conservation and 
swampbuster compliance for producers who choose not to 
participate in farm programs.
    Office of risk management--Establishes within USDA the 
Office of Risk Management to oversee and supervise the Federal 
Crop Insurance Corporation. The Act directs the Secretary to 
establish a business interruption insurance program that allows 
producers of program crops to obtain revenue insurance 
coverage, and the current Options Pilot Program is also 
extended through 2002. The Office of Risk Management is charged 
with oversight of these pilot programs.
    Commission on 21st century production agriculture--An 
eleven member commission is established to monitor the 
agricultural economy during the transition contemplated in the 
FAIR Act. An initial report to Congress due by June 1, 1998, 
will evaluate the success of market transition contracts in 
supporting economic viability in farming, an assessment of 
nation's food security, changes in land values and farm income, 
and an assessment of the progress on regulatory and tax relief 
for agricultural producers. By January 1, 2001, the commission 
will make recommendations to Congress about the appropriate 
role of the Federal government in production agriculture.
    Permanent agricultural law--The FAIR Act suspends certain 
provisions of the Agriculture Act of 1949 and the Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938 for crop years 1996 through 2002 
together with certain other technical amendments.
    P.L. 480 and related programs--Reauthorizes Food for Peace 
and allows private sector participation for the first time. The 
Food Security Wheat Reserve is renamed the Food Security 
Commodity Reserve to reflect that corn, rice and sorghum are 
added as eligible commodities. A four million metric ton cap is 
placed on the reserve and access to reserve commodities is made 
easier.
    Agricultural trade--Reauthorizes several agricultural trade 
and export programs with added emphasis on high value and 
value-added products. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed 
to monitor compliance with the agriculture provisions of the 
Uruguay Round Agreement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and report violations to the U.S. Trade 
Representative. Agricultural producers are given additional 
protection against the economic effects of agricultural 
embargoes. In addition, several unnecessary and outdated 
provisions of Federal agricultural trade law are repealed.
    Market Access Program--The Market Promotion Program (MPP) 
is renamed the Market Access Program to more accurately reflect 
program goals. Expenditures are capped at $90 million per year 
and reforms are implemented to restrict participation to small 
businesses, farmer-owned cooperatives and agricultural groups.
    Export Enhancement Program (EEP)--EEP expenditures are 
capped at $350 million in 1996; $250 million in 1997; $500 
million in 1998; $550 million in 1999; $579 million in 2000 and 
$478 million for 2001 and 2002. For the years 2000-2002, 
funding levels for EEP represent the maximum allowable 
expenditures under GATT. In addition, the Secretary of 
Agriculture is given authority to subsidize the export of 
intermediate value-added products.
    Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)--Gives the Secretary of 
Agriculture authority to enter into new contracts and extend 
expiring CRP contracts. The authorized maximum acreage in the 
CRP is maintained at 36.4 million acres. It also allows 
participants to terminate CRP contracts except on those lands 
that are deemed to be of high environmental value. Funds saved 
due to termination of contracts may be used by the Secretary to 
enroll new lands in the program.
    Wetlands Reserve Program--The Wetland Reserve Program (WRP) 
is retained with modifications to encourage the use of 
temporary easements and cost-share restorations.
    Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP)--This 
program targets approximately $1.2 billion over seven years to 
assist crop and livestock producers deal with environmental and 
conservation improvements on the farm. Assistance can be used 
for animal waste management facilities, terraces, waterways, 
filterstrips or other structural and management practices to 
protect water, soil and related resources. Assistance to 
individual operations is capped at $10,000 per year for a 
maximum of five years. Large operators, as defined by the 
Secretary, will be ineligible for assistance.
    Everglades agricultural area--Provides $200 million for 
land acquisition in the Florida Everglades for the purpose of 
environmental restoration. An additional $100 million in 
federal support will be financed through the sale or swap of 
other federally held land in Florida.
    Other new conservation programs--Farms for the Future 
Program provides $35 million to preserve farmland from 
commercial development. A new Conservation Farm Option offers 
producers an additional alternative in meeting conservation 
goals. A Flood Risk Reduction Program is also included to 
provide farmers incentives to take out of production frequently 
flooded lands.
    Conservation compliance reform--Producers are given 
enhanced flexibility to modify conservation practices if they 
can demonstrate that the new practices achieve equal or greater 
erosion control. Variances from conservation compliance can now 
be granted on account of adverse weather or disease, and 
program payment penalties can be adjusted to be commensurate 
with the violation.
    Swampbuster reforms--The Natural Resources Conservation 
Service (NRCS) is designated the lead federal agency in 
wetlands delineation and regulation on grazing lands. The 
legislation stipulates that current wetlands delineations 
remain valid until a producer requests a review. Penalties can 
now be adjusted to fit the wetlands violation, exemptions can 
be granted for good faith and wetlands mitigation options are 
expanded.
    Federal Food Stamp Program--Reauthorized the Food Stamp 
Program for two years while Congress continued to work on 
comprehensive welfare reform legislation.
    Generic Commodity Promotion Program--Directs the Secretary 
of Agriculture to establish a generic commodity promotion 
program. Under the program, interested industries could 
petition USDA for the establishment of a commodity promotion 
program. Currently, each commodity must receive specific 
authorization from Congress to create a promotion program. 
Recognizing that the generic promotion program will not be 
operational for some time, the legislation authorizes new 
promotion programs for popcorn, canola and kiwifruit.
    USDA Farm Lending Program Reforms--Redirects farm lending 
programs to their original intent. Authority to make loans for 
a variety of non-agricultural purposes, such as recreation 
facilities and small business enterprises is repealed. The 
Secretary of Agriculture is given authority to use collection 
agencies to recover delinquent loans. The legislation prohibits 
additional loans to delinquent borrowers and streamlines 
procedures for disposal of inventory property. A portion of 
loan funding is reserved for new and beginning farmers.
    Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP)--Amendments to 
the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (Subtitle E) 
authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide grants, 
direct and guaranteed loans and other assistance to meet rural 
development needs across the country. Funding under RCAP will 
be allocated to three areas: 1) Rural Community Facilities 2) 
Rural Utilities and 3) Rural Business and Cooperative 
Development. The new program provides greater flexibility, 
state and local decision-making and a simplified, uniform 
application process.
    Water and waste water systems--The funding authorization 
for these water and waste water system purposes is increased 
from $500 million to $590 million.
    Telemedicine and distance learning programs--Reauthorizes 
and streamlines these programs. Under these programs, the 
Secretary of Agriculture may make grants and loans to assist 
rural communities with construction of facilities and services 
to provide distance learning and telemedicine services. Funding 
is authorized at $100 million annually.
    Fund for Rural America--The fund is provided with $300 
million in 1997-1999. The Secretary of Agriculture is required 
to spend at least one-third of the amount on research and one-
third of the amount on rural development. The other one-third 
of the money can be allocated to either purpose at the 
discretion of the Secretary. All the funding must be spent 
through existing research and rural development programs.
    Agricultural research--Reauthorizes federal agricultural 
research, extension and education programs for two years. This 
reauthorization extension will allow Congress to continue 
ongoing review of these programs to determine how best to use 
the $1.8 billion in annual agricultural research, extension and 
education spending leading into the XXI century. Additional 
research dollars are made available under this bill through the 
Fund for Rural America.
    Agriculture quarantine and inspection--Amends the Food, 
Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 to allow the 
Secretary of Agriculture to collect and spend fees collected 
over $100 million to cover the cost of providing quarantine and 
inspection services for imports. In fiscal year 2003 the 
Committee has provided the funding necessary to convert the AQI 
user fee account to a non-appropriated account under the 
discretion of the Secretary. Beyond fiscal year 2003 it is 
expected that all funds collected for the purpose of 
agriculture quarantine inspection will be dedicated for that 
purpose. It is also expected that oversight on this account 
will continue to be assumed by the Agriculture Sub-Committee on 
Agriculture Appropriations and the Agriculture authorizing 
Committee.
    Humane horse transportation--Authorizes the Secretary of 
Agriculture, because of the unique and special needs of equine 
being transported to slaughter and subject to the availability 
of appropriations, to issue guidelines for the regulation of 
persons regularly engaged in the commercial transportation of 
equine for slaughter within the U.S.
    The object of any prospective regulation on this matter 
will be the individual or company which regularly engages in 
commercial transport of equine to slaughter, and will not 
extend to individuals or others who periodically transport 
equine for slaughter outside of their regular activities.
    The Secretary was instructed to employ performance based 
standards as opposed to engineering based standards when 
establishing guidelines for the regulation of commercial 
transportation of equine species to slaughter.
    No authorization of authority under this section was to be 
construed to give the Secretary authority to regulate routine 
or regular transport of non-slaughter equine. Further, no 
authorization of authority under this section was to be 
construed to give the Secretary authority to regulate the 
routine or regular transportation of any other livestock, 
including poultry, to a slaughter facility or any other 
destination or by any conveyance.
    Safe Meat and Poultry Inspection Panel--Creates a panel of 
scientists, within the Food Safety and Inspection Service, 
charged with the responsibility of reviewing all inspection 
policies from a scientific perspective. The panel's report and 
the Secretary of Agriculture's responses, must be published in 
the Federal Register.
    State inspected meat--Within 90 days of enactment, the 
Secretary shall report and recommend to Congress the steps 
necessary to achieve interstate shipment of state-inspected 
meat products.
            Public Law 104-165 (H.R. 701)
    To authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to convey lands 
to the city of Rolla, Missouri (approved July 24, 1996).
    Public Law 104-165 authorizes the Secretary to convey land 
within the Mark Twain National Forest to the City of Rolla, 
Missouri. The transfer will be based upon the City of Rolla 
paying the Secretary consideration equal to the fair market 
value of such conveyance as determined by an appraisal 
acceptable to the Secretary. Payment may be made in full within 
6 months of the conveyance or in twenty equal installments made 
annually until paid in full.
    The legislation further provides that the Secretary, in 
consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office, 
ensure that the historic resources on the property are 
conserved by requiring the City to convey an historic 
preservation easement to the State assuring the right of the 
State to enter the property for historic preservation purposes. 
The protection of historic resources is the responsibility of 
the City and the State.
    It is the intention of the City that the historic resources 
in question, a former district ranger office, be used as a 
regional tourist center for the Mark Twain National Forest.
            Public Law 104-170 (H.R. 1627)
    To amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic (FFDC) Act, and for other purposes (approved August 3, 
1996).
    The Food Quality Protection Act (P.L. 104-170) focuses on 
children's health by implementing recommendations of the 
National Research Council's report on ``Pesticides in the Diets 
of Infants and Children.'' The Act requires the Federal 
government to fully consider any special risks to infants and 
children in its regulatory actions.
    Promotes safer crop protection products by expediting 
registration of reduced-risk pesticides so that safer products 
may reach the market sooner and replace older products.
    Provides regulatory relief for minor use and public health 
pesticides by streamlining regulatory procedures for pesticides 
used in the production of smaller-acreage or so-called ``minor 
use'' crops. This category includes many fruits and vegetables, 
which are a key component of a healthy diet. This special 
regulatory treatment would also be extended to pesticides used 
by government officials to control pests and diseases injurious 
to public health.
    Provides industry funded reregistration by extending the 
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) authority to collect 
$76 million in reregistration fees from the chemical industry 
through the year 2001. Reregistration is required by law to 
assure that older chemicals meet today's tougher standards.
    Reinforces EPA's authority to require information on 
whether a pesticide chemical may mimic estrogen in humans or 
induce endocrine effects.
    Coordination of regulations implementing FIFRA and the FFDC 
Act will by required by establishing a single standard of 
safety for pesticide residue on raw and processed foods by 
providing information through large food retail stores to 
consumers about the health risks of pesticide residues and how 
to avoid them. Preemption of state and local food safety laws 
is allowed if they are based on concentrations of pesticides 
residues below recently established Federal residue limits 
called tolerances to be safe and ensure reasonable certainty of 
no harm.
            Public Law 104-193 (H.R. 3734)
    To provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 201(a)(1) 
of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1997 
(approved August 22, 1996).
    Title VIII and relevant provisions of title IX incorporated 
most of the provisions of title X, the Food Stamp Reform and 
Commodity Distribution Act of 1996, and relevant provisions of 
title XI of H.R. 3507. Title X of H.R. 3507 incorporated most 
of the provisions of the Conference Report to H.R. 4, which was 
vetoed by the President on January 9, 1996. (Note: For 
discussion of H.R. 4 see Part II, C. ``3. Vetoed Bills'' 
infra).
    Public Law 104-193 made extensive reforms to the food stamp 
program. Based on these reforms, projected growth in the food 
stamp program was reduced by $23.3 billion over six years 
relative to preamendment law:
    Appropriations for the food stamp program are authorized 
through fiscal year 2002, without specific dollar limits on 
appropriations or spending.
    States were provided authority to operate a simplified food 
stamp program under which they may determine food stamp 
benefits for households receiving food stamps and the program 
established by the state under the Temporary Assistance to 
Needy Families program.
    Monthly food stamp benefits will continue to be adjusted 
annually to reflect changes in the cost of food, except at 100 
percent of the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan instead of 103 
percent. Benefits may not drop below preamendment levels as a 
result of this change.
    The standard deduction and excess shelter expense deduction 
are maintained at preamendment levels. State and local energy 
assistance is counted as income. The vehicle asset allowance is 
increased to $4,650, but future indexation for inflation is 
eliminated.
    Persons under 21 who are parents or married and living with 
their own parent must apply for food stamps as part of their 
parents' household.
    Able-bodied individuals between the age of 18 and 50 who 
have no dependents must work at least half time (20 hours per 
week), or participate in a workfare or training program to be 
eligible for food stamps. Such persons may receive food stamps 
without working or participating in a workfare or training 
program for three months out of every three years. 
Additionally, a person who has exhausted the three-month period 
may receive food stamps for an additional three months if they 
are laid off from their job during the three-year period. A 
state may seek a waiver from this work requirement for an area 
of the state in which the unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent 
or there are insufficient jobs available.
    The penalties against retailers and recipients for 
trafficking and fraud are increased. The authority to impose 
criminal forfeiture against the property of those convicted of 
food stamp trafficking is established.
    States may operate work supplementation or support programs 
under which the value of public assistance benefits, including 
food stamps, are provided to employers who hire recipients and, 
in turn, use the benefits to supplement the wages paid to the 
recipient. A limited number of states may pay food stamp 
benefits in cash to recipients working for at least three 
months in an unsubsidized job earning $350 or more a month.
    States may impose the same penalties against food stamp 
recipients as imposed against the individual for failing to 
comply with state welfare program rules.
    States are encouraged to implement Electronic Benefit 
Transfer (EBT) systems. The Federal Reserve Board's 
``Regulation E'' (which provides certain protections for 
consumers using cards to electronically access their accounts) 
is not applied to any EBT system distributing means-tested 
benefits established or administered by state or local 
governments.
    A single emergency food distribution program is established 
by consolidating several existing commodity distribution 
programs. The Act provides that $100 million annually is 
authorized to be used from Food Stamp Program appropriations to 
purchase commodities for distribution under the new program.

Public Law 104-310 (H.R. 1874)

    To modify the boundaries of the Talladega National Forest, 
Alabama (approved October 19, 1996).
    Authorizes the Secretary of Interior to transfer from the 
Bureau of Land Management to the Talladega National Forest, 
399.40 acres, more or less, in Huntsville Meridian, Township 17 
South Range 8 East, Section 34 NE 1/4, SW 1/4, and S 1/2 NW 1/
4, Cleburne County. Also this legislation authorizes the 
transfer of 160.00 acres, more or less, in Huntsville Meridian, 
Township 13 South Range 9 East, Section 28m SE 1/4, Calhoun 
County.

        beginning January 1, 1997.
            Public Law 104-134, (H.R. 3019)
    Making appropriations for fiscal year 1996 to make a 
further downpayment toward a balanced budget, and for other 
purposes (approved April 25, 1996). Two provisions within this 
Committee's jurisdiction were included in the Public Law--
          (1) a provision that allowed USDA to process loan 
        applications of borrowers who had submitted a loan 
        application and were not 90 days delinquent on any 
        other USDA farmer program loans. At the time the 
        Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) was 
        enacted, the FAIR Act had restricted the eligibility 
        requirements of USDA's farm credit program to borrowers 
        who were not more than 90 days delinquent on loans and 
        who submitted an application for an additional loan on

        determined by the Secretary;
          Extended the availability of appropriated amounts for 
        loans and guaranteed loans to remain available until

        loan fund; Rural Telephone Bank; rural electrification 
        and telecommunications loans; and rural economic 
        development loans;
          Prohibited the Secretary of Agriculture from using

        Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 that provides assistance 
        to, the U.S. Mink Export Development Council or any 
        mink industry trade association;
          Substantially re-wrote the enrollment procedures for 
        the Wetlands Reserve Program--limited FY 1997 
        enrollment to 130,000 acres, provides that more than 
        130,000 acres may be enrolled in FY 1997 if non-federal 
        funds are available, allowed more permanent easements

        production flexibility contract when it is made known 
        to the Federal official having authority to obligate or 
        expend such funds that the land covered by the contract

        federal agency rule;
          Extended the authority to make multifamily rural 
        housing loans (including set-asides for nonprofit 
        entities and housing in underserved areas) by one year

   2. BILLS ACTED ON BY THE COMMITTEE INCLUDED IN OTHER LAWS ENACTED

H.R. 618 included in Public Law 104-9

    See the discussion under ``1. Bills enacted into Law. 
Public Law 104-9 (S. 178)''.

H.R. 714 included in Public Law 104-106 (S. 1124)

    Public Law 104-106, the ``National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1996'' (approved February 10, 1996).
    Section 2901 of this Act is cited as the ``Illinois Land 
Conservation Act of 1995''. This provision was reported, 
amended, by the Committee on Agriculture on July 28, 1995 (H. 
Rept. 104-191 (part II)) under H.R. 714 and passed by the House 
on July 31, 1995. For a description of this provision, see 
discussion under Part II, C, ``5. Bills acted on by the House 
but Not by the Senate'' and ``3. Bills Vetoed''.

H.R. 2130 included in Public Law 104-105 (H.R. 2029)

    See the discussion under ``1. Bills enacted into Law. 
Public Law 104-105 (H.R. 2029)'' and ``7. Bills Reported to the 
House But Not Considered''.

H.R. 3507 included in Public Law 104-193 (H.R. 3734)

    On June 11, 1996, the Committee met to consider title X and 
other related provisions of H.R. 3507 with respect to its 
Recommendations to the Budget Committee as provided in the 
Budget Resolution Instructions contained in H. Con. Res 178, 
the Reconciliation Bill for Fiscal Year 1997. The 
recommendations of the Committee on Agriculture to the Budget 
Committee were included in H.R. 3734.
    (Note: For a discussion of H.R. 3734, see description of 
P.L. 104-193 in Part II, C, ``1. Bills Enacted into Law'', 
supra.)
    While similar, H.R. 3507 differed from Public Law 104-193, 
inter alia, in the following ways:
          In addition to state or local energy assistance, 
        benefits paid under the Low-Income Home Energy 
        Assistance Programs was considered income;
          The threshold above which the value of a vehicle is 
        counted as an asset for determining eligibility was set 
        at $4,600;
          Able-bodied recipients between the ages of 18 and 50 
        who have no dependents would be ineligible if, during 
        the prior 12-month period, they received food stamps 
        for four months or more while not working at least half 
        time or participating in workfare or a training 
        program; and
          States that had implemented EBT on a statewide basis, 
        reduced rates of error to acceptable levels, or paid 
        that part of the food stamp error over acceptable 
        levels, could elect to operate the food stamp program 
        under a block grant.

                            3. VETOED BILLS

H.R. 4, The Personal Responsibility Act of 1995

    On March 7, 1995, the Committee considered and reported 
H.R. 1135, the Food Stamp Reform and Commodity Distribution 
Act, favorably to the House. The provisions of H.R. 1135 were 
incorporated into title V of H.R. 1214, the Personal 
Responsibility Act of 1995, by a rule under which it was 
considered on the House Floor. Later the provisions of title V 
of H.R. 1214 were substantially incorporated into title XI of 
H.R. 4, which passed the House on March 24, 1995. H.R. 4, the 
Personal Responsibility Act of 1995, was vetoed on January 9, 
1996.
    (Note.--Most of the provisions of the Conference Report to 
H.R. 4 were also incorporated into the H.R. 2491, the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1995, as subtitle J of title XII. H.R. 2491 was 
vetoed on December 6, 1995. For discussion of the provisions of 
subtitle J of title XII of H.R. 2491, see also ``3. Bills 
Vetoed''. For discussion of H.R. 1135, see also ``7. Bills 
Reported to the House But Not Considered''.)
    Title X and relevant provisions of title XI of the 
Conference Report to H.R. 4 made extensive reforms to the Food 
Stamp Program. Based on these reforms, projected growth in the 
food stamp program was reduced by $25.5 billion over seven 
years relative to preamendment existing law, and--
          The Food Stamp Program was reauthorized through 
        fiscal year 2002 with the authority to obligate funds 
        limited to specifically prescribed amounts for each 
        year, adjusted annually to reflect changes to the cost 
        of food in the Thrifty Food Plan and levels of 
        participation;
          Benefits paid as state or local energy assistance and 
        under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program 
        were to be considered income;
          States were provided the authority to operate a 
        simplified food stamp program under which they might 
        determine food stamp benefits for households receiving 
        food stamps and the program established by the state 
        under the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families 
        Program;
          Monthly food stamp benefits would continue to be 
        adjusted annually to reflect changes in the cost of 
        food, except at 100 percent of the cost of the Thrifty 
        Food Plan instead of 103 percent (benefits would not 
        drop below preamendment levels as a result of this 
        change);
          The standard deduction and excess shelter expense 
        deduction were maintained at preamendment levels;
          State and local energy assistance was counted as 
        income;
          The vehicle asset allowance was maintained at $4,600, 
        but future indexation for inflation was eliminated;
          Persons under 21 who are parents or married and 
        living with their own parent must apply for food stamps 
        as part of their parents' household;
          Able-bodied recipients between the ages of 18 and 50 
        who have no dependents would be ineligible if, during 
        the prior 12-month period, they received food stamps 
        for four months or more while not working at least half 
        time or participating in workfare or a training 
        program;
          The penalties against retailers and recipients for 
        trafficking and fraud were increased;
          The authority to impose criminal forfeiture against 
        the property of those convicted of food stamp 
        trafficking is established;
          States could operate work supplementation or support 
        programs under which the value of public assistance 
        benefits, including food stamps, were provided to 
        employers who hire recipients and, in turn, use the 
        benefits to supplement the wages paid to the recipient;
          A limited number of states could pay food stamp 
        benefits in cash to recipients working for at least 
        three months in an unsubsidized job earning $350 or 
        more a month;
          States could impose the same penalties against food 
        stamp recipients as imposed against the individual for 
        failing to comply with state welfare program rules;
          States were encouraged to implement Electronic 
        Benefit Transfer (EBT) systems;
          The Federal Reserve Board's ``Regulation E'' (which 
        provides certain protections for consumers using cards 
        to electronically access their accounts) was not 
        applied to any EBT system distributing means-tested 
        benefits established or administered by state or local 
        governments;
          States that had implemented EBT on a statewide basis, 
        reduced rates of error to acceptable levels, or paid 
        that part of the food stamp error over acceptable 
        levels could elect to operate the food stamp program 
        under a block grant; and
          Single emergency food distribution program was 
        established by consolidating several existing commodity 
        distribution programs. The Bill provided that $300 
        million annually could be used from food stamp program 
        appropriations to purchase commodities for distribution 
        under the new program.

H.R. 2491, The Seven Year Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act of 1995

    Title I of H.R 2491 as passed by the House of 
Representatives was cited as the ``Agricultural Reconciliation 
Act of 1995''. H.R. 2491 would have reduced projected 
agriculture spending for farm commodity programs by $13.4 
billion over the period 1996 through 2002.
    Title I of H.R. 2491 consisted of the final consideration 
by the Committee on Agriculture that was patterned in large 
part after H.R. 2195, the Freedom to Farm Act, which was 
designed to reform U.S. Agricultural policy to perhaps the 
greatest extent since the 1930's.
    The Committee on Agriculture was appointed as conferees to 
H.R. 2491 on October 30, 1995 with a conference report (H.Rept. 
104-350) filed in the House of Representatives on November 17, 
1995 and final passage on November 30, 1995 by a vote of 235 
yeas to 192 nays. However, the President vetoed the measure on 
December 6, 1995 with no further action taking place on H.R. 
2491.
    Major agriculture-related provisions of the conference 
agreement included:
            Production flexibility contracts
    Eligible producers (those who had participated in the 
wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice programs in any one of the 
past five years) could enter into seven-year ``production 
flexibility contracts'' between 1996 and 2002. The deadline for 
entering into the contract was to be April 15, 1996. Payments 
would be made on September 30 of each year beginning in 1996. 
Farmers would also have the option of receiving half of their 
annual payment by December 15 of the previous year (except in 
1996 when the advance payment would be due within 60 days of 
the signing of a contract).
    Payments would be made on 85 percent of a farm's contract 
acreage. On this acreage participants would be free to plant 
any program crop, oilseed, industrial or experimental crop, 
mung beans, lentils and dry peas. Planting of fruits and 
vegetables would be prohibited on payment acres as would haying 
and grazing during the five principal growing months. The 
remaining 15 percent of acreage would be free from any planting 
restrictions. These commodity program changes would result in 
$8.6 billion in budget savings over the next seven years.
            Peanuts
    The legislation saved $434 million from the federal peanut 
program, making it a no-cost program. The price support program 
for peanuts was extended through 2002, but the quota support 
rate was lowered from $678/ton to $610/ton. The price support 
escalator was eliminated. The legislation eliminated the 
national poundage quota floor (currently 1,350,000 tons) and 
undermarketing provisions of current law. Previously considered 
reforms for quota reduction, the sale, lease and transfer of 
quota across county lines, and offers from handlers were 
removed from the bill due to Byrd Rule considerations in the 
House-Senate conference.
            Sugar
    In order to make the program more market-oriented, a 
recourse loan system was implemented until imports reach 1.5 
million short tons for FY 1997-2002. The bill terminated 
marketing allotments and implement a one cent penalty on 
forfeited sugar. Provisions of current law that require the 
Sugar Program to operate at no-net cost were retained in this 
bill. It also retained the loan rate for raw cane sugar and 
refined beet sugar at the 1995 levels, 18 cents and 22.9 cents 
respectively, and retained a nine-month loan. The legislation 
would have raised the assessment on sugar processors to achieve 
$52 million in budget savings over seven years toward deficit 
reduction.
            Nonrecourse marketing assistance loans
    The conference agreement established maximum loan rates at 
the following (1995) levels:
          Rice: $6.50/cwt
          Upland Cotton: $0.5192/lb
          Wheat: $2.58/bu
          Corn: $1.89/bu
          Soybeans: $4.92/bu
          ELS Cotton: $0.7965/lb.
    The Secretary would retain authority to make downward 
adjustments to wheat and feed grains loan rates based on 
specified stocks-to-use criteria. The bill also established a 
minimum loan rate for rice at $6.50/cwt and cotton at $0.50/lb. 
The conference agreement also eliminated the 8-month cotton 
loan extension. The loan rate provisions of the conference 
agreement would have saved $107 million.
            Payment limitations
    The conference agreement reduced the current payment 
limitation by 20 percent, from $50,000 to $40,000. The bill 
extends provisions of current law that limit marketing loan 
gains and loan deficiency payments to $75,000 per person per 
year. The payment limitation reduction achieved $150 million in 
budget savings.
            Program authority elimination
    This legislation repealed the Agriculture Act of 1949 as 
well as the permanent law provisions of the Agriculture 
Adjustment Act of 1938. Also eliminated were authorities for 
the Farmer Owned Reserve and the Emergency Livestock Feed 
Assistance Program.
            Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
    The CRP was capped at the current level of 36.4 million 
acres for a savings of $569 million over seven years. Also 
adopted was an ``early out'' provision to allow contract 
holders to terminate CRP contracts upon written notification of 
the Secretary.
            Livestock Environmental Assistance Program (LEAP)
    The program was established to help livestock producers 
improve environmental and water quality. The program made 
available $100 million annually to provide technical and cost-
share assistance in implementing structural and management 
practices to protect water, soil and related resources from 
degradation associated with livestock production.
            Market Promotion Program (MPP)
    MPP expenditures were capped at $100 million through 2002 
producing a savings of $60 million.
            Export Enhancement Program (EEP)
    EEP expenditures were capped at $350 million in 1996 and 
1997; $500 million in 1998; $550 million in 1999; $579 million 
in 2000 and $478 million for 2001 and 2002. Total savings from 
EEP to be $1.27 billion.
            Crop insurance
    The bill eliminated the mandatory nature of catastrophic 
crop insurance, but required producers to waive all federal 
disaster assistance if they opt not to purchase insurance. Dual 
delivery of crop insurance was eliminated in those states that 
have adequate private crop insurance delivery. The bill also 
corrected a provision of current law by amending the Federal 
Crop Insurance Act to include seed crops. The crop insurance 
provisions of the bill resulted in net savings of $130 million.
            Agriculture quarantine and inspection
    The bill amended the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and 
Trade Act of 1990 to allow the Secretary to collect and spend 
fees collected over $100 million to cover the cost of providing 
quarantine and inspection services for imports.
            Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) interest rates
    Rates on CCC agriculture commodity loans were increased by 
100 basis points for a savings of $260 million over seven 
years.
            National Weather Service
    Stipulated that the National Weather Service will not 
compete with the private sector when a weather service is 
provided, or can be provided by commercial enterpirse. This 
would have ultimately resulted in privatization of the 
Agricultural Weather Service.
            Seafood inspection
    Stipulates that the seafood inspection activities of the 
National Marine Fisheries Services, would be transferred to the 
National Institute for Science and Technology.
            Food stamps and commodity distribution reform
    Most of the provisions of title X and relevant provisions 
of title XI of the Conference Report to H.R. 4 were 
incorporated into H.R. 2491, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, 
as subtitle J of title XII.
    (Note: For discussion of H.R. 4, see Part II, C ``3. Bills 
Vetoed'' supra.)
    Based on the reforms to the Food Stamp Program in subtitle 
J of title XII of H.R. 2491, projected growth was reduced by 
$27.8 billion over seven years relative to preamendment law.
    While similar, subtitle J of title XII of H.R. 2491 
differed from title X and relevant provisions of title XI in 
the Conference to H.R. 4, inter alia, in the following ways:
          The Food Stamp Program was not reauthorized, nor was 
        any limitation placed on the obligational authority of 
        the Secretary;
          Criminal forfeiture authority was not provided; and
          An exemption for means-tested benefits established or 
        administered by state or local governments from the 
        Federal Reserve Board's ``Regulation E'' was not 
        provided.

H.R. 1530, Department of Defense Authorization Act for 1996

    H.R. 1530 was initially passed by the House of 
Representatives on June 15, 1995, and contained provisions 
dealing solely with the Department of Defense authorization. In 
amending the bill on September 6, 1995, the Senate added 
sections 2851 through 2857, that contained provisions similar 
to H.R. 714, the ``Illinois Land Conservation Act'', which was 
reported by the Committee on Agriculture and also passed by the 
House of Representatives on July 31, 1995.
    The Committee on Agriculture was appointed as conferees to 
H.R. 1530 on September 21, 1995. Language contained in the 
conference report 104-406 to accompany H.R. 1530 was language 
similar to that in H.R. 714 as previously passed by the House 
of Representative with modifications that:
          (1) made technical corrections;
          (2) authorized the Secretary of the Army to transfer 
        982 acres of real property to the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs to establish a national cemetery;
          (3) authorized the Secretary of the Army to convey to 
        Will County, Illinois, without consideration an amount 
        of 455 acres of real property for use as a landfill;
          (4) authorized the Secretary of the Army to convey to 
        the State of Illinois, at fair market value, 3,000 
        acres of real property to the State of Illinois for 
        economic redevelopment. The State of Illinois was to be 
        required to pay the Army fair market value for the 
        property within twenty years after the date of the 
        conveyance; and
          (5) required the Governor of the State of Illinois to 
        consult with the Mayors of the Village of Elwood, 
        Illinois, and the City of Wilmington, Illinois, in 
        establishing a redevelopment authority to oversee the 
        conveyance, and the development as well as the 
        environmental remediation and restoration of the real 
        property comprising the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant.
    On December 28, 1995, the President vetoed H.R. 1530. The 
House of Representatives on January 3, 1996, failed to over-
ride the Presidential Veto Message by a vote of 240 yeas to 156 
nays.
    (Note.--See also discussion of H.R. 714, the Illinois 
Conservation Land Act in part II C, ``5. Bills Acted on by the 
House But Not the Senate'' and ``2. Bills Acted on by the 
Committee Included in Other Laws Enacted''.)

            4. bills acted on by both houses but not enacted

Other bills

    One bill was acted on by other authorizing committees of 
the House and Senate, but not acted on by the House Committee 
on Agriculture, which contained provisions relating to matters 
within the Committee's jurisdiction. The following is a 
abbreviated summary of this bill:
            H.R. 1296, the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management 
                    Act of 1996
    H.R. 1296, the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management 
Act of 1996, was the predecessor to H.R. 4236 (see Public Law 
104-333 (H.R. 4236) under ``1. Bills Enacted Into Law''). H.R. 
1296 was reported by the Committee on Resources on August 4, 
1996 (H.Rept. 104-234) and passed the House of Representatives 
on September 18, 1995.
    The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 
reported H.R. 1296, as amended (S.Rept. 104-202) on January 5, 
1996. On May 1, 1996, H.R. 1296 passed the Senate.
    H.R. 1296 was then the subject of a House-Senate Conference 
with a Conference Report filed on September 24, 1996 (H.Rept. 
104-836). This Conference Report was never considered by either 
body but lead to the introduction of H.R. 4236.
    In addition to those sections affecting this Committee's 
jurisdiction described in H.R. 4236, H.R. 1296 contained the 
following additional sections that were not included as part of 
H.R. 4236 which was later enacted into law as Public Law 104-
333:
          Section 701 relating to recreational fee charges by 
        the Secretary of Agriculture on Forest Service lands; 
        and
          Section 1038 relating to the Secretary of 
        Agriculture's authority under a Forest Service timber 
        contract.

           5. BILLS ACTED ON BY THE HOUSE BUT NOT THE SENATE

H.R. 714, Illinois Land Conservation Act

     The Illinois Land Conservation Act of 1995 was introduced 
and referred to the Committee on Agriculture and in addition to 
the Committees on National Security, Commerce, and 
Transportation and Infrastructure.
     The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
reported H.R. 714, as amended, on July 18, 1995 (H.Rept. 104-
191 part I). The Committee on Agriculture reported H.R. 714, as 
amended on July 28, 1995 (H.Rept. 104-191 part II). H.R. 714 
was then discharged from further consideration from the 
Committees on National Security and Commerce and passed by the 
House of Representatives by a voice vote pursuant to a 
unanimous consent request on July 31, 1995.
     This bill would have converted the Army ammunition plant 
located at Joliet, Illinois, to a tallgrass prairie called the 
Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie. The Joliet Army Ammunition 
Plant (Arsenal) would have been converted by transferring part 
of the Arsenal from the Department of the Army to the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture.
     Transfers amounted to about 1,600 acres to the Midewin 
National Tallgrass Prairie that would be administered by the 
U.S. Forest Service and an additional 3,000 acres would be 
transferred when the Department of the Army completed an 
environmental cleanup that has begun on the property.
     Under the bill's authority, the Army also would have 
transferred about 1,000 acres to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs to establish to a national cemetery; about 455 acres 
would be transferred to Will County, Illinois, to operate a 
landfill, and around 3,000 acres would be transferred by the 
State of Illinois for economic development.
     The bill also makes all transfers without compensation 
unless the State sells the land in which case, the State would 
be obligated to reimburse the U.S. government for the fair 
market value of the land.
    (Note.--For further action on this provision, see part II C 
``3. Vetoed Bills'' and ``2. Bills Acted on by the Committee 
Included in Other Laws Enacted'' supra.)

H.R. 1527, to amend the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 to 
        clarify the authorities and duties of the Secretary of 
        Agriculture in issuing ski area permits on National Forest 
        System lands and to withdraw lands within ski area permit 
        boundaries from the operation of the mining and mineral leasing 
        laws

     H.R. 1527 was introduced and referred to the Committee on 
Resources with an additional referred to the Committee on 
Agriculture. On April 15, 1996, the Committee on Resources 
reported H.R. 1527, as amended. (See H.Rept. 104-516 part I.)
     In the report filed by the Committee on Resources is a 
copy of an exchange of letters between the respective Chairman 
of the Committees (Resources and Agriculture) explaining the 
reasons for expediting this legislation. Therefore, on April 
15, 1996, the Committee on Agriculture waived a referral and 
was discharged from further consideration. The bill, H.R. 1527 
was then passed by the House of Representatives on April 30, 
1996 by a voice vote under suspension of the rules.
     Major provisions of the bill--
          (1) provided that the Secretary of Agriculture shall 
        charge ski area permittees for rental of Forest Service 
        lands under permit. Permittees with permits issued 
        pursuant to a 1986 permit act shall be required to pay 
        a rental charge calculated according to a new method 
        outlined in this act. Permittees with permit issued 
        pursuant and prior to the 1986 Permit Act are given the 
        opportunity to use the new calculation system, but 
        otherwise may continue to calculate their rental charge 
        in accordance with their existing permits;
          (2) sets forth the formula under the ski area permit 
        rental charge (SAPRC) will be imposed and calculated 
        for ski areas on or partially on National Forests, 
        including Nordic ski areas. It directs annual 
        adjustments of each revenue bracket's adjusted gross 
        revenue figures by the percent increase or decrease in 
        the Consumer Price Index;
          (3) provides that scheduling of rental charge 
        payments will be made on an annual basis, with monthly, 
        quarterly or other payments or prepayments to be 
        determined by the Forest Service and individual ski 
        areas;
          (4) provides that the new legislated rental charges 
        shall become effective on June 1, 1996 and cover 
        receipts retroactive to June 1, 1995. However, if a 
        permittee has paid rental charges for the period June 
        1, 1995, to June 1, 1996, under the existing graduated 
        rate fee system formula, this payment constitutes a 
        credit toward the new rental charge. To ensure that the 
        United States would receive increased rental charge 
        receipts during a three-year transition from the 
        existing graduated rate fee system to the new system, a 
        floor was placed on each individual ski area's payment 
        under which every area would pay the higher of the 
        1994-1995 rental charge or the rental charge 
        calculated;
          (5) prohibits revenue or subpermittee revenue (other 
        than lift ticket, area use pass, or ski school sales) 
        obtained from operations located on non-National Forest 
        land from being included in the SAPRC calculation;
          (6) defines revenue and sales, and provides, in cases 
        where an area of National Forest land is under a ski 
        area permit (but the permittee does not have revenue or 
        sales qualifying for rental charge payment) payment of 
        an annual minimum rental fee of $2 per National Forest 
        acre under permit, or percentage of appraised land 
        value, as determined by the Secretary;
          (7) directs that new rental charges be phased in over 
        a five-year period for acres where the new rental 
        charge results in an increase greater than one-half of 
        1 percent of the permittee's adjusted gross revenue;
          (8) states that the reissuance of a ski area permit 
        to provide activities similar in nature and amount to 
        those activities currently being provided at the ski 
        area does not constitute a major Federal action under 
        the National Environmental Policy Act; and
          (9) withdraws lands under a ski area permit from 
        appropriation under mining, mineral leasing and 
        geothermal leasing laws for the full term of the permit 
        and its modification, reissuing, or renewal. It further 
        provides that, unless requested by the Secretary, the 
        withdrawal shall terminate automatically upon 
        expiration or termination of the permit and that the 
        land be made available for all uses not otherwise 
        restricted under the public land laws.

H.R. 2122, to designate the Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest in the 
        States of California and Nevada to be administered by the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, and for other purposes

    H.R. 2122 was introduced and referred to the Committee on 
Resources, and in addition, to the Committee on Agriculture. On 
September 4, 1996, H.R. 2122 was reported, as amended, by the 
Committee on Resources (H.Rept. 104-772 part I) and passed by 
the House of Representatives by a voice vote under suspension 
of the rules.
    The bill designated the Lake Tahoe Basin National Forest, 
created from lands within the Tahoe, Eldorado, and Toiyobe 
National Forest. The legislation also designated the Lake Tahoe 
Basin National Forest to be a unit of the National Forest 
System, subject to the laws, rules and regulations applicable 
to the National Forest System.
    (Note.--On August 15, 1996, the Committee on Agriculture 
waived further consideration of H.R. 2122 by letter to the 
Chairman of the Committee on Resources in the interest of 
expediting the passage of the legislation.)

H.R. 2670, Release of Reversionary Interest--Iosco County, Michigan

    H.R. 2670 was reported, amended, by the Committee on 
Agriculture (H.Rept. 104-644) on June 27, 1996, and passed by 
the House of Representatives on August 1, 1996.
    The bill was intended to clear title on 1.92 acres of real 
property in order to facilitate a land exchange under the Small 
Tracts Act of 1983. The 1.92 acres in real property was 
provided to Iosco County for an airport but a reversionary 
interest was retained by the United States in the event that 
property was ever used for another purpose. Due to a survey 
error, the property has been in private use. The private party 
has agreed to provide real property of equal value to Iosco 
County in exchange for 1.92 acres. A release of the 
reversionary interest held by the United States was necessary 
to carry out this exchange.

H.R. 2711, to provide for the substitution of timber for the canceled 
        Elkhorn Ridge Timber Sale

    H.R. 2711 was introduced and referred to the Committee on 
Agriculture, and in addition, to the Committee on Resources.
    On September 4, 1996, the Committee on Resource reported 
(H.Rept. 104-761 part I) without amendment, and H.R. 2711 
passed the House of Representatives by a voice vote under 
suspension of the rules.
    The bill authorized the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to 
substitute, without competition, a contract for timber 
identified for harvest located on public lands administered by 
the BLM in the State of California of comparable value for the 
following terminated timber contract: Elkhorn Ridge Timber 
Sale, Contact No. CA-050-TS-88-01.
    (Note.--On July 24, 1996, the Committee on Agriculture 
waived further consideration of H.R. 2711 by letter to the 
Chairman of the Committee on Resources in the interest of 
expediting the passage of the legislation in the House.)

H.R. 2941, to improve the quantity and quality of the quarters of land 
        management agency field employees, and for other purposes

    H.R. 2941 was introduced and referred to the Committee on 
Resources, and in addition, to the Committee on Agriculture.
    On September 17, 1996, H.R. 2941 was reported, amended by 
the Committee on Resources (H.Rept. 104-802 part I) and passed 
by the House of Representatives by a voice vote under 
suspension of the rules.
    (Note.--In reporting H.R. 2941, the Committee on Resources 
removed all of the Committee on Agriculture's jurisdictional 
interest in H.R. 2941 which was based on its effect on living 
quarters for National Forest Service employees. Therefore, in 
an exchange of letters between the respective Chairmen of the 
Committees, the Committee on Agriculture waived its further 
consideration of the measure on August 29, 1996).

H.R. 3387, J. Phil Campbell Senior Natural Resource Conservation Center

    H.R. 3387 was reported, by the Committee on Agriculture 
(H.Rept. 104-645) on June 27, 1996, and passed by the House of 
Representatives on August 1, 1996.
    The bill was intended to designate the Southern Piedmont 
Conservation Research Center in Watkinsville, Georgia as the 
``J. Phil Campbell. Sr. Natural Resource Conservation Center.'' 
This designation was in recognition of Mr. Campbells' lifelong 
service to agriculture and conservation.
    (Note.--H.R. 3387 was originally referred to the Committee 
on Resources when it was introduced on May 1, 1996. Mr. Hansen 
on May 14, 1996 initiated a rereferral of H.R. 3387 to the 
Committee on Agriculture by discharging the Committee on 
Resources from further consideration).

H.R. 3464, to make a minor adjustment in the exterior boundary of the 
        Devils Backbone Wilderness in the Mark Twain National Forest, 
        Missouri, to exclude a small parcel of land containing 
        improvements

    H.R. 3464 was reported, amended, by the Committee on 
Agriculture (H.Rept. 104-654 part I) on June 27, 1996 and 
passed by the House of Representatives on August 1, 1996.
    The bill was intended to provide relief to a private party 
who made improvements to the two acres in real property relying 
upon an incorrect survey. The improvements included a water 
well, mailing box, driveway, and garage. It is estimated that 
relevant property boundaries have been incorrectly described in 
surveys for the last 100 years. By excluding the two acres from 
the Devil's Backbone Wilderness, the bill would permit the 
invocation of the Small Tracts Act of 1983 which, in turn, 
would allow for a land exchange or other appropriate remedy.
    (Note.--H.R. 3464 was referred to the Committee on 
Agriculture, and in addition, to the Committee on Resources. 
Committee on Resources was discharged from further 
consideration on June 27, 1996.)

H.R. 3562, Wisconsin Works

    H.R. 3562, a bill to authorize the State of Wisconsin to 
implement the demonstration projection known as ``Wisconsin 
Works'' was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, and in 
addition, to the Committees on Agriculture, Economic and 
Educational Opportunities, and Commerce.
    On June 6, 1996, H.R. 3562 passed the House of 
Representatives, as amended, by a vote of 363 yeas to 59 nays.
    The Wisconsin Works Program offers its participants the 
opportunity to earn wages and to learn how to increase their 
value to employers. The consistent theme in the Wisconsin Works 
Program is the expectation of personal responsibility and the 
goal of independence and a promising future for welfare 
participants. However, this can not be done without reducing 
the mandates of the Federal Government.
    Therefore, waivers with respect to the Food Stamp Program 
are incorporated in this bill to provide Wisconsin the ability 
to match its program with the Food Stamp Program in the areas 
of certification, employment and training programs, and work 
requirements. Additionally, for those persons in the Wisconsin 
Works Program who also receive food stamps, food benefits will 
be provided in cash. The Wisconsin program also includes a 
mandatory nutrition education program for which it believes for 
its participants to become self-sufficient, they need to know 
how to budget for food purchases, without the parameters 
specified by the use of food coupons. Wisconsin estimates that 
approximately half of the families receiving food stamps will 
be provided with cash instead of food stamps with the enactment 
of H.R. 3562.

H.R. 3665, Census of Agriculture Act of 1996

    H.R. 3665, a bill to transfer the authority to conduct the 
census of agriculture to the Secretary of Agriculture from the 
Secretary of Commerce was reported, amended, by the Committee 
on Agriculture (H.Rept. 104-653 part I) and passed by the House 
of Representatives on July 22, 1996.
    Every five years, a census of agriculture is conducted to 
gather county-level statistics on agriculture operations 
throughout the United States. The data is used to prepare 
estimates of farm income and production costs, evaluate 
agriculture programs and policies, to administer farm programs, 
and to plan for operations during disease or pest emergencies. 
The Farm Credit Administration uses the data to evaluate loan 
programs, while local and state authorities use the statistics 
to analyze and develop policies on land and water use, and to 
forecast future energy needs.
    Over the past few years, it has become increasingly 
difficult for the Census Bureau to continue to be the lead 
agency for the Census of Agriculture because of budgetary 
constraints. The Agriculture Appropriations for FY 1997 (P.L. 
104-180) provided funding for the Department of Agriculture to 
conduct the census.
    (Note.--H.R. 3665 was referred to the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight, and in addition to the 
Committee on Agriculture. The Committee on Agriculture reported 
H.R. 3665, as amended, on June 27, 1996 after the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight waived further consideration in 
the interest of expediting passage of the legislation.)

H.R. 3900, to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to provide 
        greater planting flexibility, and for other purposes

    On July 26, 1996, H.R. 3900 passed the House of 
Representatives, as amended, after the Committee on Agriculture 
was discharged from further consideration.
    The bill simply allows farmers to plant a secondary crop of 
fruits or vegetables on their farm program acreage following a 
crop which has failed earlier in the year. This practice, 
referred to as ``ghost acres'', has been allowed for several 
years, but was being disallowed due to the interpretation of 
the new farm bill (P.L. 104-127) by USDA. Allowing this 
practice clarifies the intent of Congress and does not violate 
the spirit or the letter of any agreements made on the issue of 
planting flexibility under the new farm bill.
    The bill also requires the issuance of new regulations by 
the Department of Agriculture for the Conservation Reserve 
Program by September 15th. This requirement was needed because 
rural Americans had already waited too long to hear what the 
details of the new CRP program will be and needed to make 
decisions as to the future use of their land.

H.R. 4041, to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to convey a parcel 
        of unused agricultural land in Dos Palos, California, to the 
        Dos Palos Ag Boosters for use as a farm school

    H.R. 4041 passed the House of Representatives by a voice 
vote under suspension of the Rules on September 27, 1996.
    The bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture to convey 
a parcel of unused agricultural land in Dos Palos, California, 
which consists of approximately 22 acres, to the Dos Palos Ag 
Boosters to be used as a farm school. The Dos Palos Ag Boosters 
would pay the department the fair market value of the land in 
exchange for the rights, title, and interest to the parcel.

H. Con. Res. 181, expressing the sense of Congress that the Secretary 
        of Agriculture should dispose of all remaining commodities in 
        the disaster reserve maintained under the Agricultural Act of 
        1970 to relieve the distress of livestock producers whose 
        ability to maintain livestock is adversely affected by the 
        prolonged drought conditions existing in certain areas of the 
        United States

    For a description of H. Con. Res. 181, see the discussion 
on S. Con. Res. 63 in ``6. Concurrent Resolutions Approved''.

Other bills

    Several bills acted on by other authorizing committees of 
the House that passed the House of Representatives, but were 
not acted on by the Committee on Agriculture, contained 
provisions relating to matters within the Committee's 
jurisdiction. Following are abbreviated summaries of these 
bills:
            H.R. 9, Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995
    H.R. 9, the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995 
was part of the ``Contract With America'' and was referred to 
the Committee on Ways and Means, and in addition to the 
Committee on Commerce, Government Reform and Oversight, Budget, 
Rules, the Judiciary and Science.
    On February 15, 1995, the Committee on Commerce and the 
Committee on Science reported H.R. 9 (H.Rept 104-33 part I and 
II). On March 3, the House struck all after section 1 and 
inserted in lieu thereof the provisions of a text composed as 4 
divisions: (1) H.R. 830; (2) H.R. 925; (3) H.R. 926; and (4) 
H.R 1022, as each bill had been previously passed by the House 
of Representatives. H.R. 9 was then passed by the House of 
Representatives by a vote of 277 yeas to 141 nays.
    Issues related to this Committee's jurisdiction, in H.R. 9 
as passed included compensation for farmers and ranchers whose 
property had been devalued through regulatory action by the 
Federal government; congressional review of Federal agency 
rulemaking action, including regulations issued by the 
Department of Agriculture, and requirements of USDA to perform 
risk assessment and cost benefit analyses with regard to 
regulatory actions.
    (Note.--See also H.R. 925, and H.R. 1022 of this section 
``5. Bills Acted on By the House But Not the Senate''.)
            H.R. 925, Private Property Protection Act of 1995
    H.R. 925, the Private Property Protection Act of 1995, was 
introduced and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. On 
February 23, 1995, the Committee on the Judiciary reported H.R. 
925, as amended (H.Rept. 104-46). On March 3, 1995, H.R. 925 
passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 277 yeas to 
148 nays. However, also on March 3, 1995, pursuant to the 
provision of H.Res. 101, the House incorporated the text of 
this measure, as passed by the House into H.R. 9, the Job 
Creation and Wage Enhancement Act of 1995.
    Issues related to this Committee's jurisdiction in H.R. 925 
included compensation for farmers and ranchers whose property 
has been devalued through regulatory action by the Federal 
government.
    (Note.--See also H.R. 9, the Job Creation and Wage 
Enhancement Act of 1995 in this section ``5. Bills Acted on By 
the House But Not the Senate''.)
            H.R. 961, Clean Water Amendments of 1995
    H.R. 961, the Clean Water Amendments of 1995 was introduced 
and referred to the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure.
    On May 2, 1995 the respective Chairman of this Committee by 
letter indicated to the Chairman of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure, this Committee's right to a 
sequential referral based on the treatment and definition of 
wetlands under Federal law, which has a direct impact on the 
treatment of wetlands under the Food Security Act of 1985, as 
amended, with regard to farmers and ranchers receiving Federal 
farm program benefits.
    However, this Committee in the interest of expediting the 
consideration of H.R. 961 did not seek a sequential referral 
and H.R. 961 was then reported by the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure (H.Rept. 104-112) on May 3, 
1995. On May 16, 1995, H.R. 961 passed the House of 
Representatives by a vote of 240 yeas to 185 nays.
            H.R. 1022, Risk Assessment and Cost-Benefit Act of 1995
    H.R. 1022 was introduced and referred to the Committee on 
Science, and in addition to the Committees on Commerce, and 
Government Reform and Oversight.
    On February 28, 1995, H.R. 1022 passed the House of 
Representatives by a vote of 286 yeas to 141 nays.
    Issues of concern to this Committee included in H.R. 1022 
related to the requirements of USDA to perform risk assessment 
and cost benefit analyses with regard to regulatory actions.
    However, pursuant to provisions of H.Res. 101, the House 
incorporated the text of this measure, as passed by the House 
into H.R. 9 on March 3, 1995.
    (Note.--See also H.R. 9, the Job Creation and Wage 
Enhancement Act of 1995 in this section ``5. Bills Acted on By 
the House But Not the Senate''.)
            H.R. 1675, National Wildlife Refuge Improvement Act of 1995
    H.R. 1675 was introduced and referred solely to the 
Committee on Resources. However, when the Committee on 
Resources reported H.R. 1675, as amended, (see H.Rept. 104-218) 
it contained language regarding the use of chemicals and other 
pesticide control measures on two National Wildlife Refuges 
located in Oregon and California.
    In July of 1995, the respective Chairmen of the Committees 
exchanged letters and the Committee on Agriculture waived its 
right to a sequential referral of the bill based on the bill's 
bipartisan support. H.R. 1675 was then passed by the House of 
Representatives on April 24, 1996 by a vote of 287 yeas to 138 
nays.
            H.R. 3322, Omnibus Civilian Science Authorization Act of 
                    1996
    H.R. 3322 was introduced and referred to the Committee on 
Science, and in addition to the Committee on Resources, 
Transportation and Infrastructure, and National Security.
    On May 1, 1996, the Committee on Science reported H.R. 
3322, as amended (see H.Rept. 104-550 part I). On May 30, 1996, 
H.R. 3322 passed the House of Representatives which included 
provisions that would have disallowed the National Weather 
Service from performing tasks that the private sector could 
perform, thereby eliminating the Agricultural Weather Service.
    (Note.--See also the discussion on H.R. 1756 in ``7. Bills 
Reported to the House But Not Considered'' and the discussion 
of H.R. 2491 in ``3. Bills Vetoed'').

                   6. CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS APPROVED

S. Con. Res. 63, to express the sense of Congress that the Secretary of 
        Agriculture should dispose of all remaining commodities in the 
        disaster reserve maintained under the Agricultural Act of 1970 
        to relieve the distress of livestock producers whose ability to 
        maintain livestock is adversely affected by disaster conditions 
        existing in certain areas of the United States, such as 
        prolonged drought or flooding, and for other purposes

    On June 5, 1996, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry was discharged from further 
consideration and S. Con. Res. 63 passed the Senate, as 
amended, by unanimous consent.
    On June 12, 1996, the Committee on Agriculture was 
discharged from further consideration and S. Con. Res. 63 
passed the House of Representatives by a voice vote under a 
unanimous consent request.
    The Agricultural Act of 1970 established a national grain 
disaster reserve which is managed by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation, containing wheat, feed grains, and soybeans. The 
reserve can be released (sold to individual farmers) at the 
discretion of the Department of Agriculture in time of a 
presidentially-declared natural disaster, or if Congress were 
to pass aconcurrent resolution declaring that such reserves 
could be released. The grain reserve was holding about 46 
million bushels of feed grains, worth an estimated $200 
million, which had not been used but held merely as a reserve 
in recent years.
    This grain was in great need for use by farmers in parts of 
the United States, particularly in the Southern Plains, which 
had been plagued by drought since last fall. Livestock 
producers, in particular, were hurt by increased grain prices, 
diminished livestock prices, and the drought.
    (Note.--On June 4, 1996, H. Con. Res. 181 (companion 
resolution to S. Con. Res. 63) passed the House of 
Representatives by a voice vote under suspension of the rule.)

           7. BILLS REPORTED TO THE HOUSE BUT NOT CONSIDERED

H.R. 1135

    On March 7, 1995, the Committee considered and reported 
H.R. 1135, the Food Stamp Reform and Commodity Distribution 
Act, favorably to the House. The provisions of H.R. 1135 were 
incorporated into title V of H.R. 1214, the Personal 
Responsibility Act of 1995. The provisions of title V of H.R. 
1214 were subsequently incorporated into title XI of H.R. 4.
    (Note.--For discussion of H.R. 4, see Part II, C ``3. Bill 
Vetoed'' supra.)
    H.R. 1135 made extensive reforms to the food stamp program. 
Based on these reforms, projected growth in the food stamp 
program would have been reduced by $21.4 billion over five 
years relative to preamendment law.
    Four Department of Agriculture commodity distribution 
programs were also consolidated into a single distribution 
program. The bill authorized $300 million per year through 
fiscal year 2000 to purchase commodities for distribution.
    States were permitted to harmonize food stamp program rules 
with those of the state Temporary Assistance for Needy Families 
(TANF) program for those families receiving benefits from both 
programs.
    Monthly food stamp benefits were adjusted by two percent 
each year.
    Deductions from income were maintained at preamendment 
levels.
    The threshold above which the fair market value of vehicles 
is counted as an asset in determining eligibility was 
maintained at $4,550.
    Limits were placed on the eligibility of aliens.
    Able-bodied individuals between the age of 18 and 50 who 
have no dependents must work 20 hours a week or participate in 
a state workfare or training program within 90 days of 
certification of their food stamp eligibility.
    States may operate work supplementation or support programs 
under which the value of public assistance benefits, including 
food stamps, are provided to employers who hire recipients and, 
in turn, use the benefits to supplement the wages paid to the 
recipient.
    The same penalty was applied for individuals failing to 
comply with the rules of a state TANF programs as those failing 
to comply with the food stamp recipient.
    To encourage states to implement Electronic Benefit 
Transfer systems, states that have implemented EBT on a 
statewide basis were allowed to operate the food stamp program 
under a block grant.
    Improved food stamp program management by the states were 
encouraged by establishing more strict quality control 
measures.
    The amount of funds obligated by the Secretary were not to 
exceed the cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office for 
the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, with adjustments for 
additional fiscal years taking into account the amendments made 
by this bill.

H.R. 1756, Department of Commerce Dismantling Act

    H.R. 1756, the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act, was 
introduced and referred to the Committee on Commerce, and in 
addition to the Committees on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, Banking and Financial Services, International 
Relations, National Security, Agriculture, Ways and Means, 
Government Reform and Oversight, the Judiciary, Science, and 
Resources.
    The Committee on Agriculture examined matters contained in 
section 211(n)(3) of H.R. 1756 relating to the transfer of the 
seafood inspection services performed by the National Marine 
Fisheries Service, an agency of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration to the Department of Agriculture.
    The Committee also examined section 211 (l)(1)(A) and 
(m)(2)(A) that would have terminated ``specialized 
agriculture'' and ``forestry weather services'' of the National 
Weather Service and its ``regional Climate Center''.
    The Committee made no recommendation regarding any change 
in the language of section 211(n)(3) as it related to seafood 
inspection transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture. However, 
with respect to section 211 (l)(1)(A) and (m)(2)(A) that would 
terminate specialized agriculture and forestry weather services 
of the National Weather Services, the Committee proposed 
amendments that had been recommended by the Department of 
Agriculture.
    Based on the foregoing, the Committee, in order to expedite 
the consideration of H.R. 1756, requested that its language 
changes to H.R. 1756 be adopted and assuming that these changes 
were agreeable, agreed to waive its right to further 
consideration of the bill.
    (Note.--On September 21, 1995 the Committee on Ways Means 
reported H.R. 1756, as amended (see H.Rept. 104-260 part I). 
However, for further discussion of provisions within the 
Committee's jurisdiction on H.R. 1756, see discussion of H.R. 
2491 in part II C ``3. Bills Vetoed'', supra, and H.R. 3322 in 
part II C ``5. Bills Acted on by the House But Not the 
Senate'', supra.)

H.R. 2130, Farmer Mac Reform Act of 1995

    H.R. 2130, the Farmer Mac Reform Act of 1995, makes 
substantial changes in Title VII of the Farm Credit Act of 
1971, as amended, governing the secondary market for 
agricultural real estate and rural housing loans. These loans 
are originated by commercial banks and the cooperative farm 
credit system as well as by insurance companies and the 
securities are guaranteed by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage 
Corporation, also known as ``Farmer Mac''.
    The bill would significantly change the way Farmer Mac does 
business by liberalizing the institution's charter, allowing it 
to pool loans in a similar fashion to other government-
sponsored secondary markets (such as ``Fannie Mae'' and 
``Freddie Mac'') and allowing it to assume greater credit risk 
by eliminating the requirement that each pool of loans must be 
backed up by a 10 percent subordinated interest or cash 
reserve. During the three-year period following the bill's 
enactment, Farmer Mac's statutory minimum capital requirements 
also would be liberalized. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) 
Office of Secondary Market Oversight (OSMO) would be given an 
additional three years following enactment to implement risk-
based capital requirements for Farmer Mac.
    The legislation required Farmer Mac to recapitalize its 
core capital base to at least $25 million within two years 
following enactment or within six months after Farmer Mac's 
aggregate on-balance sheet assets equal or exceed $2 billion, 
whichever occurs first.
    In addition, the legislation amended those sections of 
current law that would streamline Farmer Mac's business 
operations, such as requiring the Federal Reserve Banks to act 
as depositories and fiscal agents for Farmer Mac's securities 
and providing for Farmer Mac's access to the book-entry system 
of the Federal Reserve System.
    (Note.--H.R. 2130 was referred primarily to the Committee 
on Agriculture. On January 4, 1996, when the Committee on 
Agriculture reported H.R. 2130, as amended (see H.Rept. 104-446 
part I), the bill was then sequentially referred to the 
Committee on Banking and Financial Services for a period ending 
not later than March 15, 1996. On March 15, 1996 the Committee 
on Banking and Financial Service was discharged from further 
consideration and no further action was taken on H.R. 2130. 
However, some of the provisions of H.R. 2130 were incorporated 
by a Senate Amendment into H.R. 2029 which was enacted into 
Public Law 104-105. For a description of P.L. 104-105, see the 
discussion under part II C ``1. Bills Enacted Into Law'', 
supra.)

H.R. 2275, to reauthorize and amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973

    Prior to the introduction of H.R. 2275, confirmation of a 
memorandum of understanding that clarified the jurisdiction 
over certain legislation which effects endangered species was 
reached between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee 
on Resources.
    Therefore, when H.R. 2275 was introduced, it was referred 
to the Committee on Resources, and in addition to the Committee 
on Agriculture.
    On September 9, 1996, the Committee on Resources reported 
H.R. 2275, as amended (see H.Rept. 104-778 part I), and the 
Committee on Agriculture was discharged from further 
consideration. However, on January 23, 1996, the Committee on 
Agriculture stated in a letter to the Committee on Resources 
that it was convinced that the Committee on Resources had 
produced legislation that was in the best interests of 
agricultural producers and that it would not undertake further 
consideration of H.R. 2275.

S. 1459, Public Rangelands Management Act of l996

    S. 1459, to provide for uniform management of livestock 
grazing on Federal lands, passed the Senate on March 21, 1996 
and was referred to the Committee on Resources and in addition 
to the Committee on Agriculture on March 26, 1996.
    On July 10, 1996, the Committee on Agriculture waived 
further consideration of S. 1459 in the interest of expediting 
its consideration in the House. Therefore, on July 12, 1996, 
the Committee on Resources reported S. 1459, as amended (see 
H.Rept. 104-674 part I).

Other bills

    One bill was acted on by other authorizing committee of the 
House and reported, but not referred to or acted on by the 
Committee on Agriculture, which contained provisions relating 
to matters within the Committee's jurisdiction. Following is a 
abbreviated summary of this bill:
            H.R. 2107, Visitor Services Improvement and Outdoor Legacy 
                    Act of 1996
    H.R. 2107 as introduced was referred solely to the 
Committee on Resources. However on July 23, 1996, the 
respective Chairmen of these Committees exchanged letters and 
the Committee on Agriculture waived its right to a sequential 
referral of H.R. 2107 in the interest of expediting the 
consideration of the legislation in the House.
    On September 4, 1996 the Committee on Resources reported 
H.R. 2107 as amended (see H.Rept. 104-757). This bill as 
amended, would have affected fees within National Forest System 
units not created from public domain that are within the 
jurisdiction of this Committee.

                     8. BILLS DEFEATED IN THE HOUSE

    None.

                9. OTHER BILLS ACTED ON BY THE COMMITTEE

H.R. 1997, Food Stamp Flexibility and Commodity Distribution 
        Consolidation Act of 1995

    To provide flexibility to States in the administration of 
the Food Stamp Program, consolidation of the commodity 
distribution programs, and for other purposes.
    On July 11, 1995, the Subcommittee on Department 
Operations, Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture considered and 
reported H.R. 1997 to the full Committee. Many of the 
provisions of H.R. 1997 were incorporated into the Conference 
Report to H.R. 4. (Note: For discussion of the Conference 
Report to H.R. 4, see part II, C ``3. Vetoed Bills'' supra.)
    The following, inter alia, are provisions from H.R. 1997 
that were incorporated into the Conference Report to H.R. 4:
          Greater state flexibility in administering the Food 
        Stamp Program, including establishing certification 
        periods, collecting overissuances, and operating state 
        food stamp offices;
          Authorization to use food stamp appropriated funds to 
        carrying out a Food Stamp Program in American Samoa; 
        and
          Authorization to use food stamp appropriated funds to 
        make grants to community food projects in order to 
        promote community self-reliance and nutrition issues.
    In addition to those provisions incorporated into the 
Conference Report to H.R. 4, H.R. 1997 made other reforms to 
the Food Stamp Program. H.R. 1997 also incorporated the 
substantive provisions of H.R. 236, which permitted food stamp 
recipients to purchase vitamins and minerals with food stamp 
benefits.

H.R. 2023, to provide for a land exchange between the Ironton Country 
        Club of Ironton, Ohio, and the Secretary of Agriculture 
        involving Wayne National Forest

    The Subcommittee on Resource Conservation, Research, and 
Forestry reported H.R. 2023, amended, to the full Committee on 
May 30, 1996. The legislation authorized the Forest to exchange 
141 acres of land with 134 acres owned by the Ironton Country 
Club. Any difference in apprised value of the tracts would be 
made up in cash by the Ironton Country Club.

H.R. 2202, Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995

    To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide a 
less bureaucratic alternative for the admission of temporary 
agricultural workers while safeguarding the interests of United 
States workers.
    On August 4, 1995, Mr. Smith of Texas introduced H.R. 2202 
to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to improve 
deterrence of illegal immigration to the United States by 
increasing border patrol and investigative personnel, by 
increasing penalties for alien smuggling and for document 
fraud, by reforming exclusion and deportation law and 
procedures, by improving the verification system for 
eligibility for employment, and through other measures, and to 
reform the legal immigration system and facilitate legal 
entries into the United States. H.R. 2202 was referred to the 
Committee on Judiciary, and in addition to the Committees on 
Agriculture, National Security, Government Reform and 
Oversight, Ways and Means, and Banking and Financial Services 
for consideration of such provisions as fall within the 
jurisdiction of the committee concerned.
    On March 5, 1996, the Committee considered and reported 
H.R. 2202 favorably to the House with an amendment adding 
subtitle B to title VIII. The Rules Committee ordered reported 
a resolution, H.Res. 384, for the consideration of H.R. 2202 as 
it would be considered by the House, but it did not include the 
amendment adopted by the Committee on Agriculture. Under H.Res. 
384, the amendment to H.R. 2202 adopted by the Committee on 
Agriculture was offered by Messrs. Pombo and Chambliss as an 
amendment to H.R. 2202 during consideration of H.R. 2202 by the 
House. The amendment failed by a vote of 180 to 242.
    The amendment approved by the Committee on Agriculture 
reformed the temporary immigrant worker law by creating a 
three-year pilot project in an effort to address concerns of 
both workers and employers. The amendment would streamline the 
Immigration and Nationality Act by reducing regulation and 
ensuring protection for workers. Under the amendment, employers 
would apply for immigrant work permits through the Department 
of Labor, which would process requests within seven days, 
rather than the present 60 days. Participating employers would 
also file a job order with their state job offices and would 
give preference to U.S. workers for the first 25 days. Domestic 
and immigrant laborers would receive Workers' Compensation 
coverage and be paid the prevailing wage in their area. In 
addition, guest workers could only work on a temporary basis 
and could never fill positions resulting from a labor dispute. 
The pilot program would limit the number of participants in the 
worker program.
    In order to ensure compliance, the Department of Labor 
would investigate complaints from workers and third parties and 
impose monetary penalties and program debarment for violators. 
The program would generate no additional costs, as user-based 
fees would pay for all costs to administer the program.

H.R. 2493, Food for Peace Reauthorization Act of 1995

    To make modifications to international food aid programs.
    On October 19, 1995, the Subcommittee on Department 
Operations, Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture considered and 
reported H.R. 2493 to the full Committee. H.R. 2493 
reauthorized and reformed the Food For Peace Program and Food 
For Progress Program. The provisions of H.R. 2493 were 
incorporated into subtitle A of title II of H.R. 2854, which 
was enacted as subtitle A of title II of Public Law 104-127. 
(Note: For a discussion of Public Law 104-127, see part II C 
``1. Bills Enacted into Law'' supra.)
    Under H.R. 2493, the Department of Agriculture may make 
sales to private entities in addition to foreign governments in 
keeping with a private sector emphasis.
    A priority for P.L. 480 funds in developing countries was 
created to reflect the new emphasis on market development 
goals.
    Funds to pay for the administrative costs for private 
voluntary organizations, cooperatives, and intergovernmental 
organizations that coordinate and distribute donations of U.S. 
agricultural commodities were increased to $28 million.
    Eligible organizations were allowed to carry out non-
emergency programs in countries where the Agency for 
International Development does not have a presence.
    Minimum tonnage levels for agricultural commodities were 
maintained at the 1995 level.
    The current wheat reserve was modified to include corn, 
sorghum and rice in addition to wheat. The reserve is used to 
meet extraordinary humanitarian need.

H.R. 2542, Conservation Consolidation and Regulatory Reform Act of 1995

    The Subcommittee on Resource Conservation, Research and 
Forestry reported H.R. 2542, the Conservation Consolidation and 
Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 to the full Committee on November 
8, 1995. The bill contained six titles and was an omnibus 
conservation bill amending several laws, including the Food 
Security Act of 1985.
    The bill would have reestablished the Soil Conservation 
Service and would have consolidated many different USDA 
conservation programs into a single program providing technical 
and financial assistance to farmers and ranchers as well as 
establishing a new water quality program. The legislation 
amended the highly-erodible land conservation program as well 
as repealing several provisions contained in the Food, 
Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990.

                              D. OVERSIGHT

                        1. LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

    The Committee on Agriculture and its subcommittees were 
active in their oversight functions, holding a number of 
oversight hearings both in the field and in Washington, D.C., 
during the course of the 104th Congress. The hearings related 
to the application, administration, and effectiveness of laws 
that lie within the Committee's jurisdiction as well as the 
organization and operation of the Department of Agriculture and 
other Federal agencies having responsibility for the 
administration of such laws. The hearings often resulted in 
recommendations for improvements in the administration of the 
laws, regulations and policies in effect in the Executive 
Branch as they related to the Committee's jurisdiction. 
Information gathered at these hearings was later useful in 
preparing legislation for consideration in the House of 
Representatives or in making recommendations to departmental or 
Federal agency representatives.
    As part of its hearings on virtually every bill, the 
Committee and its subcommittees reviewed the way the particular 
Federal agency or department (usually the Department of 
Agriculture) administered existing laws related to the subject 
matter of the legislation before, or to be considered by, the 
Committee. In some cases, legislation favorably reported to the 
House carries a termination date (a ``sunset'') to ensure that 
in the future Congress will again review the effectiveness and 
the methods with which the Executive Branch of Government has 
carried out the letter and the spirit of that statute.
    The Committee and its subcommittees in keeping with the 
objective of the Oversight Plan as submitted to the Committee 
on Government Reform and Oversight (See ``I. Summary of 
Organization, Jurisdiction, and Oversight Plan of the Committee 
on Agriculture'' of this report for the complete Oversight Plan 
as submitted) conducted the following Oversight hearings during 
the 104th Congress which are listed chronological:

Oversight hearings, 104th Congress--chronological listing

    February 1, 1995: To review the enforcement of the Food 
Stamp Program.
    The full Committee began its work in the 104th Congress 
with a hearing regarding reports and claims of waste and fraud 
in the Food Stamp Program. Testimony about enforcement problems 
in the program included testimony from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Inspector General, officials from the U.S. Secret 
Service and officials from the General Accounting Office, all 
of whom assist in the examination of the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the management of the program.
    This hearing and other hearings by the Subcommittee on 
Department Operations, Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture 
resulted in the introduction of H.R. 1135, the Food Stamp 
Reform and Commodity Distribution Act that was later 
incorporated into H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act, 
which was ultimately vetoed by the President. However, a 
substantial number of the provisions of H.R. 1135 were later 
also incorporated into H.R. 3734 which became Public Law 104-
193.
    (Note.--For further discussion of the provisions of the 
these bills see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of 
the Committee on Which Some Action Has Been Taken''.)
    February 7, 8, 9, and 14, 1995: To review the present 
welfare system. Subcommittee on Department Operations, 
Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture.
    The Subcommittee on Department Operations, Nutrition, and 
Foreign Agriculture has the principal responsibility with 
respect to the oversight of the food stamp and several other 
nutrition programs. These hearings were instrumental in helping 
the subcommittee to develop ``welfare reform'' proposals that 
seek to lead those who receive program benefits away from long-
term dependence on Federal welfare programs in order to better 
help such individuals reclaim their independence.
    Testimony was received from Administration Officials, 
Governors, Members of Congress, Food Banks, etc. These hearings 
and other hearings conducted by the Full Committee resulted, as 
noted earlier, in the introduction of H.R. 1135, the Food Stamp 
Reform and Commodity Distribution Act that was later 
incorporated into H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act, 
which was ultimately vetoed by the President. However, several 
provisions of H.R. 1135 were later incorporated into H.R. 3734 
which became Public Law 104-193. (Note: For discussion of the 
provisions of the these bills see ``C. Digest of Bills Within 
the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Which Some Action Has Been 
Taken''.)
    February 10, 1995: To review the timber salvage situation 
on public lands affected by insects, disease, and fire. 
Subcommittee on Resource Conservation, Research, and Forestry.
    This Subcommittee hearing was jointly held with the 
Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Land of the 
Committee on Resources, chaired by Congressman James Hansen 
from Utah.
    The Subcommittee received testimony and written statements 
for the record from 26 witnesses, representing a wide range of 
constituencies, as well as Members of Congress, and including 
forest product manufacturers, conservation groups, forest 
product employees, Federal regulatory agencies, forest 
researchers, university researchers, and private citizens. The 
testimony heard by the Subcommittee centered around the causes 
and effects of various Federal laws with respect to forest 
health, local economic conditions, timber employment, and 
endangered species. Particular attention was focused on last 
year's (1994) situation, in which roughly 78,000 wildfires 
burned 1.3 million acres of State and private lands, 1.5 
million acres of National Forest System land, and 1.3 million 
acres of Department of Interior lands.
    February 15, 1995: To consider the private property rights, 
protection and relevant legislation pending before the 104th 
Congress. Subcommittee on Resource Conservation, Research, and 
Forestry.
    The Subcommittee heard testimony from 16 witnesses and 
received written testimony from 9 other individuals, (plus 
Members of Congress) representing Federal agencies, University 
professors, agricultural representatives, conservation groups, 
and private citizens. The purpose of this Subcommittee hearing 
was to consider private property rights in the context of 
regulatory actions taken by the Federal Government which have 
the effect of seriously impeding landowners and other private 
citizens' ability to make land use decisions.
    This hearing was instrumental to the action taken by the 
House of Representatives on H.R. 925, the Private Property 
Protection Act of 1995 and H.R. 9, the Job Creation and Wage 
Enhancement Act of 1995. (Note.--For discussion of these bills, 
see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Which Some Action Has Been Taken''.)
    February 23, 1995: To consider how the Federal Tax Code

keep family farm and ranch operations in the family. 
Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities.
    The Subcommittee heard testimony from 12 people (plus 
Members of Congress) representing agricultural groups, banking 
groups, and university researchers and it received written 
testimony from 3 additional people, representing agricultural 
producer groups. The Subcommittee heard testimony concerning 
the impact of several elements of the Federal Tax Code 
(including capital gains, health care insurance deductibility, 
and estate and gift taxes) on net farm income, small 
businesses, and local economic conditions in rural communities.
    March 16, 1995: To review the Perishable Agricultural 
Commodities Act. Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty 
Crops.
    The Subcommittee met to consider legislation dealing with 
the reauthorization of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities 
Act (``PACA''), specifically H.R. 1103, introduced by 
Congressman Pombo from California.
    The Subcommittee heard testimony from 15 witnesses, and 
received written testimony from 5 people. The interest groups 
represented by the witnesses included State agriculture 
departments, USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, and a 
variety of food and agricultural groups. Testimony revolved 
around what changes to make in the current PACA that would 
improve its operations and make PACA more efficient, and how to 
ensure that the fees necessary to fund PACA are administered 
most equitably and adequately to perform its duties.
    This hearing resulted in the enactment of Public Law 104-
48. (Note.--For further discussion of Public Law 104-48, see 
``C. Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Which Some Action Has Been Taken''.)
    March 23; April 18, 19, 20, 24, and 26, 1995: To consider 
the state of the American dairy industry and the status of the 
dairy title of the 1990 farm bill, as the committee reviews the 
formulation of the 1995 farm bill. Subcommittee on Livestock, 
Dairy, and Poultry.
    The Subcommittee held a series of hearings in Washington, 
DC, Eau Claire, WI, St. Paul, MN, Tulare, CA, Syracuse, NY, and 
Okeechobee, FL to receive testimony from dairy farmers, farm 
groups, dairy manufacturers, dairy policy analysts, USDA 
officials, State dairy officials, and other interested parties 
regarding dairy policy changes with respect to Federal dairy 
laws. Testimony was received regarding the dairy price support 
program, Federal milk marketing orders, the Dairy Export 
Incentive Program (DEIP), and dairy export opportunities.
    These hearings ultimately contributed to the enactment of 
Public Law 104-127, which was enacted into law on April 4, 
1996.
    (Note.--For a discussion of Public Law 104-127, see ``C. 
Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on 
Which Some Action Has Been Taken''.)
    March 28, 1995: To review the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 
1994. Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops.
    The Subcommittee received testimony from 15 witnesses, 
representing USDA's Farm Service Agency and Federal Crop 
Insurance Corporation, agricultural groups, insurance groups, 
and grower associations, regarding issues concerning USDA's 
implementation of the changes to the crop insurance program as 
contained in Pub. L. 103-354 (the Federal Crop Insurance Reform 
and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994). 
Testimony was also received regarding suggested changes to the 
non-insured disaster assistance program and to the crop revenue 
insurance pilot program. Several changes to existing law 
regarding crop insurance were subsequently made and eventually 
incorporated into the Federal Agriculture Improvement and 
Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127). (Note.--For 
discussion of Public Law 104-127, see ``C. Digest of Bills 
Within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Which Some Action 
Has Been Taken''.)

provisions and their impact on program commodity crops. 
Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities.
    The Subcommittee received testimony from 10 witnesses 
representing USDA, producer groups, commodity groups, and farm 
policy analysts. The purpose of the Subcommittee hearing was to 
gather information regarding the economic and budgetary impacts 
of the Federal Government's continued use of acreage reduction 
programs as a method for (1) distributing farm program 
payments; and (2) controlling Federal budgetary outlays. The 
subject matter of this hearing, acreage reduction programs, was 
reflected in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act 
of 1996 (Public Law 104-127) which was enacted into law on 
April 4, 1996. (Note.--For discussion of Public Law 104-127, 
see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of the

discussion regarding potential changes to the ``Swampbuster'' 
provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 (Title XII), some 
of which were contained in legislation introduced by 
Congressman Johnson, H.R. 932.
    The subject matter of this hearing, wetlands regulation by 
USDA, was reflected in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and 
Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127) which was enacted into 
law on April 4, 1996. (Note.--For discussion of Public Law 104-
127, see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of the

American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA'') on United States 
agriculture.
    The subject matter discussed during these hearings was 
eventually reflected in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and 
Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127) which was enacted into 
law on April 4, 1996. (Note.--For discussion of Public Law 104-
127, see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Which Some Action Has Been Taken''.)
    May 16, 18, 23, and 25, 1995: To review technical 
considerations in the formulation of the dairy title of the 
1995 farm bill. Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry.
    The Subcommittee held a series of hearings in Washington, 
DC, to receive additional testimony from dairy farmers, farm 
groups, dairy manufacturers, dairy policy analysts, USDA 
officials, State dairy officials, and other interested parties 
regarding technical dairy policy implications of the dairy 
title of the farm bill. The majority of the testimony received 
involved recommendations for redesigning the pricing system for 
milk (including the Basic Formula Price), and for the dairy 
export and promotion programs (including world trade 
opportunities and the appropriate role of the Federal 
Government in dairy promotion). The legislation regarding dairy 
policy discussed during these hearings was eventually reflected 
in one way or another into the Federal Agriculture Improvement 
and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127) which was enacted 
into law on April 4, 1996. (Note.--For discussion of Public Law 
104-127, see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of 
the Committee on Which Some Action Has Been Taken''.)
    June 8, 1995: To review the proposals included in the 
``Guidance of the Administration'', to Reform the Food Stamp 
and Commodity Distribution Programs. Subcommittee on Department 
Operations, Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture.
    The Subcommittee received testimony from five witnesses, 
representing USDA's Food and Consumer Services, and several 
food distribution organizations. The purpose of the hearing was 
to review USDA's proposals regarding changes to USDA's food 
stamp and commodity distribution programs.
    The subject matter of this hearing, changes to the food 
stamp and commodity distribution programs, impacted the welfare 
reform provisions of H.R. 3734 which was enacted into Public 
Law 104-193 on August 22, 1996. (Note.--For discussion of 
Public Law 104-193, see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the 
Jurisdiction of the Committee on Which Some Action Has Been 
Taken''.)
    June 21, 1995: To review Public Law 480, the Food for Peace 
Program. Subcommittee on Department Operations, Nutrition, and 
Foreign Agriculture.
    The Subcommittee heard testimony from seven witnesses and 
received additional written testimony from four individuals, 
representing the U.S. Agency for International Development, 
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, several world food relief 
and distribution organizations, and cooperative assistance 
associations. The purpose of the hearing was to review P.L. 
480, the ``Food for Peace'' program, and to receive the 
opinions and recommendations of those organizations most 
familiar with its administration.
    The subject matter of this hearing, P.L. 480, was 
reauthorized by the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform 
Act of 1996 (Public Law 127) which was enacted into law on 
April 4, 1996. (Note.--For discussion of Public Law 104-193, 
see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the Jurisdiction of the 
Committee on Which Some Action Has Been Taken''.)
    October 20, 1995: To consider the importance of the Asia-
Pacific region to the U.S. Agricultural Trade. Subcommittee on

receive testimony from interested persons regarding the 
importance of trade with the Asia-Pacific Rim Region to U.S. 
agriculture. The Subcommittee heard testimony from seven 
witnesses, representing USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service, 
commodity groups, agribusinesses, and university trade 
analysts. Testimony was received regarding the economic 
benefits derived by the U.S. agriculture sector from trade with 
the Asia-Pacific Rim, opportunities facing the U.S. agriculture 
sector in the future, and the need to continue to strive for 
reductions in trade barriers to U.S. agricultural products in 
this region.
    October 25, 1995: To consider the rural development reforms 
in the Agriculture Regulatory Relief and Trade Act of 1995. 
Subcommittee on Resource Conservation, Research, and Forestry.
    The Subcommittee heard testimony from eight witnesses, 
representing USDA's Rural Economic and Community Development 
organizations, a variety of rural development organizations, as 
well as several state and local economic development 
associations. The purpose of this hearing was to gather 
information about the interests and suggestions of all 
witnesses with respect to potential changes to the farm credit/
rural development programs in the upcoming farm bill.
    The subject matter of this hearing, rural development 
programs, was substantially reflected in the Federal 
Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-
127) which was enacted into law on April 4, 1996. (Note.--For 
discussion of Public Law 104-127, see ``C. Digest of Bills 
Within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Which Some Action 
Has Been Taken''.)
    December 6, 1995: To review the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Office of Risk Assessment and Cost-Benefit 
Analysis. Subcommittee on Department Operations, Nutrition, and 
Foreign Agriculture.
    The Subcommittee received testimony from USDA's Chief 
Economist and Director of Office of Risk Assessment and Cost-
Benefit Analysis. The purpose of the hearing was to gather 
information regarding the effectiveness of USDA's Office of 
Risk Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis in making USDA's 
regulatory process more effective and efficient and less 
burdensome on those regulated. This Office was created as part 
of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of 
Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-354.
    December 14, 1995: To review Agricultural Guest Worker 
Programs. Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops, 
Committee on Agriculture, jointly with the Subcommittee on 
Immigration and Claims, Committee on the Judiciary.
    The Subcommittee heard testimony from 12 witnesses 
representing farm organizations, farmworker organizations, and 
university researchers, as well as statements from several 
interested Members of Congress, regarding seasonal guestworkers 
under the so-called H2-A Program administered by the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice. 
Testimony was received regarding the benefits to United States 
agriculture from this program, current problems with the 
program's administration, and issues for future consideration 
as they might impact U.S. agriculture.
    The subject matter of this hearing was added as a Committee 
on Agriculture amendment to H.R. 2202, the Immigration in the 
National Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995, as 
reported by the Committee on Agriculture (H. Rept. 104-469 pt. 
3 and pt. 4). However, in the House consideration of H.R. 2202 
in the House of Representatives on March 21, 1996, in the 
Committee of the Whole House, the H2-A Program was not adopted. 
(Note.--For discussion of H.R. 2202, see ``C. Digest of Bills 
Within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Which Some Action 
Has Been Taken''.)
    March 1, 1996: To review the effectiveness of the Federal 
Crop Insurance Program for the damage done by Hurricane Opal. 
Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops.
    The Subcommittee held a hearing in Headland, AL, to receive 
testimony from insurance agents, producer groups, state 
agriculture officials, and farmers regarding the effectiveness 
of Federal Crop Insurance Corporation programs in covering crop 
damage done by Hurricane Opal. Testimony was received 
concerning the particular damage done to local producers during 
the 1995 crop year, as well as several comments and criticisms 
regarding USDA's implementation of catastrophic crop insurance 
protection.
    March 27, May 14, and July 17, 1996: To evaluate the goal, 
priority setting, and advisory mechanism of Federal programs in 
agricultural research, education, and extension. Subcommittee 
on Resource Conservation, Research, and Forestry.
    The Subcommittee held 3 hearings in Washington, DC, and 
received testimony from over 30 witnesses regarding the 
evaluation of Federal programs in agricultural research, 
education, and extension. The Subcommittee heard testimony from 
over 30 witnesses, representing USDA and a wide variety of 
research, education, and extension specialists and analysts. 
The purpose of this hearing was to gather information about the 
interests and suggestions of all witnesses with respect to how 
to use available Federal research dollars most effectively and 
efficiently while addressing possible future decline in Federal 
funding.
    Most research, education, and extension programs were 
reauthorized for two years by the Federal Agriculture 
Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-127) which 
was enacted into law on April 4, 1996. (Note.--For discussion 
of Public Law 104-127, see ``C. Digest of Bills Within the 
Jurisdiction of the Committee on Which Some Action Has Been 
Taken''.)
    Because most programs will expire at the end of two years, 
the information gathered by Subcommittee in these hearings will 
be important in crafting future legislation (presumably the 
105th Congress) for Federal agricultural research, education, 
and extension programs.
    April 24; May 2, 22; and June 6, 1996: To consider meat and 
poultry inspection systems of foreign countries and to compare 
them to the Federal and State inspection systems in the United 
States. Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry.
    The Subcommittee held a series of 4 hearings in Washington, 
DC, to receive testimony relating to the issue of meat, 
poultry, and seafood inspection in the United States.
    The purpose of the first hearing was to examine meat and 
poultry inspection systems of foreign countries and to compare 
them to the Federal and State inspection systems in the United 
States. During the first hearing, testimony was received from 
New Zealand, the European Commission, Australia, and Canada 
regarding meat inspection practices and regulations in those 
countries.
    The purpose of the second hearing was to examine the 
utility, efficacy, and regulatory status of implementing 
microbial intervention technologies with respect to processing 
meat and poultry products. During the second hearing, testimony 
was received from various university researchers, 
agribusinesses, and USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service 
regarding food service industry inspection technologies either 
currently employed or being studied for possible adoption.
    The purpose of the third hearing was to examine the basic 
elements of existing seafood inspection programs. During the 
third hearing, testimony was received from that National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Food and Drug 
Administration regarding seafood inspection.
    The purpose of the fourth hearing was to examine the issue 
of the existing Federal prohibition on the interstate shipment 
of state-inspected meat and poultry products. During the fourth 
hearing, testimony was received from State departments of 
agriculture, private meat processing companies, and USDA's Food 
Safety and Inspection Service.
    May 15 and 16, 1996: To Review the trading practices and 
procedures of the National Cheese Exchange. Subcommittee on 
Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry, jointly with the Subcommittee on 
Risk Management and Specialty Crops.
    In keeping with the Committee's oversight plan to review 
commodity marketing systems and market prices where anomalies 
are detected, the Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry 
and the Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops 
held joint oversight hearings regarding allegations of 
potential price manipulation on the National Cheese Exchange in 
Green Bay. Changes in the price of cheddar cheese on the 
Exchange are used by USDA as the primary mover of the monthly 
Basic Formula Price for milk. These oversight hearings resulted 
in proposals by USDA to use a significantly broader sample of 
prices paid for milk used to manufacture cheddar cheese when 
calculating the Basic Formula Price.
    May 18, 1996: To review agricultural trade between the 
United States and Canada. Subcommittee on General Farm 
Commodities.
    The Subcommittee held a hearing in Coeur d'Alene, ID, to 
receive testimony regarding agricultural trade between the U.S. 
and Canada. The Subcommittee heard testimony from several 
United States commodity groups, Idaho commodity groups, grain 
export groups, timber groups, and USDA's Foreign Agricultural 
Service. The Subcommittee heard testimony describing both the 
negative and positive effects of trade with Canada on the State 
and local economies, as well as suggestions for further 
reductions in trade restraints in order to provide continued 
benefits and opportunities for United States agricultural 
commodity and silviculture products.
    June 5, 1996: To consider trade opportunities in the 
Pacific Rim. Full Committee.
    The purpose of the hearing was to receive testimony 
regarding trade opportunities in the Pacific Rim, with special 
emphasis on trade issues with China with regard to the 
continuation of MFN status under the Jackson-Vanik amendment to 
the 1974 Trade Act. The Committee heard testimony from 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, the U.S. Trade 
Representative, and several international trade policy 
organizations. The Committee heard testimony regarding the 
benefits of open trade, as well as several particular issues 
regarding activities by foreign countries that were harming 
various sectors of U.S. agriculture.
    July 24, 1996: To review the status of the Hedge-To-Arrive 
Contracts. Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops.
    The purpose of this Subcommittee hearing was to gather 
information regarding the status of various hedge-to-arrive 
commodity exchanges, and country elevators contracts, 
specifically to find out how the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission may plan to deal with several situations across the 
country that involve hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of 
hedge-to-arrive grain contracts that are threatening to 
adversely affect farmers and country elevators and their credit 
providers. The Subcommittee received testimony from the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Ohio State Department 
of Agriculture, the Chicago Board of Trade, and several grain 
marketing organizations.
    July 25, 1996: To conduct oversight on the processor-funded

Processor Promotion Board, the International Dairy Food 
Association, and the New York State Dairy Foods Association.
    July 30, 1996: To review the National Soybean Promotion 
Program. Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities.
    The purpose of the hearing was to receive testimony 
regarding the National Soybean Promotion Program; to hear from 
soybean producers who were opposed to the mandatory nature of 
the referendum voting procedure, and especially the procedure 
for obtaining a new referendum for certain producers 
dissatisfied with current procedures. The Subcommittee heard 
testimony from USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, the 
American Soybean Association, the Iowa Soybean Promotion Board, 
the United Soybean Board, and several soybean producers.
    September 12, 1996: To consider the competitiveness in 
agriculture trade and the effect of State Trading Enterprises 
on our U.S. exports. Full Committee.
    The purpose of this hearing was to examine competitiveness 
issues relating to U.S. agricultural trade and the effect of 
State Trading Enterprises on U.S. exports. Testimony relating 
to trade opportunities, continued barriers to U.S. exports, and

commodity groups, export associations, and trade coalitions. 
Witnesses provided the Committee with a broad variety of 
information regarding trade barriers, trade opportunities, and 
particular effects of trade policy on domestic agriculture 
sectors.
    September 19, 1996: To review the Conservation Reserve 
Program and the Implementation of the Conservation Title of the 
Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (``FAIR'') Act of 
1996. Full Committee.
    The Committee held an oversight hearing to examine the 
implementation issues regarding USDA's administration of the 
conservation title of the FAIR Act; specifically, to question 
USDA witnesses about implementation of the Conservation Reserve 
Program. Testimony from USDA's Deputy Secretary Romminger was 
received regarding USDA's intentions for implementation of the 
Conservation Reserve Program, the Wetlands Reserve Program, and 
other changes to the Sodbuster and Swampbuster (title XII) 
provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985. Members of the 
Committee questioned several USDA officials regarding specific 
regulatory items relating to the Conservation Reserve Program 
and highly erodible land issues, and wetlands delineations.
    September 24, 1996: To review the status of the Florida 
tomato industry. Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty 
Crops.
    The purpose of the Subcommittee hearing was to examine the 
issues surrounding Florida-Mexican tomato trade, including the 
increase of winter vegetable imports from Mexico. Testimony was 
received from U.S. growers, local government officials, and 
others involved with the winter vegetable industry regarding 
the negative effects of increased Mexican winter vegetable 
imports on Florida's $6.2 billion agriculture industry.
    September 25, 1996: To consider the current status of 
exports of U.S. dairy, poultry, and egg products into Canada, 
and the potential impact of the preliminary decision of the 
NAFTA panel on that trade. Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, 
and Poultry.
    Despite the movement toward free trade evidenced by NAFTA 
and the Uruguay Round of the GATT, Canada refuses to open its 
markets to U.S. dairy, poultry, and egg produce.
    The dispute over Canadian tariffs on U.S. dairy, poultry 
and egg products is currently before a five-member NAFTA 
disputes resolution panel which is expected to render a

                       2. investigative oversight

    The Committee and the Subcommittee on Department 
Operations, Nutrition and Foreign Agriculture were also active 
in investigative oversight activities. Congressional 
investigations, often adversarial and confrontational, sustain 
Congress's role which maintain the integrity of our 
constitutional scheme of separated powers and permit the 
Congress to oversee the implementation and regulation of its 
legislative initiative enacted into law.

Investigative hearings, 104th Congress--chronological listing

    May 8, 1996: To investigate the use of Food Stamp Program 
funds to obtain services from private contractors. Full 
Committee.
    September 18, 1996: To investigate the contracting 
practices and other activities of the Department of Agriculture 
relating Team Nutrition. Subcommittee on Department Operations, 
Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture.
    The former Chairman of the Department Operations, 
Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee, Bill Emerson, 
wrote the Secretary of Agriculture on July 25, 1995, and raised 
several serious issues related to Team Nutrition, a project 
initiated by the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and 
Consumer Services. In October 1995, a review by the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) of Team Nutrition contracting practices 
and other matters was requested by Chairman Pat Roberts and the 
Chairman of the Department Operations, Nutrition, and Foreign 
Agriculture Subcommittee, Bill Emerson.
    The GAO investigation, its conclusions, and the Committee 
and Subcommittee hearings are comprised of three parts: the May 
8, 1996, Committee hearing to investigate the use of food stamp 
program funds to obtain services from private contractors; the 
August 8, 1996, report submitted to Chairman Roberts from GAO 
regarding the employment of Team Nutrition officials and the 
travel of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer 
Services; and the September 18, 1996, Subcommittee hearing to 
investigate the contracting practices and other activities of 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture relating to Team Nutrition.
            May 8, 1996, Committee investigative hearing
    On May 8, 1996, the Committee held a hearing to review the 
use of Food Stamp Program funds to obtain services from private 
contractors. Testimony was received from representatives of 
GAO, the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer 
Services, and Celinda Lake. All testimony was received under 
oath.
    During the course of its investigation of the USDA Team 
Nutrition project and contracts, GAO found a subcontract that 
was unrelated to the overall prime Team Nutrition contract. 
That subcontract was with Lake Research, a polling firm run by 
Celinda Lake who frequently polls for Democrat candidates. Over 
a dinner meeting (February 16, 1995) with Ellen Haas, the Under 
Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, Celinda 
Lake was effectively hired to run four focus groups in Topeka, 
Kansas and Indianapolis, Indiana, the home states of the 
Chairmen of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. USDA 
paid $33,000 from money appropriated for the Food Stamp Program 
to gather the opinions from people who are registered to vote, 
voted in the last Presidential election, are between the ages 
of 30 and 65 and are white. The opinions of these ``swing 
voters'' were sought on food stamp program reforms and changing 
the name of the food stamp program.
    GAO found that USDA failed to comply with the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and the 
simplified procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition 
Regulations which require federal agencies to solicit price 
quotations from at least three sources.
    GAO also found that USDA failed to comply with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act. That Act requires federal agencies 
planning to collect information from the public must publish a 
notice in the Federal Register and get review and approval from 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). GAO found that the 
failure to do so deprived federal officials of the opportunity 
to independently review the need for and the propriety of these 
focus groups.
    GAO determined that the methods used by USDA to conduct 
these focus groups were inconsistent with achieving the results 
set forth in its own contract.
    GAO determined USDA exercised questionable judgment in 
conducting virtually every aspect of this work.
    Chairman Roberts, in a statement to the Under Secretary at 
the hearing, cited the fear of reprisals expressed by USDA 
employees as a serious problem. He advised the Under Secretary 
that the Committee would be watching closely to insure that no 
reprisals are taken against career employees of the Food and 
Consumer Service as a result of this investigation.
    The Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer 
Services testified that by hiring Lake Research to conduct 
focus groups, the intention of USDA was to assist in their 
preparation of USDA's proposals to reform the food stamp 
program. The Under Secretary acknowledged the problems with the 
way the research was conducted and the way it was managed. The 
Under Secretary apologized and advised the Committee of steps 
taken to prevent this from occurring in the future.
    Celinda Lake testified that Lake Research was hired to 
conduct focus groups to test responses to food assistance 
reforms and general attitudes toward the Food Stamp Program. 
Ms. Lake maintained that the work of Lake Research was 
conducted on the same basis and terms as would be done for 
other clients.
            August 8, 1996, GAO Report on Team Nutrition Hiring and 
                    Travel
    On August 8, 1996, GAO submitted a report on several issues 
related to the employment of certain Team Nutrition officials 
and the travel of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and 
Consumer Services. This investigation and the report were 
prepared at the request of the Chairman of the Committee and 
the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Department Operations, 
Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture.
    Through the intervention of the Under Secretary for Food, 
Nutrition, and Consumer Services, a person previously known to 
the Under Secretary, was hired on April 24, 1995, on an 
expedited basis as the Team Nutrition Project Manager. Proper 
personnel rules were ignored in order to accommodate the quick 
hiring of this person. The Project Manager was allowed to work 
four days per week (10 hours/day), a highly unusual event for 
senior managers. The Project Manager's job application was 
incomplete, internally inconsistent, and contained false 
statements regarding her academic credentials. Her initial 
salary was based on her written statement alone and then 
increased after only 60 days on the job.
    When asked for an explanation of her prior salary (after 
the initiation of the GAO review), the Project Manager claimed 
the value of pro bono work at the White House (1993-1994) and 
from other questionable sources.
    The GAO found that because only a perfunctory review was 
made of the Project manager's paperwork related to her 
employment history and prior salary, USDA was not aware of the 
potential problems with the credentials. GAO also found that 
USDA did not have an adequate basis for establishing the former 
Project Manager's salary and that the former Project Manager 
failed to submit the required financial disclosure statement 
within 30 days of employment. The former Project Manager did 
not submit the required statement until a year after it was 
due.
    The GAO referred this matter (academic credentials and 
prior salary) to the USDA Office of the Inspector General on 
July 3, 1996, for further investigation. The Inspector General, 
in turn, referred this matter to the U.S. Attorney for the 
Eastern District of Virginia, which accepted it for 
investigation on July 12, 1996.
            September 18, 1996, Subcommittee Hearing
    The September 18, 1996, Subcommittee hearing was called to 
receive testimony pertaining to the contracting practices and 
other activities of the USDA relating to Team Nutrition. 
Testimony was received from representatives from GAO and the 
Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. All 
testimony was received under oath.
    The GAO testified that Team Nutrition contracts, 
cooperative agreements, grants, and personnel management 
practices exhibited a pattern of poor management and, in some 
cases, violations of federal procurement law and ethics 
regulations. These obligations, made on behalf of the federal 
government, reflect poor management and questionable judgement. 
Private contractors started work without the knowledge of the 
prime contractor or the USDA contracting officials. People were 
hired and there was no record of work that was done until long 
after payment was made.
    Several subcontractors had ties to the Democratic Party.
    Poor management and questionable judgment were evidenced on 
all contracts, subcontracts, grants and agreements.
    Normal contracting procedures were not followed.
    The Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer 
Services was involved in a significant number of the contracts, 
grants, and agreements.
    Additional costs were incurred due to mismanagement.
    Work was done by subcontractors before contracts were 
signed.
    In some contracts and grants, work was not completed, 
documented, or was in dispute.
    Some of the subcontracts were outside the scope of the 
contract.
    The USDA contracting office was unaware of some contracts 
before work was begun.
    Federal ethics regulations were violated by the Under 
Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services.
    The GAO investigation and testimony at the September 18, 
1996, hearing revealed significant problems related to the 
management of Team Nutrition.
    The Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer 
Services testified that she recognized the importance of the 
procurement and contracting issues rased by GAO and described 
the corrective actions taken by USDA. The Under Secretary 
maintained that she committed no violations of federal ethics 
regulations and that through her confidential assistant she 
recused herself regarding the award of a grant to a personal 
friend.
    September 5, 12, and 24, 1996: To consider authorization in 
the issuance of subpoenas to witnesses for a subsequent hearing 
on alleged violations of the Hatch Act and related laws by USDA 
employees. Subcommittee on Department Operations, Nutrition, 
and Foreign Agriculture.
    In late 1994, the Los Angeles Times and other news media 
reported that in the fall of 1992, several employees in the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) solicited 
political contributions from other career Civil Service 
employees at USDA and that those who solicited or contributed 
were subsequently promoted to more senior or powerful 
positions. Because of the serious nature of these allegations, 
and the need to assure that the USDA and its programs are 
administered without regard to political party affiliation or 
patronage in contravention of the provisions of the Hatch Act 
and related laws, the Committee initiated its own investigation 
in 1995 and obtained the detail of a General Accounting Office 
(GAO) attorney/investigator to the Committee payroll to assist. 
The Committee personnel interviewed numerous current and former 
USDA employees, uncovered documents, and obtained affidavits 
and unsworn declarations made under penalty of perjury. This 
evidence disclosed violations of civil and criminal 
prohibitions as well as some denials of such violations among 
employees at USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation 
Service, the predecessor organization to USDA's Farm Service 
Agency.
    The information gathered by the Committee was provided to 
the Department of Justice, which began its own investigation 
based on earlier request from the Chairmen of the House 
Agriculture Committee and the House Government Reform and 
Oversight Committee to the Attorney General to appoint 
Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz to investigate the matter. 
However, Attorney General Janet Reno, denied that request and 
referred the matter to the Department of Justice, Public 
Integrity Section of the Criminal Division. The Chairman agreed 
to the Department of Justice's subsequent repeated requests to 
delay hearings on the matter to avoid jeopardizing a case the 
Department of Justice might bring as a result of its own 
investigation.
    In the summer of 1996, the investigation was turned over to 
the Subcommittee on Department Operations, Nutrition, and 
Foreign Agriculture. That Subcommittee met on September 5 and 
12 and authorized the Chairman to issue subpoenas for the 
attendance of witnesses.
    On September 24, the Subcommittee conducted an 
investigative hearing on this matter, taking testimony from the 
Committee's investigator, senior USDA officials, those involved 
in soliciting contributions, and individuals who were 
solicited. The Subcommittee also heard from representatives 
from the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) which enforces the 
Hatch Act and the Department of Justice.
    Eleven days before the hearing, based in large part on 
information uncovered by the Committee, on September 13, 1996, 
three former and one current USDA employee plead guilty to 
conspiring with each other to solicit political contributions 
from USDA and promising special employment benefits to those 
who contributed. On December 13, two of the former defendants 
were sentenced to 30 days of incarceration for their conduct. 
All of the defendants were also given two years probation and 
required to donate 100 hours or more in community service and 
fines were also imposed.
    The hearing helped depoliticize the USDA career Civil 
Service community, and should help assure civil servants 
throughout government that they need not tolerate pressure to 
make political donations to keep their jobs or advance their 
careers. The Committee also obtained a commitment from USDA to 
be place additional emphasis on compliance with the Hatch Act 
and related laws, and requested that the Office of Special 
Counsel conduct special outreach sessions with USDA to assure 
this conduct is not repeated there.
