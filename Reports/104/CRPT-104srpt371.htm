    On April 29, 1996, Senator Robert J. Dole introduced S. 
1711. As introduced, S. 1711 would have created a Commission to 
evaluate the programs of the Federal Government that assist 
members of the Armed Forces and veterans in readjusting to 
civilian life.
    On June 29, 1995, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator 
Alan K. Simpson, introduced several bills at the request of the 
Administration, including S. 994, which would have clarified 
the eligibility of certain minors for burial in national 
cemeteries; S. 995, which would have restricted the payment of 
clothing allowances to incarcerated veterans and created a 
legal presumption that certain veterans are permanently and 
totally disabled; and S. 996, which would have reformed the 
Servicemen's Group Life Insurance program and the Veterans' 
Group Life Insurance program.
    On May 13, 1996, Senator Simpson introduced several bills

August 5, 1964, to December 22, 1961.
    On May 3, 1995, Committee member Daniel K. Akaka, 
introduced S. 749 with the cosponsorship of the Ranking 
Minority Member of the Committee, Senator John D. Rockefeller

relating to the Center for Minority Veterans and the Center for 
Women Veterans of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
    On October 19, 1995, Senator Akaka introduced S. 1342 with 
the cosponsorship of Senator Rockefeller, Senator Daniel K. 
Inouye, Committee member Paul Wellstone, and Senator Paul 
Simon. As introduced, S. 1342 would have authorized the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make loans to refinance loans 
made to veterans under the Native American Veterans Direct Loan 
Program.
    On May 23, 1996, the Committee held a hearing to receive 
testimony on pending legislation, including S. 1711, as 
introduced, S. 994, S. 995, S. 996, S. 1751, S. 281, S. 749,

programs, job training programs, vocational rehabilitation 
programs (for disabled veterans), job placement assistance and 
counseling programs, home loan programs, small business 
assistance, and other assistance programs.

persons. Commission members would be appointed by the chairs, 
in consultation with the ranking minority members, of the 
Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs, the Senate 
Committee on Armed Services, and the House Committee on 
National Security. Two members of the Commission--one appointed 
by each of the chairs of the Committees on Veterans' Affairs--
would be representatives of veterans service organizations. No 
more than seven members of the Commission would be members of 
the same political party, and, to the extend practicable, all 
members of the Commission would be veterans.
            Section 102. Duties of the Commission
    Section 102 specifies that the Commission would review the 
adequacy, effectiveness and appropriateness of transition and 
assistance programs in place to assist members of the Armed 
Services in adjusting to civilian life upon separation. The 
Commission would examine, among other things, educational 
assistance programs; job counseling, job training, and job 
placement programs; rehabilitation and training programs; 
housing loan programs; small business loan and small business 
assistance programs; employer training and union apprenticeship 
programs; Federal Government personnel policies, including 
veterans' preference policies; and programs to assist the 
transition of military families. The Commission would review 
the allocation of responsibility for these various transition 
programs among the various Federal departments and agencies, 
and determine the feasibility and desirability of consolidating 
such programs in one department or agency. Upon the completion 
of its review, the Commission would make recommendations to 
Congress on ways to improve, and to ensure the continued 
utility of, these programs.
    The Commission would be required to submit a preliminary 
report, detailing the planned work of the Commission, within 90 
days of the appointment of its membership, and a final report, 
specifying the Commission's findings and recommendations for 
legislative and administrative action, within 1 year of the 
date of the first meeting of the Commission. The Departments of 
Defense and Veterans Affairs would be required to jointly 
transmit their comments on the Commission's final report to 
Congress.
            Section 103. Powers of the Commission
    The Commission would be authorized to hold hearings and 
receive testimony and evidence. Federal agencies would be 
directed to furnish requested information to the Commission.

                   title ii--life insurance programs

    Title II of the Committee bill, which is derived from S. 
996 as introduced, would change the name of the Servicemen's 
Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program, merge Retired Reservist 
SGLI into the Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) program, 
extend VGLI insurance benefits to members of the Ready 
Reserves, and authorize conversion of VGLI policies to 
individual commercial policies at any time.

Background

    VA administers six life insurance programs, and supervises 
the administration of two other insurance programs, for the 
benefit of service members, veterans, and their beneficiaries. 
At the end of 1995, the total amount of insurance under these 
programs was over $491 billion. The two programs supervised by 
VA, but administered under a contractual agreement by the 
Prudential Insurance Company, are the Servicemen's Group Life 
Insurance program and Veterans' Group Life Insurance program.
    The SGLI program provides low-cost group life insurance 
protection to service members on active duty and to ready 
reservists, retired reservists, members of the Commissioned 
Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
and the Public Health Service, cadets and midshipmen of the 
four service academies, and members of the Reserve Officer 
Training Corps. At the end of 1995, 2.7 million individuals 
were covered under this program.
    The VGLI program provides post-separation insurance by 
facilitating the conversion of SGLI policies into 5-year 
renewable term policies. At the end of 1995, 349,256 enrollees 
had insurance coverage under VGLI.

Committee bill

            Section 202. Renaming of Servicemen's Group Life Insurance
    Section 202 would rename Servicemen's Group Life Insurance 
as ``Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance,'' and make 
conforming amendments elsewhere in provisions of law referring 
to SGLI to make the program's title gender-neutral.
            Section 203. Merger of Retired Reservist Servicemembers' 
                    Group Life Insurance and Veterans' Group Life 
                    Insurance and Extension of Veterans' Group Life 
                    Insurance to Members of the Ready Reserve
    Under current law, when members of the Ready Reserve retire 
with 20 years of service, or are transferred to the Retired 
Reserve under temporary special retirement authority, they may 
continue SGLI coverage in force as Retired Reservist SGLI. Such 
SGLI policies expire when the former Ready Reserve member 
begins receiving retirement pay or reaches age 61, whichever 
comes first. Section 203 would eliminate this time limitation 
on Retired Reservist SGLI by merging Retired Reservist SGLI 
into VGLI, a program which offers lifetime coverage to policy 
holders. Thus, lifetime coverage would be made available to 
retired reservists by providing them access to the Veterans' 
Group Life Insurance program.
    Section 203 would also extend eligibility for Veterans' 
Group Life Insurance coverage to members of the Ready Reserve 
of a uniformed service. Under current law, members of the Ready 
Reserves who separate with fewer than 20 years service are not 
eligible to convert their SGLI policies to VGLI.
            Section 204. Conversion of SGLI and VGLI Policies to 
                    Commercial Life Insurance Policies
    Under current law, service members may not convert SGLI 
insurance policies to commercial policies when they separate 
from service. Rather, they may enroll in VGLI upon separation. 
VGLI policies may be converted into commercial policies, but 
only after they have been held for 5 years.
    Some consumers prefer commercial policies due, for example, 
to the fact that they are ``whole life'' policies. Others 
prefer such policies due to the fact that they are assignable 
(and they may, therefore, be ``cashed out'' before death) in 
some States. The 5-year waiting period now imposed before VGLI 
policies can be converted--and the fact that SGLI policies 
cannot be converted at all--currently block, or delay, consumer 
choice to convert to commercial policies. Section 204 would 
eliminate these restrictions on conversion.

              title iii--miscellaneous benefits provisions

    Title III of the Committee bill, which is derived from S. 
281, S. 749, S. 994, S. 995, S. 1342, and S. 1751, and also 
contains original provisions, would make various changes in law 
as outlined below.

Section 301. Expansion of period of vietnam era for certain veterans

    The term ``Vietnam era'' is defined under current law as 
the period between August 5, 1964 (the date of the incident 
which led to the adoption of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) and 
May 7, 1975. Veterans who suffer from certain specified 
diseases are entitled to a presumption of service connection if 
they served within the Republic of Vietnam during ``the Vietnam 
era,'' 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1116, and veterans who so served are also 
eligible for hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care under 
38 U.S.C. Sec. 1710(a)(1)(G), as specified in 38 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1710(e)(1)(A). In addition, all veterans who served within 
the time frame of the ``Vietnam era'' are ``wartime'' veterans 
whether or not they served in the Republic of Vietnam, and are 
thus entitled to veterans benefits, principally pension 
benefits under chapter 15 of title 38, to which ``wartime 
veterans'' alone are entitled.
    United States military personnel were, in fact, serving 
within the borders of the Republic of Vietnam prior to August 
5, 1964, principally as advisors to the armed forces of the 
Republic of South Vietnam.
    Section 301 of the Committee bill would amend the 
definition of ``Vietnam era'' and, for general purposes, define 
the ``Vietnam era'' as beginning on February 28, 1961, the date 
accepted as the date U.S. forces generally began to accompany 
their Vietnamese counterparts on combat operations. It would 
apply that definition, however, only with respect to those 
veterans who actually served within the borders of the Republic 
of Vietnam during that time frame. Thus, the Committee intends 
that, for purposes of benefits made available to ``wartime'' 
veterans only, service between February 28, 1961, and August 4, 
1964, would qualify as ``wartime'' service only if the veteran 
actually served in the Republic of Vietnam during that time 
period.
    Herbicides and defoliants were not in use throughout the 
``Vietnam era'' as that term would be newly defined under the 
Committee bill. Rather, such materials were not introduced into 
the Republic of Vietnam until January 9, 1962. Therefore, 
section 301 of the Committee bill specifies that for purposes 
of sections 1116 and 1710 of title 38--provisions of law which 
specify benefits based on presumptive exposure to herbicides 
and defoliants--the term ``Vietnam era'' would be limited to 
the period between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975. The 
Committee intends that benefits that are premised on presumed 
exposure to defoliants and herbicides shall be available to all 
who served in the Republic of Vietnam when such materials were 
present there, but that they not be extended to those who 
served in the Republic of Vietnam only before such materials 
were introduced.

Section 302. Revision of authority relating to centers for minority 
        veterans and women veterans

    Section 509 of Public Law 103-446 created within VA a 
Center for Minority Veterans, 38 U.S.C. Sec. 317, and a Center 
for Women Veterans, 38 U.S.C. Sec. 318.
    Section 302 of the Committee bill would make a series of 
perfecting, conforming, and technical amendments to sections 
317 and 318 of title 38, United States Code. It would provide 
that the Directors of the two Centers may be either non-career 
or career employees; currently, they must be non-career 
employees. It would provide that the Director of the Center for 
Minority Veterans advise the Secretary of VA on issues relating 
to minority group-focused medical research; currently, the 
Director of the Center for Women Veterans performs a parallel 
function as to research focused on women veterans. It would 
require that the Center for Minority Veterans provide support 
and administrative services to the Advisory Committee on 
Minority Veterans (created pursuant to section 510 of Public 
Law 103-446); currently, the Center for Women Veterans provides 
support services to the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans. 
It would define the term ``minority veteran''; currently, that 
term is not defined. It would clarify the functions of the 
Center for Women Veterans and the Advisory Committees on 
Minority and Women Veterans. Finally, section 302 would extend 
the ``sunset'' date of the Advisory Committee on Minority 
Veterans from December 31, 1997, to December 31, 1999.

Section 303. Outer burial receptacles

    Under current law, the Department of Veterans Affairs 
``shall provide * * * grave liner[s]'' for graves in national 
cemeteries, and the Department of the Army ``may provide'' 
grave liners in Arlington National Cemetery. 38 U.S.C. 
Sec. 2306(d)(1). Grave liners are typically comprised of 
multiple slabs of concrete which are fitted together in the 
grave around the casket. They are not water tight.
    Grave liners reduce maintenance costs at cemeteries by 
preventing the ground over and around the casket from sinking 
and by preventing grave headstones from sinking or tilting. 
Further, apart from considerations purely associated with 
maintenance, grave liners assure the continuation of regular 
surface contours in cemeteries, advancing both aesthetic and 
public safety purposes. Unintended surface irregularities are 
not pleasing to the eye, and they increase the dangers of falls 
and other accidents by cemetery staff and visitors.
    Grave liners are but one type of burial receptacle 
currently available. Another type of receptacle which has 
gained some favor with consumers is a ``burial vault,'' a 
single-piece, water-tight, concrete enclosure for the casket 
which is lowered into the grave ahead of the casket. The 
Committee understands that burial vaults serve all of the 
maintenance, aesthetic, and safety purposes that grave liners 
serve. They are, however, more expensive than grave liners. 
Nonetheless, consumers of burial services at non-VA and 
Department of the Army facilities often choose such vaults, 
reportedly due to their water-tight characteristic.
    Section 303 of the Committee bill would remove the specific 
reference to ``grave liners'' in sections 2306(d)(1) and 
(d)(2), which language might be construed to require, or 
authorize, the providing of grave liners only in National 
Cemetery System (NCS) facilities or in Arlington National 
Cemetery. It would substitute in place of that language the 
term ``outer burial receptacle.'' The Committee intends that VA 
would thereby be required, and the Department of the Army would 
thereby be authorized, to furnish grave liners or burial vaults 
or other casket receptacles as provided by regulations or 
procedures adopted to implement this statutory change. The 
Committee intends that the survivors of deceased persons who 
are eligible for interment in national cemeteries and in 
Arlington National Cemetery be provided with the choices 
available to other consumers. Thus, it intends that they be 
allowed to choose grave liners, burial vaults, or other 
products that might be developed, so long as such choices are 
consistent with the maintenance, aesthetic and public safety 
considerations noted above.
    The Committee is aware that NCS and Department of the Army 
resources are limited. The Committee bill provides, therefore, 
that section 303 shall be implemented in a fashion which 
results in no additional costs being incurred by VA or the 
Department of the Army. Specifically, section 303 states that 
regulations or procedures adopted under section 303 may allow 
persons to elect burial receptacles other than grave liners 
and, if they do, would require them to pay any additional costs 
associated with such products and, in addition, an amount which 
reflects the administrative costs incurred in providing, and 
procuring, that product choice. Section 303 also provides 
flexibility in implementing cost recovery mechanisms by 
authorizing the use of a voucher system.

Section 304. Clarification of eligibility of minors for burial in 
        national cemeteries

    Under current law, an interred veteran's surviving spouse 
when he or she dies, and the interred veteran's children who 
are minors when they die, may be buried with a deceased veteran 
in a national cemetery. 38 U.S.C. Sec. 2402(5). While section 
2402 establishes eligibility of a veteran's ``minor child'' for 
burial in a national cemetery, it does not define the term 
``minor child.'' Since VA defines ``minor child'' in various 
ways for various program purposes, potential confusion may 
arise as to burial eligibility--confusion which would be 
particularly regrettable were it to arise, as here, at a time 
of family distress.
    Section 304 would remove such confusion by statutorily 
defining ``minor child'' for purposes of eligibility for 
interment in a national cemetery. It specifies that, for such 
purposes, a ``minor child'' will be one who is under 21 years 
of age, or one who is under 23 years of age if the child was a 
student at the time of death. The Committee has adopted the 
definition of ``minor child'' that VA had previously 
promulgated by regulation, 38 C.F.R. Sec. 1.620(g). The 
Committee thus intends and expects that there will be no change 
in VA practice as a result of this provision.

Section 305. Extension of authority to treat alternative teacher 
        certification programs as educational institutions for certain 
        educational assistance purposes

    VA beneficiaries are eligible for ``Montgomery GI Bill'' 
(MGIB) educational assistance if they participate in a 
``program of education'' offered by an ``educational 
institution.'' See 38 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3452(b) and 3452(c). 
Section 603(a) of Public Law 103-446 redefined the term 
``educational institution'' in section 3452(c) and thereby 
created a pilot program authorizing the receipt of MGIB 
assistance for participation, through September 30, 1996, in 
training for completion of alternative teacher certification 
programs. Such programs are designed to facilitate the 
certification of persons for teaching positions through 
nontraditional curricula and to encourage the entry into the 
teaching profession of individuals whose undergraduate training 
was not in education.
    Section 305 of the Committee bill would extend this pilot 
program through December 31, 1998.

Section 306. Direct loans to refinance loans under the Native American 
        Veteran Housing Loan Pilot Program

    Public Law 102-547 created a 5-year pilot program for 
direct lending by VA to veterans to finance the purchase or 
construction of homes on U.S. trust lands. 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3762. 
Direct loans are needed because commercial lenders are 
reluctant, even with a VA loan guarantee, to lend to Native 
American veteran-homeowners who wish to buy or build on trust 
lands since such lands cannot be assigned and lenders, 
therefore, cannot foreclose on them.
    VA's other home loan programs allow for facilitated 
refinancing in the event of significant decreases in interest 
rates. When the Native American Housing Loan Pilot Program was 
created, no such provision was included in the pilot program.
    Section 306 would authorize refinancing direct loans to 
borrowers under the Native American Housing Loan Pilot Program 
when interest rates have dropped 1 percentage point below the 
rate borne by the existing loan being refinanced. The Committee 
intends that Native American borrowers, like all borrowers, 
have the benefit of refinancing in situations where interest 
rates have dropped significantly.

Section 307. Clothing allowance for incarcerated veterans

    Under current law, a veteran who has a service-connected 
disability which requires the wearing of a prosthetic device or 
the use of a skin medication which damages the veteran's 
clothing is eligible for a ``clothing allowance.'' The purpose 
of the clothing allowance, which is currently set at $503 per 
year and which is modified from time to time to reflect 
increases in the cost of living, is to assist the veteran in 
offsetting the added cost of clothing incurred as a consequence 
of his or her service-connected disability.
    Incarcerated persons typically receive clothing, as needed, 
from penal authorities at no expense to the incarcerated 
person. In such cases, the incarcerated veteran will have 
incurred no personal expense in replacing clothing damaged by 
his or her prosthetic device or medications. Section 307, 
therefore, would abolish the clothing allowance as to such 
persons if they are furnished clothing without charge by the 
custodial institution. It would do so by reducing the annual 
allowance by 1/365 for each day in excess of 60 days that the 
veteran is incarcerated.

Section 308. Appointment of veterans service organizations as 
        claimants' representatives

    Current law authorizes VA to recognize any individual, and 
certain veterans service organizations, in preparing, 
presenting, and prosecuting claims for VA benefits. See 38 
U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 5902(a)(1), 5903, 5904(a). As a matter of 
practice, VA has recognized any accredited representative of a 
veterans service organization as a particular claimant's 
representative in cases where the claimant has filed a power of 
attorney designating the organization itself or any office or 
representative of that organization. In Leo v. Brown, 8 Vet. 
App. 410 (1995), the Court of Veterans Appeals (CVA) held that 
delivery of a decision by the Board of Veterans'' Appeals (BVA) 
to a service organization office other than the office 
specified by the claimant is defective and that, therefore, an 
apparently late filing of an appeal could not be ruled untimely 
based on the running of a filing deadline from that date of 
defective delivery.
    Section 308 of the Committee bill would amend section 5902 
to authorize VA to treat a power of attorney which names a 
veterans service organization as the claimant's representative 
as naming the entire organization as the representative absent 
an indication in the power of attorney form of a claimant's 
intention to name a specific representative only. Thus, in 
cases where a veterans service organization is named without an 
indication of an intention to limit that naming to a specific 
representative only, VA notifications could be sent to the 
organization at the address designated by the organization for 
the receipt of such notices.

Section 309. Provision of copies of Board of Veterans' Appeals 
        decisions

    Under current law, BVA must ``promptly mail * * * written 
decision[s] to the claimant and the claimant's authorized 
representative.'' 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7104(e). As a matter of 
practice, BVA had, at one time, used methods of delivery other 
than the mails, for example, hand delivery, in supplying copies 
of decisions to claimants' representatives. In Trammell v. 
Brown, 6 Vet. App. 181 (1994), CVA held that a delivery of a 
decision by a method other than the mails does not accord with 
statute, and that an apparently late filing of an appeal by a 
claimant who had received delivery by means other than the 
mails was, therefore, timely filed. See also Davis v. Brown, 7 
Vet. App. 298 (1995).
    Section 309 of the Committee bill would amend section 
7104(e) to authorize BVA, in cases where a claimant has an 
authorized representative, either to mail or to otherwise 
deliver copies of written decisions to the claimant's 
representative. As it would be amended, section 7104(e) would 
continue to mandate that in all cases, that is, whether or not 
the claimant has an authorized representative, copies of 
decisions would be mailed to the claimant. Thus, in cases where 
a claimant has a representative, the Committee intends that 
service of decisions be carried out twice, once, by mail to the 
claimant, and, second, by mail or other means, as specified in 
the statute, to the claimant's representative.

Section 310. Extension of certain authorities for services for homeless 
        veterans

    Section 115 of Public Law 100-322 established a pilot 
program authorizing VA to provide community-based treatment and 
rehabilitation services to homeless veterans. Under this 
authority, VA provides services to homeless veterans, directly 
or by contract, in halfway houses, therapeutic communities, 
psychiatric residential treatment centers, and other community-
based treatment facilities. Under current law, this authority 
expires on December 31, 1997.
    The Homeless Veteran Reintegration Project (HVRP), 42 
U.S.C. Sec. 11448, was authorized by the Stewart B. McKinney 
Homeless Assistance Act, Public Law 100-77, 42 U.S.C. chapter 
119. It authorizes the Secretary of Labor to establish programs 
to assist homeless and indigent veterans in returning to 
productive life. Appropriations for this program are authorized 
through fiscal year 1996 only. See Public Law 104-110, 
Sec. 102(d).
    Section 310 of the Committee bill would authorize $10 
million in appropriations for HVRP for each of two additional 
fiscal years, fiscal years 1997 and 1998. In addition, it would 
extend authority for VA's pilot program for community-based 
treatment and rehabilitation services to homeless veterans 
through calendar year 1998.

    TITLE IV--EMPLOYMENT AND REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF MEMBERS OF THE 
                           UNIFORMED SERVICES

    Title IV of the Committee bill is derived from Title III of 
H.R. 2289, a bill which was approved by the House of 
Representatives on December 12, 1995, and referred to the 
Committee on December 13, 1995. Title IV would make technical 
and clarifying amendments to the Uniformed Services Employment 
and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), Public Law 103-
353.

Background

    Provisions of Federal law relating to the reemployment 
rights of members of the uniformed services date from the 
enactment of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. 
Since that time, employment and reemployment rights have 
remained an element of Federal law. They are currently codified 
in chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code.
    During the 50-plus year history of veterans' reemployment 
laws, the uniformed forces have changed, most notably in recent 
years with the emergence of greater total force 
responsibilities assumed by reserve components. At the same 
time, civilian workplace practices, particularly compensation, 
benefits, and pension practices, have changed. Veterans' 
reemployment laws have been modified over the years in an 
effort to keep pace with such changes. In addition, an overlay 
of Federal case law has developed which, among other things, 
applies the law to evolving circumstances.
    Nonetheless, by 1988, the desirability of undertaking a 
broad review of veterans' reemployment rights laws became 
apparent. An executive branch task force, comprised of 
employees of the Departments of Labor, Defense, and Justice, 
and the Office of Personnel Management, was formed to undertake 
such a review, and to formulate recommended revisions to 
veterans' reemployment rights laws. This task force developed 
recommendations and draft proposals over a 3-year period, and 
legislation to recodify veterans' reemployment rights laws was 
introduced in the 102nd Congress as a direct result of these 
task force deliberations.
    H.R. 1578 was reported on May 9, 1991 (H. Rpt. 102-56), and 
approved by the House of Representatives on May 14, 1991. The 
Senate approved the House measure on October 1, 1992, with 
amendments derived from S. 1095, which had been reported by the 
Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs on November 7, 1991 (S. 
Rpt. 102-203). On October 6, 1992, the House agreed to the 
Senate measure, but with further amendments. Differences 
between the House and Senate bills had not been resolved when 
the 102nd Congress adjourned.
    In the 103rd Congress, H.R. 995, a bill derived from H.R. 
1578 as passed by the House on October 6, 1992, was reported on 
April 28, 1993 (H. Rpt. 103-65), and approved by the House on 
May 4, 1993. In the Senate, S. 843, derived from H.R. 1578, was 
reported on July 1, 1993 (S. Rpt. 103-158), and passed by the 
Senate on November 2, 1993. On November 8, 1993, the Senate 
approved H.R. 995, as amended to substitute the text of S. 843. 
On September 13, 1994, the House approved H.R. 995, as amended, 
with a further amendment, and on September 28, 1994, the Senate 
approved H.R. 995 as so amended, clearing the measure for the 
President. Public Law 103-353, the Uniformed Services 
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), was 
signed into law by the President on October 13, 1994.
    Public Law 103-353 was a relatively lengthy, complex, and 
technical piece of legislation. Accordingly, the Committee 
anticipated that the need for technical and clarifying 
amendments might become apparent when the enforcing agency (the 
Department of Labor), veterans service organizations, and 
employers began to implement USERRA. Recommended amendments of 
a technical and clarifying nature were, in fact, presented to 
the Committee informally by the Department of Labor, and to the 
House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The Ranking Minority 
Member of the House Committee, the Honorable G.V. (``Sonny'') 
Montgomery, introduced a bill, H.R. 1941, on June 28, 1995, 
which incorporated those recommended technical changes. Title 
III of H.R. 2289, as reported by the House Committee on 
Veterans' Affairs on December 11, 1995 (H. Rpt. 104-397), and 
as passed by the House on December 12, 1995, was derived from 
that bill. As indicated above, Title IV of S. 1711 is derived 
from Title III of H.R. 2289.

Committee Bill

            Section 401. Purposes
    Section 4304 of title 38, United States Code, states that 
rights specified in USERRA are terminated if the former service 
member is separated from service with a dishonorable or bad 
conduct discharge, is separated other than under honorable 
conditions as specified by regulation, or, in the case of 
commissioned officers, if the former service member is 
dismissed or dropped from the rolls in accordance with 10 
U.S.C. Sec. 1161. By necessary implication, USERRA rights are 
not terminated in circumstances of separation from the service 
under conditions other than those so specified.
    Section 4301(a)(2) states that one of the purposes of 
USERRA is to ``minimize the disruption to the lives of persons 
performing service * * * by providing for the prompt 
reemployment of such persons upon their completion of such 
service under honorable conditions * * *'' (emphasis added). 
This language might unintentionally create ambiguity with 
respect to the intent of the Congress in stating in section 
4304 that USERRA protections are terminated only under 
conditions as stated in that section and, at the same time, 
appearing to suggest in section 4301 that separation from 
service must have been ``honorable.'' More significantly 
perhaps, questions might be raised concerning when (if ever) 
separation might be less than ``under honorable conditions,'' 
and yet not be within the disqualifying circumstances specified 
in section 4304, and, if such ``in between'' circumstances 
might exist, whether or not USERRA protections are operative.
    Section 401 of the Committee bill would eliminate these 
unintended ambiguities and questions by striking the words 
``under honorable conditions'' from section 4301 of title 38. 
The Committee intends that section 4304, and that section 
alone, specifies when USERRA benefits are unavailable due to 
the character of service of the former service member.
            Section 402. Definitions
    Section 4303(16) of title 38, United States Code, defines 
``uniformed services'' and includes within that definition 
``persons designated by the President in time of war or 
emergency.'' The term ``emergency,'' as used in this context, 
has traditionally been associated with national emergencies; 
therefore, it is commonly modified by the term ``national.'' 
USERRA did not include the modifier ``national'' in its 
definition. It thereby potentially gives rise to questions 
whether a departure from traditional usage was intended and, if 
so, what scope did the Congress intend the term ``emergency'' 
to have.
    The Committee bill would add the modifier ``national'' 
prior to the term ``emergency'' in the definition of 
``uniformed services'' to preclude such confusion. The 
Committee intends that the statutory definition of those in the 
``uniformed services'' include those designated by the 
President in times of ``national emergency'' as that term is 
commonly used.
            Section 403. Discrimination against persons who serve in 
                    the uniformed services and acts of reprisal 
                    prohibited
    Section 4311(b) of title 38, United States Code, provides 
that an employer will be found to have violated the anti-
discrimination provisions of section 4311(a) if the employee's 
membership in, application for membership in, performance of 
duty in, or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed 
services is a motivating factor in the employer's action, 
unless the employer can prove that the action alleged to be 
discriminatory would have been taken in any case.
    Section 4311(c)(1) provides that an employer may not 
retaliate against persons due to certain protected activities. 
In contrast to subsection 4311(b), however, that subsection 
does not set forth the standard for finding violations of this 
anti-retaliation provision, or the burden of proof to be borne 
by employers in defending against claims of retaliation.
    The Committee bill would reorder section 4311 to specify 
the anti-discrimination protections in subsection (a), to 
specify the anti-retaliation protections in subsection (b), and 
to provide in subsection (c) that the standards and burdens of 
proof now described in subsection (b), as described above, 
would apply to both discrimination and retaliation claims.
    The Committee bill would also reconfigure current 
subsection (c)(2) as subsection (d) to clarify that both the 
anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation prohibitions in 
section 4311 apply to any position of employment, including 
positions which are only for brief, nonrecurrent periods as 
described in section 4312(d)(1)(C).
            Section 404. Reemployment rights of persons who serve in 
                    the uniformed services
    Section 4312(a) of title 38, United States Code, specifies 
the reemployment rights of persons who are ``absent from a 
position of employment by reason of service * * *'' Section 
4312(e) sets forth the timeframes within which persons eligible 
for such protections shall return to work after a period of 
service. Section 4312 currently contains no specific provision 
dealing with time off prior to performing service.
    The Congress never intended that USERRA preclude service 
personnel from leaving civilian employment so as to arrive 
timely and safely at the site of service. Accordingly, the 
Committee bill would amend section 4312(a) so that employees 
must be given the time off ``necessitated'' by service. This 
provision is consistent with current law. See Sawyer v. Swift & 
Co., 610 F.Supp. 38, 41-42 (D. Kan. 1985), rev'd on other 
grounds 836 F.2d 1257 (10th Cir. 1988).
    The protections afforded by section 4312 apply to persons 
whose cumulative service does not exceed 5 years. In defining 5 
years for this purpose, section 4312(c)(4)(B) exempts service 
``during a war or during a national emergency * * *''
    The Committee bill would amend section 4312(c)(4)(B) to 
require that for the exemption from the ``5-year rule'' to 
apply, the person affected would have to have been ordered or 
retained on active duty due to--and not merely coincident 
with--the war or national emergency.
    Section 4312(d)(1)(C) provides that an employer is not 
required to reemploy a person who leaves for service from 
employment that was for a ``brief, nonrecurrent period * * *'' 
Section 4312(d)(2)(C) refers to proceedings involving questions 
of whether employment was ``brief'' or ``nonrecurrent,'' but 
that subsection uses different phraseology in describing such 
employment from that used in subsection (d)(1)(C).
    The Committee bill would amend section 4312(d)(2)(C) to 
reflect phraseology that is consistent with that used in 
section 4312(d)(1)(C).
            Section 405. Reemployment positions
    Section 4313 of title 38, United States Code, details the 
positions to which service members are entitled upon 
reinstatement after service. Subsection 4313(a)(4) specifies 
the positions to which persons not qualified for their 
preservice or ``escalator'' positions, for reasons other than 
disability incurred in, or aggravated during, service, will be 
entitled.
    Unlike the subsections of section 4313 which precede it, 
subsection (a)(4) of section 4313 does not provide, as a last 
resort, for reemployment in a position which is the nearest 
approximation of the reemployed person's preservice or 
``escalator'' position. The Committee bill rectifies this 
unintended omission by adding such language to subsection 
4313(a)(4). It also corrects a purely technical error in that 
section.
            Section 406. Leave
    Section 4316(d) of title 38, United States Code, expressly 
allows the service member to choose to use vacation, annual, or 
similar leave with pay while on military leave. This provision 
is intended to preclude an employer from forcing a service 
member to use leave, paid or unpaid, against his or her will.
    Notwithstanding this intent, as shown in the legislative 
history of section 4316(d), see H. Rept. 103-65 at 35, it has 
come to the Committee's attention that questions have arisen 
concerning this provision. Indeed, the Committee has learned 
that some employers are reportedly attempting to require that 
service members use vacation leave while in service when to do 
so is not pursuant to a service member's request.
    The Committee bill would clarify that it is a violation of 
section 4316(d) for an employer to require a service member to 
use paid or unpaid vacation, annual, or similar leave when the 
use of such leave is not requested by the service member. This 
policy, as clarified in the Committee bill, is consistent with 
existing law. See Hilliard v. New Jersey Army Nat'l Guard, 527 
F. Supp. 405 (D. N.J. 1981); Graham v. Hall-McMillan Co., Inc., 
925 F. Supp. 437 (N.D. Miss. 1996).
            Section 407. Health plans
    Section 4317 of title 38, United States Code, contains a 
number of purely technical errors. The Committee bill corrects 
them.
            Section 408. Employee pension benefit plans.
    Section 4318(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code, 
currently allows a reemployed service member to make employee 
contributions or elective deferrals over a period ``whose 
duration is three times the period of the person's service in 
the uniformed services, not to exceed five years.''
    The language of section 4318(b)(2) is susceptible to 
misinterpretation. Specifically, it could be argued that it is 
not entirely clear whether the phrase ``not to exceed five 
years'' refers to the period of service or to the period within 
which employee contributions may be made.
    The Committee bill would amend the language of section 
4318(b)(2) to clarify that reemployed persons shall be entitled 
to make employee contributions up to 5 years after returning to 
employment.
            Section 409. Enforcement of employment or reemployment 
                    rights
    Section 4322(d) of title 38, United States Code, requires 
that the Secretary of Labor ``resolve [each] complaint'' for 
enforcement of employment or reemployment rights which is 
filed. The actual resolution of each filed complaint by the 
Secretary of Labor is a desirable goal. However, as was 
recognized by the Congress by the use of the term 
``unsuccessful'' in sections 4322(e) and 4323(a)(1), it is not 
an achievable one. The Committee bill would modify section 
4322(d) to clarify that the Secretary must ``attempt to'' 
resolve each complaint. It would also modify sections 4322(e), 
4323(a)(1), 4324(a)(1), and 4324(c)(2) to remove the value-
laden term ``unsuccessful.''
    Section 4322(e) refers to the Department of Labor's duty, 
in the event that a complaint is not resolved by that agency, 
to notify persons of their rights to pursue other remedies. In 
the case of complaints against Federal agencies, those remedies 
are specified in section 4324. Claimants may proceed under 
section 4324 against the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
as an employer like any Federal agency, but may also seek 
redress under section 4324 against OPM to assure the execution 
of other OPM duties, for example, its duties on behalf of 
employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central 
Intelligence Agency, and other agencies under section 4315(e). 
In order to clarify that OPM has broader duties beyond those of 
being an employer of its own employees, the Committee bill 
would insert the phrase ``or the Office of Personnel 
Management'' after the term ``Federal executive agency'' in 
sections 4322(e)(2), 4324(b)(1), and 4324(c)(2).
            Section 410. Enforcement of rights with respect to a State 
                    or private employer
    Section 4323(a)(2)(A) of title 38, United States Code, 
refers to a claimant's ``appl[ication] to the Secretary [of 
Labor] for assistance * * * under section 4322(c).'' The 
provision under which such a complaint might be filed before 
the Department of Labor is section 4322(a), not section 
4322(c). The Committee bill amends the citation to section 4322 
in section 4323(a)(2)(A) accordingly. The same citation error 
appears in section 4324(b)(1). The Committee bill also corrects 
that erroneous citation.
            Section 411. Enforcement of rights with respect to Federal 
                    executive agencies
    As is explained above, the Committee bill deletes a 
reference from section 4324(a)(1) of title 38, United States 
Code, to ``unsuccessful'' efforts by the Secretary of Labor to 
resolve complaints; adds a reference in sections 4322(e)(2), 
4324(b)(1), and 4324(c)(2) to the Office of Personnel 
Management; and corrects an erroneous citation to section 
4322(c) in section 4324(b)(1). The Committee bill also makes a 
purely technical correction to section 4324(c)(2) by 
substituting the word ``Office'' for ``employee''.
            Section 412. Enforcement of rights with respect to certain 
                    Federal agencies
    Section 4325(d)(1) of title 38, United States Code, 
currently allows a Federal employee to seek information from 
the Secretary of Labor concerning ``alternative employment in 
the Federal government under this chapter * * *''
    The Secretary of Labor does not maintain information 
concerning alternative Federal employment. Therefore, the 
Committee bill would strike language directing Federal 
employees to that improper source of information.
    The Committee bill also makes a purely technical correction 
to section 4325(d)(1) by substituting the term ``employees'' 
for ``employee''.
            Section 413. Conduct of investigation; subpoenas
    Section 4326(a) of title 38, United States Code, currently 
authorizes the Secretary of Labor to have reasonable access to 
the documents of any person or employer during the course of 
investigations under section 4322(d). This section does not 
currently authorize the Secretary to have reasonable access to 
persons for purposes of gathering evidence and testimony during 
the investigation.
    The Committee bill would rectify this oversight by adding 
such authority.
            Section 414. Transition rules and effective dates
    Section 8(a) of USERRA sets forth the rules of transition 
from prior veterans' reemployment laws to USERRA. Generally, 
the provisions of USERRA apply to reemployment applications 
initiated on or after December 12, 1994, and the provisions of 
prior law apply to reemployment applications initiated prior to 
December 12, 1994. Those rules apply regardless of when the 
uniformed service underlying the reemployment application began 
or ended.
    The Committee has been informed that the above transition 
rules could work a hardship on persons training under orders 
issued pursuant to section 502(f) of title 32, United States 
Code, which provides the authority for the voluntary or 
involuntary activation of National Guard personnel, if that 
service exceeds the basic 5-year service limit imposed by 
section 4312(c) of USERRA. This possibility is especially 
troubling in light of the Supreme Court decision in King v. St. 
Vincent's Hospital, 502 U.S. 215 (1991), where the Court held 
that, under the prior law, there was no service limitation with 
respect to service performed under orders issued pursuant to 32 
U.S.C. Sec. 502(f).
    The Committee bill would rectify the foregoing situation by 
providing that all service performed under orders issued 
pursuant to section 502(f) up to December 12, 1994, would be 
considered under the provisions of prior law for service 
limitation purposes, while all such service performed on or 
after December 12, 1994, would be considered under the 
provisions of USERRA, regardless of when the service began. 
Thus, for example, a service member who was ordered to active 
duty for training under orders issued pursuant to section 
502(f) on January 15, 1990, and who was released from duty on 
January 30, 1996, would have the period January 15, 1990-
December 11, 1994, considered under the service limitation 
provisions of prior law, while the period December 12, 1994-
January 30, 1996, would be considered under the service 
limitation provisions of USERRA. The two time frames would then 
be combined to determine if the service limitations had been 
exceeded.
    Section 8(c)(2) of USERRA provided that the provisions of 
section 4316 of title 38, United States Code relating to 
insurance coverage would apply to ``a person on active duty * * 
*'' Since the term ``service in the uniformed service'' applies 
to active duty service and other classes of service, the 
Committee bill would replace ``active duty'' with the phrase 
``person serving a period of service in the armed forces.''

                             Cost Estimate

    In compliance with paragraph 11(a) of Rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee, based on 
information supplied by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 
estimates that the costs resulting from the enactment of the 
Committee bill (as compared to costs under current law), as 
scored against the current CBO baseline during the remainder of 
FY 1996 and for the first 5 years following enactment, would 
have no effect on direct spending during fiscal years 1996 
through 1998, and would decrease Federal direct spending by $1 
million during each year in fiscal years 1999 through 2002. The 
bill would not affect the budgets of State and local 
governments. The cost estimate provided by CBO, setting forth a 
detailed breakdown of costs follows:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                    Washington, DC, August 1, 1996.
Hon. Alan K. Simpson,
Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1711, the Veterans' 
Benefits Improvement Act of 1996, as ordered reported by the 
Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on July 24, 1996.
    The bill would affect direct spending and thus would be 
subject to pay-as-you-go procedures under section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.
    Attachment.

    The costs of the bill would fall under budget function 700, 
Veterans' Affairs.
    6. Basis of estimate: The estimate assumes enactment of the 
bill by October 1, 1996, and appropriation of the authorized 
amounts for each fiscal year. CBO used historical spending 
rates for estimating outlays.

Direct spending

    The bill contains several provisions that would affect 
direct spending.
    Clothing Allowance for Incarcerated Veterans. Under current 
law, VA pays veterans with service-connected disabilities a 
clothing allowance to accommodate prosthetic devices and other 
medical needs. The average allowance in 1995 was $490. Section 
307 would reduce on a pro rata basis such payments to veterans 
who are incarcerated. Using recent incarceration rates for 
inmates of both federal and state prisons, CBO estimates that 
this provision could involve over 1,000 veterans and save about 
$1 million a year as shown in the table below.

    Alternative Teaching Certificate Program. Section 305 would 
extend VA's authority to pay Montgomery GI Bill benefits to 
veterans who train in state-approved certification programs 
from September 30, 1996, to December 31, 1998. Training usually 
occurs in one of three settings--universities, service centers, 
or school districts. This bill would provide benefits to 
students who train outside of a university setting.
    CBO assumes that the number of people training in these 
programs will remain steady (about 380 per year), and that 
enrollment will continue to be evenly divided between 
university and other settings. Also, CBO assumes that 
participants would train for an average period of about 10 
months. Based on a benefit rate for full-time students of about 
$400 a month of training, the bill would increase costs by 
about $1 million a year for 1998 and 1999. Because there would 
be no more than three months of training for a cohort in 2000, 
the budgetary impact in that year would be insignificant.

    Other Provisions. Several provisions would affect direct 
spending, but would not have a significant budgetary impact. 
Title II of the bill would alter certain veterans life 
insurance programs. Section 301 would start the Vietnam era on 
February 28, 1961, rather than August 4, 1964, and make a small 
number of veterans who served in the Vietnam theater of 
operations eligible for certain pension and compensation 
benefits at an insignificant cost. Sections 308 and 309 would 
address representation before the Board of Veterans Appeals and 
provision of copies of the Board's decisions. Sections 303 and 
304 would clarify eligibility for burial benefits.

Spending subject to appropriations action

    Two provisions would have measurable costs that would be 
subject to appropriations action. These provisions would 
authorize a commission on transitional assistance and 
appropriations for a job training program for homeless 
veterans.
    Commission on Transitional Assistance. Section 105 would 
establish a commission to evaluate federal programs that assist 
members of the Armed Forces and veterans in readjusting to 
civilian life. CBO estimates that the cost for the commission 
would be about $2 million in 1997 and $1 million in 1998. These 
funds would be made available from amounts appropriated for the 
Department of Defense.
    The commission would be composed of 12 members, who would 
be appointed within 90 days of the effective date of the bill. 
Each commissioner would be compensated at a rate equal to Level 
IV of the Executive Schedule. Also, the Chairman would be 
authorized to appoint an executive director whose rate of pay 
could not exceed Level V of the Executive Schedule.
    Authority for the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration 
Projects. The bill would authorize appropriations for the 
Homeless Veterans Job Training Program. The provision specifies 
an authorization level of $10 million a year for 1997 and 1998.
    Other Provisions. Several provisions would affect 
authorization of appropriations, but would not have a 
significant budgetary impact. Section 302 would extend the 
termination date for the Advisory Committee on Minority Affairs 
by two years, from December 31, 1997, to December 31, 1999. 
Section 306 would authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
to refinance loans made under the Native American Veterans 
Direct Loan Program.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-as-you-go 
procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or 
receipts through 1998. The bill would have the following pay-
as-you-go impact:

    8. Estimated cost to State, local, and tribal governments: 
S. 1711 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in 
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) and 
would have no effects on the budgets of state, local, or tribal 
governments.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would 
impose no new federal private-sector mandates as defined in 
Public Law 104-4.
    10. Previous CBO estimates: On May 9, 1996, CBO prepared 
estimates for H.R. 3373 and H.R. 2843, bills having provisions 
on veterans' insurance programs similar to the provisions in 
this bill. On February 6, 1996, CBO also prepared an estimate 
for H.R. 2850, which has the same effect as the provision in 
this bill that clarifies burial eligibility for minors. On June 
21, 1996, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. 3673, which 
contains a provision like section 307 in this bill that limits 
the clothing allowance for incarcerated veterans. H.R. 3763 
also contains a provision to extend the authorization for 
homeless veterans reintegration projects for three years. On 
June 21, 1996, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. 3674, 
which contains a provision to extend permanently education 
benefits for alternative teacher certificate programs. Section 
305 of S. 1711 extends this program to December 31, 1998.

                      Regulatory Impact Statement

    In compliance with paragraph 11(b) of Rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee on Veterans' 
Affairs has made an evaluation of the regulatory impact which 
would be incurred in carrying out the Committee bill. The 
Committee finds that the Committee bill would not entail any 
significant regulation of individuals or businesses or result 
in any significant impact on the personal privacy of any 
individuals, and that the paperwork resulting from enactment 
would be minimal.

                 Tabulation of Votes Cast in Committee

    In compliance with paragraph 7 of rule XXVI of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate, the following is a tabulation of votes 
cast in person or by proxy by members of the Committee on 
Veterans' Affairs at its July 24, 1996, meeting. On that date, 
the Committee, by unanimous voice vote, ordered S. 1711 
reported favorably to the Senate.

 statement of charles l. cragin, chairman, board of veterans' appeals, 
                     department of veterans affairs


    Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
    I am pleased to be here today to present the views of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on several bills. Those 
bills are:
          * * * * * * *
          S. 281, a bill to change the beginning date of the 
        Vietnam era for veterans' benefits purposes;
          S. 749, a bill to revise the authority relating to 
        the VA Center for Minority Veterans and Center for 
        Women Veterans;
          * * * * * * *
          S. 994, a bill to clarify the eligibility of certain 
        minors for burial in national cemeteries;
          S. 995, the ``Veterans' Benefits Reform Act of 
        1995'';
          S. 996, the ``Veterans' Insurance Reform Act of 
        1995'';
          * * * * * * *
          S. 1342, a bill to authorize the Secretary of 
        Veterans Affairs to make loans to refinance loans made 
        to veterans under the Native American Veterans Direct 
        Loan Program;
          S. 1711, a bill to establish a commission to evaluate 
        the programs of the Federal Government that assist 
        members of the Armed Forces and veterans in readjusting 
        to civilian life;
          * * * * * * *
          S. 1751, a bill to revise the procedure for providing 
        claimants and their representatives with copies of 
        Board of Veterans' Appeals decisions and to protect the 
        right of claimants to appoint veterans service 
        organizations as their representatives in claims before 
        VA;
          * * * * * * *
S. 281
    Current 38 U.S.C. Sec. 101(29) defines the term ``Vietnam 
era'' for purposes of veterans' benefits as the period 
beginning on August 5, 1964, and ending on May 7, 1975. S. 281 
would change the beginning date of that period from August 5, 
1964, to December 22, 1961.
    Expansion of the Vietnam era as contemplated by S. 281 
would make veterans separated from the service between December 
22, 1961, and August 5, 1964, and their survivors, potentially 
eligible for veterans' benefits based on wartime service, 
regardless of whether the veterans actually served in Vietnam. 
The primary impact of the change would be to make veterans or 
their survivors potentially eligible for nonservice-connected 
disability and death pension benefits.
    VA's preliminary estimates indicate that S. 281 would have 
significant paygo costs which would require offsets under the 
Budget Enforcement Act. We estimate the increased benefit cost 
of this measure would be $87.2 million in Fiscal Year 1997 and 
$546.2 million for the five-year period Fiscal Year 1997 
through Fiscal Year 2001. In addition, we estimate enactment of 
the bill would result in increased administrative costs of $3.9 
million over the five-year period Fiscal Year 1997 through 
Fiscal Year 2001. In view of these cost implications, we cannot 
support this bill.
S. 749
    S. 749 would revise the statutory authority for VA's Center 
for Minority Veterans and Center for Women Veterans. It would 
make three changes.
    First, the bill would permit the Director of the Center for 
Minority Veterans and the Director of the Center for Women 
Veterans to be career appointees in the Senior Executive 
Service (SES). Currently, these Directors may be only noncareer 
SES appointees. VA supports this change because it gives us 
greater flexibility in selecting those officials and 
potentially allows for greater continuity in the program.
    Second, S. 749 would impose two new duties on the Director 
of the Center for Minority Veterans, thereby making that 
official's duties parallel with those of the Director of the 
Center for Women Veterans. It would require that the Director 
of the Center for Minority Veterans advise the Secretary on 
VA's efforts to have minority veterans included in clinical 
research and on medical knowledge that is or may be pertinent 
to minority veterans. It would also require the Director to 
provide support and administrative services to the Advisory 
Committee on Minority Veterans. VA has no objections to those 
changes.
    Third, S. 749 would require the Advisory Committee on Women 
Veterans and the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans to 
oversee the activities of the corresponding Center, to monitor 
and evaluate the Center's activities, and to report the results 
of this evaluation to the Secretary upon request. VA strongly 
opposes these amendments relating to the monitoring and 
evaluation of the Centers' activities and recommends that this 
section be deleted from the bill. To impose direct programmatic 
oversight duties would exceed the appropriate role of advisory 
committees. Already these external committees have general 
responsibility for annually reviewing and providing 
recommendations (to the Secretary) on issues and VA programs 
and policies affecting the relevant veteran populations.
    The bill would also extend the requirement to have an 
Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans through December 31, 
1999. VA supports this provision.
          * * * * * * *
S. 994
    Among those persons eligible under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 2402 for 
burial in a national cemetery are the minor children of 
veterans and certain other persons eligible for burial in a 
national cemetery. The statute does not define the term ``minor 
child.''
    When Congress enacted the National Cemeteries Act of 1973, 
transferring from the Department of the Army to VA the 
responsibility for operating national cemeteries, it reenacted 
without change the prior title 24 provisions regarding 
eligibility for burial. The Department of the Army, in 
exercising its authority, had interpreted title 24's ``minor 
child'' provision as including children under the age of 21 
years. Because Congress indicated an intent that similar 
eligibility rules should apply under VA's management of the 
National Cemetery System, VA's regulation at 38 C.F.R. 
Sec. 1.620(g) governing burial eligibility generally defines a 
minor child as being under 21 years of age. In keeping with the 
general definition of a ``child'' for title 38 purposes, the 
age limit is 23 years if the individual was pursuing a course 
of instruction at an approved educational institution.
    This situation occasionally causes confusion, since the 
general title 38 definition of ``child'' is in one significant 
respect more restrictive than the regulatory definition of 
``minor child'' for purposes of burial eligibility. Under 38 
U.S.C. Sec. 101(4), an individual is generally not considered a 
``child'' after reaching age 18 unless, as indicated above, the 
individual is pursuing an education. We believe that Congress 
did not intend to restrict burial eligibility in this manner. 
Accordingly, we have proposed that the statute governing burial 
eligibility be amended to incorporate the regulatory definition 
of ``minor child.''
    Because enactment of our proposal would only technically 
clarify the law as it is currently being applied, there would 
be no attendant costs or savings. We therefore support 
enactment of S. 994.
S. 995
    S. 995, the ``Veterans' Benefits Reform Act of 1995,'' is a 
VA proposal to restrict payment of the clothing allowance in 
the case of incarcerated veterans and to create for pension 
purposes a presumption of permanent and total disability for 
veterans over age 65 who are patients in a nursing home.
    Section 2 of the bill would amend chapter 53 of title 38, 
United States Code, to restrict the payment of a clothing 
allowance to incarcerated veterans who are furnished clothing 
without charge by a penal institution. Under 38 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1162, VA is required to pay a clothing allowance to each 
veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears 
or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which tends to 
wear out or tear the veteran's clothing, or who uses medication 
prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-
connected disability and which irreparably damages the 
veteran's outergarments. Although 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5313 limits 
payment of compensation to certain incarcerated veterans, that 
statute does not restrict payment of the clothing allowance to 
them, even though they generally do not pay for their 
institutional clothing.
    A clothing allowance for incarcerated veterans is 
unnecessary where they receive institutional clothing at no 
personal expense. We therefore support legislation to prohibit 
payment of the clothing allowance to veterans who are 
incarcerated in excess of 60 days and are furnished clothing 
without charge by the institution in which they are 
incarcerated. Under this bill, the annual award would be 
reduced on a pro rata basis for each day of incarceration. This 
provision would reduce direct spending by less than $500,000 
annually.
    Section 3 of S. 995 would amend 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1502(a) to 
create a presumption of permanent and total disability for 
pension purposes for veterans 65 years of age or older who are 
patients in a nursing home. Section 8002 of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 1388-342, eliminated the 
presumption of total disability for pension purposes for 
persons 65 years of age and older. As a result, a VA rating 
board currently must evaluate disability before pension can be 
paid to any veteran, regardless of age or physical condition.
    Enactment of this bill would reduce the time necessary to 
process disability-pension claims because, once a veteran's age 
and status as a nursing-home patient are confirmed, it would no 
longer be necessary to develop and evaluate medical evidence 
regarding the veteran's disability.
    Enactment of S. 995 would not affect the integrity of VA's 
pension program because an individual 65 years old who is a 
patient of a nursing home would almost certainly meet the 
current requirements of section 1502(a), which provides that a 
person is considered to be permanently and totally disabled if 
he or she is unemployable as a result of disability reasonably 
certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person 
or suffers from a disease or disorder which justifies a 
determination of permanent, total disability. In addition, VA 
could adopt procedures to reevaluate entitlement to pension if 
a notice of discharge is received from a veteran whose pension 
is based on age and confinement in a nursing home.
    Enactment of this bill would result in estimated annual 
administrative cost savings in excess of $300,000 over the next 
five fiscal years. We support enactment of this bill.
S. 996
    S. 996, the ``Veterans' Insurance Reform Act of 1995,'' is 
another VA proposal. It would change the name of the 
Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) program to 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, merge the Retired 
Reservist SGLI program into the Veterans' Group Life Insurance 
(VGLI) program, extend VGLI coverage to members of the Ready 
Reserve of a uniformed service who separate with less than 20 
years of service, permit an insured to convert a VGLI policy to 
an individual policy of life insurance with a commercial 
insurance company at any time, and permit an insured to convert 
a SGLI policy to an individual policy of life insurance with a 
commercial company upon separation from service. We support 
enactment of this bill.
    Section 2 of S. 996 would amend title 38, United States 
Code, to change the name of the Servicemen's Group Life 
Insurance program to Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance to 
reflect gender neutrality.
    Section 3 of the bill would merge the existing Retired 
Reservist SGLI program into the VGLI program. Currently, when 
members of the Ready Reserve retire with 20 years of service or 
are transferred to the Retired Reserve under the temporary 
special retirement authority provided in 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1331a, 
they may continue their SGLI coverage as Retired Reservist SGLI 
until they receive their retired pay or reach age 61, whichever 
comes first. Members of the Ready Reserve who retire with 20 
years of service also have the option to convert their SGLI 
policy to a commercial life insurance policy. Section 3 of S. 
996 would discontinue the Retired Reservist SGLI program and 
instead place the insured Retired Reservists in the VGLI 
program. This change would benefit Retired Reservists by making 
available the lifetime coverage provided under the VGLI 
program, by giving them a discount when premiums are paid 
annually, by allowing them a longer reinstatement period (five 
years instead of three years), by permitting them to convert 
their coverage to commercial policies, and by allowing them to 
pay their premiums by allotment from their retired pay.
    We recognize that Retired Reservists who are over 44 years 
of age would have to pay increased premiums for the lifetime 
VGLI coverage. For example, the monthly premium for $100,000 of 
SGLI coverage for Retired Reservists who are age 50-54 is 
currently $56, and the monthly premium for $100,000 of VGLI 
coverage for Retired Reservists who are age 50-54 would be $65. 
However, the SGLI Retired Reserve premium rates are currently 
insufficient to cover the cost of death claims in the program. 
The actuarial staffs of both VA and the primary insurer have 
agreed that these premium rates should be increased to the 
level of VGLI premium rates as of July 1, 1996. This increase 
would reduce the subsidy required for the SGLI Retired 
Reservist program from the parent SGLI program. Therefore, even 
without enactment of this bill, the SGLI Retired Reservist 
premium rates will be increased to the same level as the VGLI 
rates. Enactment of S. 996 would not adversely affect any other 
insured member or the SGLI or VGLI program and would involve no 
cost to the Government.
    Section 3 would also extend the benefit of VGLI lifetime 
coverage to members of the Ready Reserve of a uniformed 
service, whom the Department of Defense considers more 
important than ever to our national security. When the 
Veterans' Insurance Act of 1974 was enacted, Congress stated 
that members of the Ready Reserve who separate with less than 
20 years of service would not be eligible to convert their SGLI 
coverage to VGLI, unless they are disabled and uninsurable at 
the time of release. This bill would involve no cost to the 
Government, and it would not adversely affect the SGLI or VGLI 
program.
    Section 4 of the bill would expand the opportunities of 
SGLI and VGLI insureds to convert their coverage to commercial 
life insurance. VGLI coverage is provided under a five-year, 
level-premium, term plan that is renewable every five years for 
life. Premiums are based on the insured's age at the time of 
issue or renewal and are increased accordingly at the beginning 
of each five-year renewal period. Although term policies 
provide low-cost coverage for younger insureds, term insurance 
becomes very expensive for older insureds. Under the current 
law, VGLI insureds have the option of converting their VGLI 
coverage to permanent life coverage with a commercial insurance 
company at the end of each five-year term period. A permanent 
life insurance policy, which provides coverage at a level 
premium throughout the premium-paying period of the policy, is 
an alternative to the ever-increasing cost of term coverage. 
Since the cost of the converted policy increases as the 
insured's age increases, requiring insureds to delay conversion 
until the end of the five-year period increases the cost. For 
example, if a VGLI insured converts his or her policy at age 
41, the monthly premium for $100,000 of whole life coverage 
would be $170. However, under S. 996, if the insured were 
allowed to convert at age 36, rather than waiting until the end 
of the five-year renewal period, the premium would be $133.
    For the same reason, S. 996 would also extend this 
conversion privilege to SGLI insureds at the time of their 
separation from service. Currently, SGLI insureds must first 
convert to VGLI and thereafter can convert their VGLI policy to 
a commercial permanent life policy at the end of their five-
year VGLI period. This wait increases the cost of conversion to 
a commercial life policy as discussed above.
    Expansion of the conversion privilege would increase the 
life insurance options of our insured veterans and lower their 
cost of conversion to a commercial permanent life policy. We do 
not anticipate a negative effect on the SGLI or VGLI program or 
any cost to the Government if this bill is enacted.

S. 1342
    S. 1342 would amend the VA pilot program for direct loans 
to Native American veterans living on trust land. Under this 
bill, VA would be authorized to refinance a loan previously 
made to a Native American veteran under this program with a new 
loan at a lower interest rate.
    VA supports the concept of this bill. The pilot program was 
intended to give Native American veterans living on trust land 
the same access to VA housing benefits as other veterans. This 
amendment would extend the important interest-rate-reduction 
refinancing loan benefit to these veterans.
    VA has two technical concerns regarding this bill. First, 
VA does not believe that Native American veterans should be 
able to request a refinancing loan every time interest rates 
drop slightly. Under the guaranteed loan program, the cost of 
refinancing a loan effectively limits such refinancings to 
situations where interest rates have significantly decreased 
(normally 2 percentage points). Since loans made by VA under 
the pilot program are not likely to involve the same closing 
costs as guaranteed loans made by private lenders, VA believes 
the bill should limit a veteran to one refinancing loan. In the 
alternative, VA would propose that the new loan must bear an 
interest rate that is at least 2 percent per annum lower than 
the interest rate of the loan being refinanced.
    Our second concern relates to entitlement. Under the 
guaranteed loan program, a veteran may obtain an interest-rate-
reduction refinancing loan even though he or she has no loan 
entitlement available for use (having exhausted the entitlement 
to obtain the first loan). As written, the bill would not 
permit a Native American veteran to obtain an interest-rate-
reduction refinancing loan unless the veteran had sufficient 
loan entitlement available for use. That would be unlikely in 
most cases. Accordingly, we suggest that ``paragraph (3)'' on 
lines 12 and 16 of page 2 of the bill be revised to read 
``paragraphs (2) and (3)''.
Additional housing loan items
    VA would urge the Committee to favorably consider two 
additional housing loan items. First, as part of the 
Reinvention of Government initiative, VA recommended 
legislation to permit VA to contract competitively for 
servicing of its loan portfolio. Our proposal is contained in 
section 203 of S. 1345. VA believes it is in the best interests 
of the Government to contract out this function. Several 
provisions of existing law, however, preclude VA from 
privatizing this function in the most effective manner. 
Although this will have a paygo cost of about $4 million a 
year, we expect this to be offset by FTE reductions and other 
discretionary savings of around $8 million a year. It makes 
good management sense, and we urge the enactment of our 
proposal.
    Second, Public Law No. 104-110 extended the sunset for VA's 
enhanced vendee loan sales under 38 U.S.C. Sec. 3720(h) until 
only December 31, 1996. VA's experience is that the private 
securities market where VA must sell its loans prefers a 
guaranty on the certificates issued by the trust in addition to 
a guaranty on the underlying loans. This enhancement gives VA 
the best return without significantly changing VA's exposure to 
loss. Accordingly, we urge that this authority be made 
permanent.
    Permanent extension of this authority would have a paygo 
saving of about $5 million per year.
S. 1711
    S. 1711 would establish a 12-member Commission on Service 
Members and Veterans Transition Assistance funded by the 
Department of Defense to review programs designed to assist 
members of the Armed Forces in making the transition to 
civilian life, evaluate proposals for improving those programs, 
and make recommendations to Congress to enhance the value and 
ensure the continued use of those programs. The objective of S. 
1711 in establishing this Commission is commendable. However, 
since the primary responsibility for supporting the Commission 
will be with the Department of Defense, VA defers to that 
department in this matter.
          * * * * * * *
S. 1751
    S. 1751 would amend title 38, United States Code, to revise 
the procedures for providing claimants and their 
representatives with copies of Board decisions and to protect 
the right of claimants to appoint veterans service 
organizations as their representatives in claims before VA. 
This legislation would permit the Board to provide copies of 
its appellate decisions to claimants'' representatives 
reasonably and efficiently. It would also permit VA to continue 
a longstanding method of claimant representation which has 
proven efficient and beneficial to claimants.
    Section 7104(e) of title 38, United States Code, specifies 
that ``the Board shall promptly mail a copy of its written 
decision to the claimant and the claimant's authorized 
representative (if any).'' In the past, the Board's method of 
``mailing'' a copy of a decision to a representative depended 
on where the representative was located. For a representative 
at the Board's offices in Washington, D.C., a contractor hand-
delivered the Board decision to the representative. For a 
representative at a VA regional office, the Board gave the 
decision to the contractor, who ``bundled'' mail for the 58 VA 
regional offices and delivered the bundles to the United States 
Postal Service. After the United States Postal Service 
delivered the bundles to the VA regional offices, each regional 
office sorted its bundled mail and distributed any Board 
decision to the appropriate representative at that regional 
office. For a representative not at an office at a VA facility, 
the Board mailed its decision directly to the representative.
    This past practice made sense considering the number of 
Board decisions and the number of representatives who have 
offices at VA facilities. The Board decides more than 30,000 
cases per year. In more than 85 percent of those cases, one of 
the various veterans service organizations represents the 
claimant. Often, as authorized by 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5902(a)(2), 
the service organization occupies free office space in either a 
VA regional office or at the Board's offices in Washington, 
D.C. Thus, the Board's past practice of distributing decisions 
to representatives was flexible and efficient.
    This past practice, however, was invalidated by the Court 
of Veterans Appeals. In Trammell v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 181 
(1994), the Court of Veterans Appeals held that an apparently 
late notice of appeal was timely filed because the Board's 
decision-distribution procedure did not accord with 38 U.S.C. 
Sec. 7104(e). In Davis v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 298 (1995), the 
court held that the phrase ``the Board shall promptly mail'' in 
section 7104(e) means that the Board decision ``must be 
correctly addressed, stamped with the proper postage, and 
delivered directly by the [Board] into the custody of the U.S. 
Postal Service.'' Id. at 303. The court then concluded that the 
apparently late notice of appeal in Davis was timely filed. Id. 
at 304.
    The court's interpretation of section 7104(e) disrupts 
logistical approaches the Board has developed over the years to 
provide representatives with copies of its decisions. Indeed, 
it leads to some absurd results. For example, instead of a 
Board employee (or a contractor) simply walking down the hall 
to deliver a Board decision to a service organization 
representative on the same floor, now the employee, not a 
contractor, must place the decision in an envelope, affix 
proper postage, and deliver it directly into the United States 
Postal Service's custody. We understand that the Postal Service 
takes this mail to Maryland for sorting, then returns it to the 
District of Columbia for delivery. The Postal Service delivers 
VA mail to the VA building across the street from the Board's 
offices, where a contractor sorts it for internal delivery. The 
contractor must then carry the Board decision across the street 
to the building housing the Board and the service organization 
representative and deliver it to the representative.
    The Board should be permitted to provide representatives 
with copies of its decisions in a sensible manner. Thus, we 
proposed this legislation to permit the Board to ``send'' its 
decisions to claimants and their representatives by any means 
reasonably calculated to provide them with a copy of the 
decision within the same time a copy of the decision sent by 
first-class mail would be expected to reach them.
    Section 1(b) of S. 1751 would also make a corresponding 
change to 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7266(a)(1), which currently provides 
that, to obtain review by the Court of Veterans Appeals, a 
person adversely affected by a final Board decision must file a 
notice of appeal within 120 days after the date on which notice 
of the decision is mailed pursuant to section 7104(e). Our 
proposed amendment would require that a notice of appeal be 
filed within 120 days after the date on which notice of the 
Board decision is sent pursuant to section 7104(e) to the 
representative or, if none, to the claimant.
    Current law authorizes the Secretary to recognize 
individuals to prepare, present, and prosecute claims for VA 
benefits on behalf of claimants. Section 5904(a) of title 38, 
United States Code, authorizes the Secretary to recognize any 
individual as an agent or attorney for the preparation, 
presentation, and prosecution of VA benefit claims. Section 
5903 of title 38, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary 
to recognize any individual for the preparation, presentation, 
and prosecution of any particular VA benefit claim. In 
addition, section 5902(a)(1) of title 38, United States Code, 
authorizes the Secretary to recognize representatives of 
certain veterans service organizations in the preparation, 
presentation, and prosecution of VA benefit claims.
    With respect to representatives of veterans service 
organizations, VA's policy and practice has been to recognize 
any accredited representative of an approved service 
organization if a claimant files a power of attorney in favor 
of the organization itself, a specific office of the 
organization, or a particular representative of the 
organization. This practice affords several advantages. First, 
it allows different representatives of an organization to 
handle a particular claim at different stages of the claim, 
without the claimant having to file a separate power of 
attorney for each representative. For example, a representative 
of an organization at a VA field office can prosecute a claim 
there and initiate an appeal. Another representative of the 
same organization at the organization's national office can 
then argue the claim on appeal before the Board in Washington, 
D.C. Second, it allows different representatives of the 
organization to handle a particular claim at different 
locations and times, without the claimant having to file 
another power of attorney. For example, if a claimant moves 
from New York to Los Angeles while his or her claim is pending, 
a representative of an organization at a local office in New 
York can initially handle the claim there, and another 
representative of the organization at a local office in Los 
Angeles can subsequently pursue the claim at that location. 
Similarly, a second representative of an organization can 
assume responsibility for the prosecution of a claim if the 
original representative of that organization moves, becomes 
incapacitated, or leaves the organization. Third, the practice 
allows VA to notify a claimant's representative in a manner 
best suited to assure notice is received. For example, the 
Board can send a copy of its decision to a representative of a 
given organization in Washington, D.C., as well as to a local 
representative at a field station, thereby doubling the 
likelihood that the claimant's representative will actually 
receive notice.
    Cases recently decided by the Court of Veterans Appeals are 
imperiling VA's longstanding practice of recognizing any 
accredited representative of a veterans service organization in 
a particular claim. In Leo v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 410 (1995), 
the court again held that an apparently late notice of appeal 
was timely filed because the Board's decision-distribution 
procedure did not accord with 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7104(e). In that 
case, the claimant executed a power-of-attorney form in which, 
in the space for designation of a representative, he entered 
the American Legion and the address of the Greenville, South 
Carolina, Veterans Affairs Office, where the American Legion 
had a local representative. The Greenville office stated that 
it had no record of having received a copy of the Board's 
decision on the veteran's claim. The court ruled that actual 
receipt of a copy of the decision by the American Legion's 
national office in Washington, D.C. did not cure the failure to 
mail a copy to the claimant's designated representative, 
``i.e., the Greenville, South Carolina, office.''
    We are concerned that the court may go further and hold 
that, based on the plain meaning of 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5902(a)(1), 
a claimant may appoint only an individual, not an organization, 
to prepare, present, and prosecute a claim before VA on the 
claimant's behalf. Such a holding would play havoc with the 
traditional role of veterans service organizations in the claim 
process and inject additional technical demands into that 
process. If a claimant could appoint only an individual, the 
claimant would have to file another power of attorney each time 
it became necessary or expedient for another accredited 
representative to assist with his or her claim. VA could not 
allow another representative of the same organization access to 
the claimant's files or mail another representative a copy of a 
Board decision without risking violation of the Privacy Act. 
Under the Leo decision, similar problems would frequently arise 
in the cases of claimants who designate a particular office of 
an organization on their power-of-attorney forms.
    A recent survey at the Board showed that 79 percent of 
appellants who designated a veterans service organization on 
their power-of-attorney form (which, as noted above, occurs in 
more than 85 percent of the 30,000 cases that pass through the 
Board each year) designated only the organization, not a 
specific office or an individual representative of the 
organization. Thus, if the court were to invalidate VA's 
practice of recognizing organizations rather than individuals, 
it would cast doubt on the validity and meaning of more than 
25,000 powers of attorney in cases coming before the Board 
alone over one year. It would delay decisions on numerous 
claims while VA tried to clarify which individual 
representative, if any, each appellant wanted to represent him 
or her.
    The impact on the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) 
would be even greater. In 1994, VBA completed action on 
2,127,265 compensation and pension claims. As of December 31, 
1994, national veterans service organizations represented 
approximately 36 percent of the beneficiaries receiving monthly 
VA compensation or pension payments. It would be fair to 
conclude that veterans service organizations represented 
approximately 36 percent of the compensation or pension 
claimants whose cases were handled in 1994. Although VBA does 
not have statistics on the number of claimants who designate 
only an organization (as opposed to a specific office or 
recognized representative of an organization), let us assume 
that, as at the Board, approximately 79 percent of claimants 
represented by service organizations designated only an 
organization on their powers of attorney. Thus, an 
``individuals only'' holding by the court would cast doubt on 
the validity and meaning of nearly 605,000 powers of attorney 
coming before VBA during one year.
    An ``individuals only'' rule would require extensive and 
costly reprogramming of VBA's automated data processing system 
and greatly increase VBA's annual postage costs. In connection 
with claim development, award notification, and routine 
communications concerning awards, VBA's regional offices 
annually produce more than 3 million letters for veterans 
service organizations representing claimants or beneficiaries. 
Currently, the Hines, Illinois computer center prepares and 
mails one copy of each letter to the claimant or beneficiary 
and ships three copies to the appropriate regional office, 
where one copy is filed in the claim folder and two are 
delivered through internal mail to the organization. If 
required to notify individual representatives of organizations 
by mail, VBA would have to reprogram the computer system and, 
most likely, mail the representatives' copies from Hines. 
Postage costs alone could approach $1 million annually. We 
think that such a procedure would waste limited resources, 
particularly since the current procedure provides an efficient 
means of notifying organizations.
    An ``individuals only'' rule would also probably force VBA 
to curtail or eliminate veterans service organizations' access 
to veterans' computer records. Currently, an accredited 
representative of an organization may access the records of any 
veteran represented by that organization. Under an 
``individuals only'' system, however, VBA would have to 
restrict a representative's access to only the files of those 
veterans whose powers of attorney designate that 
representative. The cost of establishing appropriate security 
for the computer files in a system that includes over 6,000 
individual representatives would probably be too great to 
justify continued access to the records. The Board would also 
face a similar problem with access it provides veterans service 
organizations to its computer records.
    Section 2 of S. 1751, which we developed after consulting 
with officials of the major veterans service organizations, 
would address these problems. Section 2(a) would amend section 
5902 of title 38, United States Code, to authorize the 
Secretary to treat a power of attorney naming an organization, 
a specific office of an organization, or a recognized 
representative of an organization as an appointment of the 
entire organization, unless the claimant specifically indicated 
his or her desire to appoint only a recognized representative 
of the organization. Under this amendment, whether a claimant's 
power of attorney is executed in favor of an approved 
organization, a local office of that organization, or an 
individual representative of the organization, the claimant 
could rest assured of the assistance of an accredited 
representative of the organization at every stage of the claim 
or appeal before VA, regardless of location or the inability of 
a particular individual to continue representation, without 
having to file additional powers of attorney.
    Section 2(a) of S. 1751 would also require the Secretary, 
when required or permitted to notify a claimant's 
representative, and when the claimant has appointed a veterans 
service organization as representative, to notify the 
organization at the address designated by the organization for 
the purpose of receiving each kind of notification, unless the 
claimant specifically indicates a desire to appoint only an 
individual representative of the organization.
    Under section 2(b) of S. 1751, the amendments made by 
section 2(a) would apply to any power-of-attorney form filed 
with VA regardless of the date of its execution.
    We estimate minor administrative savings from enactment of 
the provision authorizing the sending of Board decisions, and 
depending on how the Court of Veterans Appeals interprets 
current 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5902(a), enactment of the provision 
regarding the appointment of veterans service organizations as 
claimants'' representatives would likely afford significant 
cost avoidance. We strongly support enactment of this bill.
          * * * * * * *

pleased to answer any questions that you or the members of the 
Committee may have.

    (a)(1) For the purposes of section 1110 of this title, and 
subject to section 1113 of this title--
          (A) a disease specified in paragraph (2) of this 
        subsection becoming manifest as specified in that 
        paragraph in a veteran who, during active military, 
        naval, or air service, served in the Republic of 
        Vietnam [during the Vietnam era] during the period 
        beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 
        1975; and
          (B) each additional disease (if any) that (i) the 
        Secretary determines in regulations prescribed under 
        this section warrants a presumption of service-
        connection by reason of having positive association 
        with exposure to an herbicide agent, and (ii) becomes 
        manifest within the period (if any) prescribed in such 
        regulations in a veteran who, during active military, 
        naval, or air service, served in the Republic of 
        Vietnam [during the Vietnam era] during the period 
        beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 
        1975, and while so serving was exposed to that 
        herbicide agent,
shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated by 
such service, notwithstanding that there is no record of 
evidence of such disease during the period of such service.

        the last date on which the veteran performed active 
        military, naval, or air service in the Republic of 
        Vietnam [during the Vietnam era] during the period 
        beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 
        1975.

(A) not to be insured under this subchapter, or (B) to be

divisible by $10,000. The insurance shall be effective the

the amount of $100,000 or any lesser amount evenly divisible by 
$10,000 upon written application, proof of good health, and 
compliance with such other terms and conditions as may be 
prescribed by the Secretary. Any former member insured under 
Veterans'' Group Life Insurance who again becomes eligible for 
[Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life 
Insurance and declines such coverage solely for the purpose of 
maintaining such member's Veterans' Group Life Insurance in 
effect shall upon termination of coverage under Veterans' Group

    [(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, 
any member who on May 1, 1991 is a member of the Retired

provided under this section, an eligible member may, upon 
application, obtain increased coverage beyond that provided 
under this section in the amount of $100,000, or any lesser 
amount evenly divisible by $10,000.

Sec. 1968. Duration and termination of coverage; conversion

    (a) Each policy purchased under this subchapter shall 
contain a provision, in terms approved by the Secretary, to the

written request of the insured, shall continue in effect while 
the member is on active duty, active duty for training, or 
inactive duty training scheduled in advance by competent 
authority during the period thereof, or while the member meets 
the qualifications set forth in [subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) 
of section 1965(5)] section 1965(5)(B) of this title, and such 
insurance shall cease--

          * * * * * * *
          [(4) with respect to a member of the Ready Reserve of 
        a uniformed service who meets the qualifications set 
        forth in section 1965(5)(B) of this title, one hundred 
        and twenty days after separation or release from such 
        assignment--
                  [(A) unless on the date of such separation or 
                release the member is totally disabled, under 
                criteria established by the Secretary, in which 
                event the insurance shall cease one year after 
                the date of separation or release from such 
                assignment, or on the date the insured ceases 
                to be totally disabled, whichever is the 
                earlier date, but in no event prior to the 
                expiration of one hundred and twenty days after 
                separation or release from such assignment;
                  [(B) unless on the date of such separation or 
                release the member has completed at least 
                twenty years of satisfactory service creditable 
                for retirement purposes under chapter 1223 of 
                title 10 (or under chapter 67 of that title as 
                in effect before the effective date of the 
                Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act) and

                assignment to or is assigned to the Retired 
                Reserve, in which event the insurance, unless 
                converted to an individual policy under terms 
                and conditions set forth in section 1977(e) of 
                this title, shall, upon timely payment of 
                premiums under terms prescribed by the 
                Secretary directly to the administrative office 
                established under section 1966(b) of this 
                title, continue in force until receipt of the 
                first increment of retirement pay by the member 
                or the member's sixty-first birthday, whichever 
                occurs earlier; or

                provided in section 1331a of title 10, in which 
                event the insurance, unless converted to an 
                individual policy under terms and conditions 
                set forth in section 1977(e) of this title, 
                shall, upon timely payment of premiums under 
                terms prescribed by the Secretary directly to 
                the administrative office established under 
                section 1966(b) of this title, continue in 
                force until receipt of the first increment of 
                retirement pay by the member or the member's 
                sixty-first birthday, whichever occurs 
                earlier.]
          (4) with respect to a member of the Ready Reserve of 
        a uniformed service who meets the qualifications set 
        forth in section 1965(5)(B) of this title, one hundred 
        and twenty days after separation or release from such 
        assignment, unless on the date of such separation or 
        release the member is totally disabled, under criteria 
        established by the Secretary, in which event the 
        insurance shall cease one year after the date of 
        separation or release from such assignment, or on the 
        date the insured ceases to be totally disabled, 
        whichever is the earlier date, but in no event prior to 
        the expiration of one hundred and twenty days after 
        separation or release from such assignment.
          [(5) with respect to a member of the Retired Reserve 
        who meets the qualifications of section 1965(5)(C) of 
        this title, and who was assigned to the Retired Reserve 
        prior to the date insurance under the amendment made by 
        section 5(a) of the Veterans'' Insurance Act of 1974 
        (Public Law 93-289, 88 Stat. 166) is placed in effect 
        for members of the Retired Reserve, at such time as the 
        member receives the first increment of retirement pay, 
        or the member's sixty-first birthday, whichever occurs 
        earlier, subject to the timely payment of the initial 
        and subsequent premiums, under terms prescribed by the 
        Secretary, directly to the administrative office 
        established under section 1966(b) of this title.
          [(6) with respect to a member of the Retired Reserve 
        who meets the qualifications of section 1965(5)(D) of 
        this title, at such time as the member receives the

        to the timely payment of the initial and subsequent 
        premiums, under terms prescribed by the Secretary, 
        directly to the administrative office established under 
        section 1966(b) of this title.]
    [(b) Each policy purchased under this subchapter shall 
contain a provision, in terms approved by the Secretary, that, 
except as hereinafter provided, Servicemen's Group Life 
Insurance which is continued in force after expiration of the 
period of duty or travel under section 1967(b) or 1968(a) of 
this title, effective the day after the date such insurance 
would cease, shall be automatically converted to Veterans' 
Group Life Insurance subject to (1) the timely payment of the 
initial premium under terms prescribed by the Secretary, and 
(2) the terms and conditions set forth in section 1977 of this 
title. Such automatic conversion shall be effective only in the 
case of an otherwise eligible member or former member who is 
separated or released from a period of active duty or active 
duty for training or inactive duty training on or after the 
date on which the Veterans' Group Life Insurance program 
(provided for under section 1977 of this title) becomes 
effective. Servicemen's Group Life Insurance continued in force 
under section 1968(a) (4)(B) or (5) of this title shall not be 
converted to Veterans' Group Life Insurance. However, a member 
whose insurance could be continued in force under section 
1968(a)(4)(B) of this title, but is not so continued, may, 
effective the day after the insurance otherwise would cease, 
convert such insurance to an individual policy under the terms 
and conditions set forth in section 1977(e) of this title.]
    (b)(1) Each policy purchased under this subchapter shall 
contain a provision, in terms approved by the Secretary, that, 
except as hereinafter provided, Servicemembers' Group Life 
Insurance which is continued in force after expiration of the 
period of duty or travel under section 1967(b) or 1968(a) of 
this title, effective the day after the date such insurance 
would cease, shall, at the election of the member or former 
member concerned--
          (A) be automatically converted to Veterans' Group 
        Life Insurance subject to (i) the timely payment of the 
        initial premium under terms prescribed by the 
        Secretary, and (ii) the terms and conditions set forth 
        in section 1977 of this title; or
          (B) be converted to an individual policy of insurance 
        as described in section 1977(e) of this title upon 
        written application for conversion made to the 
        participating company selected by the member and 
        payment of the required premiums.
    (2) Automatic conversion under paragraph (1)(A) shall be 
effective only in the case of an otherwise eligible member or 
former member who is separated or released from a period of 
active duty or active duty for training or inactive duty 
training on or after the date on which the Veterans' Group Life 
Insurance program (provided for under section 1977 of this 
title) becomes effective.

Sec. 1969. Deductions; payment; investment; expenses

    (a)(1) During any period in which a member, on active duty 
or active duty for training under a call or order to such duty 
that does not specify a period of less than thirty-one days, is 
insured under [Servicemen's Group Life Insurance]  
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, there shall be deducted 
each month from the member's basic or other pay until 
separation or release from such duty an amount determined by 
the Secretary (which shall be the same for all such members) as 
the share of the cost attributable to insuring such member 
under such policy, less any costs traceable to the extra hazard 
of such duty in the uniformed service.
    (2) During any month in which a member is assigned to the 
Ready Reserve of a uniformed service under conditions which 
meet the qualifications of section 1965(5)(B) of this title, 
[is assigned to the Reserve (other than the Retired Reserve) 
and meets the qualifications of section 1965(5)(C) of this 
title, or is assigned to the Retired Reserve and meets the 
qualifications of section 1965(5)(D) of this title,] and is 
insured under a policy of insurance purchased by the Secretary, 
under section 1966 of this title, there shall be contributed 
from the appropriation made for active duty pay of the 
uniformed service concerned an amount determined by the 
Secretary (which shall be the same for all such members) as the 
share of the cost attributable to insuring such member under 
this policy, less any costs traceable to the extra hazards of 
such duty in the uniformed services. Any amounts so contributed 
on behalf of any individual shall be collected by the Secretary 
concerned from such individual (by deduction from pay or 
otherwise) and shall be credited to the appropriation from 
which such contribution was made.
    (3) * * *
    (4) Any amount not deducted from the basic or other pay of 
a member insured under [Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, or collected from the 
member by the Secretary concerned, if not otherwise paid, shall 
be deducted from the proceeds of any insurance thereafter 
payable. The initial monthly amount under paragraph (1) or (2) 
hereof, or fiscal year amount under paragraph (3) hereof, 
determined by the Secretary to be charged under this section 
for [Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group 
Life Insurance may be continued from year to year, except that 
the Secretary may redetermine such monthly or fiscal year 
amounts from time to time in accordance with experience. No 
refunds will be made to any member of any amount properly 
deducted from the member's basic or other pay, or collected 
from the member by the Secretary concerned, to cover the 
insurance granted under [Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance.
    (b) For each month for which any member is so insured, 
there shall be contributed from the appropriation made for 
active duty pay of the uniformed service concerned an amount 
determined by the Secretary and certified to the Secretary 
concerned to be the cost of Servicemen's Group Life Insurance 
which is traceable to the extra hazard of duty in the uniformed 
services. Effective January 1, 1970, such cost shall be 
determined by the Secretary on the basis of the excess 
mortality incurred by members and former members of the 
uniformed services insured under [Servicemen's Group Life 
Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance above what 
their mortality would have been under peacetime conditions as 
such mortality is determined by the Secretary using such 
methods and data as the Secretary shall determine to be 
reasonable and practicable. The Secretary is authorized to make 
such adjustments regarding contributions from pay 
appropriations as may be indicated from actual experience.
    (c) An amount equal to the first amount due on 
[Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life 
Insurance may be advanced from current appropriations for 
active-service pay to any such member, which amount shall 
constitute a lien upon any service or other pay accruing to the 
person from whom such advance was made and shall be collected 
therefrom if not otherwise paid. No disbursing or certifying

such advance.
    (d)(1) The sums withheld from the basic or other pay of 
members, or collected from them by the Secretary concerned, 
under subsection (a) of this section, and the sums contributed 
from appropriations under subsection (b) of this section, 
together with the income derived from any dividends or premium 
rate adjustments received from insurers shall be deposited to 
the credit of a revolving fund established in the Treasury of 
the United States. All premium payments and extra hazard costs 
on [Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group

such insurance to the company or companies issuing or 
continuing such insurance. Such premiums shall be payable by 
the insureds thereunder as provided by the Secretary directly 
to the administrative office established for such insurance 
under section 1966(b) of this title. The provisions of 
subsections (d) and (e) of section 1971 of this title shall be 
applicable to Servicemen's Group Life Insurance continued in

a uniformed service. However, a separate accounting may be 
required by the Secretary for insurance issued to or continued 
in force on the lives of members assigned to the Retired 
Reserve and for other insurance in force under this subchapter. 
In such accounting, the Secretary is authorized to allocate 
claims and other costs among such programs of insurance 
according to accepted actuarial principles.]
    [(f)] (e) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe 
regulations for the administration of the functions of the 
Secretaries of the military departments under this section.

may consider necessary to ensure that such functions are 
carried out in a timely and complete manner and in accordance 
with the provisions of this section, including specifically the 
provisions of subsection (a)(2) of this section relating to 
contributions from appropriations made for active duty pay.
    [(g)] (f)(1) No tax, fee, or other monetary payment may be

    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, 
payment of matured [Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance or Veterans' Group Life 
Insurance benefits may be made directly to a minor widow or 
widower on his or her own behalf, and payment in such case 
shall be a complete acquittance to the insurer.
    (g) Payments of benefits due or to become due under 
[Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life 
Insurance or Veterans' Group Life Insurance made to, or on 
account of, a beneficiary shall be exempt from taxation, shall 
be exempt from the claims of creditors, and shall not be liable 
to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or 
equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by 
the beneficiary. The preceding sentence shall not apply to (1) 
collection of amounts not deducted from the member's pay, or 
collected from him by the Secretary concerned under section 
1969(a) of this title, (2) levy under subchapter D of chapter 
64 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6331 et

determined by the Secretary, subject to the provision that such 
estimated costs traceable to the extra hazard shall be

service in the Armed Forces of the United States or refuses to 
wear the uniform of such force, shall forfeit all rights to 
[Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life

          * * * * * * *

Sec. 1977. Veterans' Group Life Insurance

    (a) Veterans' Group Life Insurance shall be issued in the 
amounts specified in section 1967(a) [and (e)] of this title. 
In the case of any individual, the amount of Veterans' Group 
Life Insurance may not exceed the amount of [Servicemen's Group 
Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance coverage 
continued in force after the expiration of the period of duty 
or travel under section 1967(b) [and (e)] or 1968(a) of this 
title. No person may carry a combined amount of [Servicemen's 
Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance and 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance in excess of $200,000 at any one 
time. [Any person insured under Veterans' Group Life Insurance 
who again becomes insured under Servicemen's Group Life 
Insurance may within 60 days after becoming so insured convert 
any or all of such person's Veterans' Group Life Insurance to 
an individual policy of insurance under subsection (e). 
However, if such a person dies within the 60-day period and 
before converting such person's Veterans' Group Life Insurance, 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance will be payable only if such 
person is insured for less than $200,000 under Servicemen's 
Group Life Insurance, and then only in an amount which when 
added to the amount of Servicemen's Group Life Insurance 
payable shall not exceed $200,000.] If any person insured under 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance again becomes insured under 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance but dies before 
terminating or converting such person's Veterans' Group Life 
Insurance to Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, Veterans' 
Group Life Insurance will be payable only if such person is 
insured for less than $200,000 under Servicemembers' Group Life 
Insurance, and then only in an amount which when added to the 
amount of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance payable shall 
not exceed $200,000.
    (b) * * *
          * * * * * * *
    (d) Any amount of Veterans' Group Life Insurance in force 
on any person on the date of such person's death shall be paid, 
upon the establishment of a valid claim therefor, pursuant to 
the provisions of section 1970 of this title. However, any 
designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries for [Servicemen's 
Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance 
filed with a uniformed service until changed, shall be 
considered a designation of beneficiary or beneficiaries for 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance, but not for more than sixty 
days after the effective date of the insured's Veterans' Group 
Insurance, unless at the end of such sixty-day period, the 
insured is incompetent in which event such designation may 
continue in force until the disability is removed but not for 
more than five years after the effective date of the insured's 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance. Except as indicated above in 
incompetent cases, after such sixty-day period, any designation 
of beneficiary or beneficiaries for Veterans' Group Life 
Insurance to be effective must be by a writing signed by the 
insured and received by the administrative office established 
under section 1966(b) of this title.
    (e) An insured under Veterans' Group Life Insurance shall 
have the right to convert such insurance to an individual 
policy of life insurance upon written application for 
conversion made to the participating company the insured 
selects and payment of the required premiums. The individual 
policy will be issued without medical examination on a plan 
then currently written by such company which does not provide 
for the payment of any sum less than the face value thereof or 
for the payment of an additional amount as premiums in the 
event the insured performs active duty, active duty for 
training, or inactive duty training. [The individual policy 
will be effective the day after the insured's Veterans' Group 
Life Insurance terminates by expiration of the five-year term 
period, except in a case where the insured is eligible to 
convert at an earlier date by reason of again having become 
insured under Servicemen's Group Life Insurance, in which event 
the effective date of the individual policy may not be later 
than the sixty-first day after the insured again became so 
insured.] A Veterans' Group Life Insurance policy converted to 
an individual policy under this subsection shall terminate on 
the date before the date on which the individual policy becomes 
effective. Upon request to the administrative office 
established under section 1966(b) of this title, an insured 
under Veterans' Group Life Insurance shall be furnished a list 
of life insurance companies participating in the program 
established under this subchapter. In addition to the life 
insurance companies participating in the program established 
under this subchapter, the list furnished to an insured under 
this section shall include additional life insurance companies 
(not so participating) which meet qualifying criteria, terms, 
and conditions established by the Secretary and agree to sell 
insurance to former members in accordance with the provisions 
of this section.
    (f) * * *
    (g) Any person whose [Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] 
Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance was continued in force 
after termination of duty or discharge from service under the 
law as in effect prior to the date on which the Veterans' Group 
Life Insurance program (provided for under section 1977 of this 
title) became effective, and whose coverage under [Servicemen's 
Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance 
terminated less than four years prior to such date, shall be 
eligible within one year from the effective date of the 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance program to apply for and be 
granted Veterans' Group Life Insurance in an amount equal to 
the amount of the insured's Servicemen's Group Life Insurance 
which was not converted to an individual policy under prior 
law. Veterans' Group Life Insurance issued under this 
subsection shall be issued for a term period equal to five 
years, less the time elapsing between the termination of the 
applicant's [Servicemen's Group Life Insurance] Servicemembers' 
Group Life Insurance and the effective date on which the 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance program became effective. 
Veterans' Group Life Insurance under this subsection shall only 
be issued upon application to the administrative office 
established under section 1966(b) of this title, payment of the 
required premium, and proof of good health satisfactory to that 
office, which proof shall be submitted at the applicant's own 
expense. Any person who cannot meet the good health 
requirements for insurance under this subsection solely because 
of a service-connected disability shall have such disability 
waived. For each month for which any eligible veteran, whose 
service-connected disabilities are waived, is insured under 
this subsection there shall be contributed to the insurer or 
insurers issuing the policy or policies from the appropriation 
``Compensation and Pensions, Department of Veterans Affairs'' 
an amount necessary to cover the cost of the insurance in 
excess of the premiums established for eligible veterans, 
including the cost of the excess mortality attributable to such 
veteran's service-connected disabilities. The Secretary may 
establish, as the Secretary may determine to be necessary 
according to sound actuarial principles, a separate premium, 
age groupings for premium purposes, accounting, and reserves, 
for persons granted insurance under this subsection different 
from those established for other persons granted insurance 
under this section. Appropriations to carry out the purpose of 
this section are hereby authorized.

against or take any adverse employment action against any 
person because such person has taken an action to enforce a
