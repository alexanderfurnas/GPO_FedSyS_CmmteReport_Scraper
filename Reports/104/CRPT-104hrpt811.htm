                 A BILL for the relief of Nguyen Quy An

                                PURPOSE

    H.R. 1087 waives the requirements of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act that relate to having the status of an alien 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence, and residence and 
physical presence in the United States and allows Nguyen Quy An 
to apply for naturalization.

                               BACKGROUND

    Major Nguyen Quy An is a 52-year old South Vietnamese 
national currently in the United States on humanitarian parole.
    Major Nguyen Quy An was a South Vietnamese helicopter pilot 
in Vietnam. During the war he saved the lives of four American 
airmen. Later on in the war, the Major sustained injuries which 
resulted in the amputation of both of his arms. As a result of 
his inability to perform work tasks, when he was placed in a 
``re- education'' camp by the North Vietnamese, they expelled 
him from the camp after nine weeks.
    An entry program was set up by the United States to help 
Vietnamese immigrate to this country who were severely punished 
for siding with the United States during the war. One of the 
requirements of that program was that the individual had to 
have been placed in a re-education camp for a period of one 
year. Because the Major was kicked out of the camp after only 
nine weeks, he did not meet the requirement for entry through 
that program.
    The legislation originally included Major An's daughter, 
who is here on humanitarian parole as well. Because Major An 
can file a petition for his daughter, an amendment was adopted 
at Subcommittee to remove the daughter from the legislation. 
The version of this legislation reported by the Subcommittee 
allowed Major An to file for permanent residence. An amendment 
was offered and accepted at full Committee to allow Major An to 
forego the permanent residence period and file for 
naturalization.
    If Major An had not lost his arms, he would have stayed in 
the camp the required time to qualify for entry through the 
program set up for South Vietnamese allies.

                            COMMITTEE ACTION

    On May 23, 1996, the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee sets 
forth, with respect to the bill, H.R. 1087, the following 
estimate and comparison prepared by the Director of the 
Congressional Budget Office under section 403 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 18, 1996.
Hon. Henry J. Hyde,
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 1087, a bill for the relief of Nguyen Quy An, as 
ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on 
September 11, 1996. The bill would exempt Nguyen Quy An from 
meeting certain requirements for naturalization. CBO estimates 
that enacting H.R. 1087 would result in no significant cost to 
the federal government.
    H.R. 1087 would impose no private-sector or 
intergovernmental mandates as defined by the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4), and CBO estimates that 
its enactment would not impose significant costs on the budgets 
of state, local, or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark 
Grabowicz.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                     inflationary impact statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that H.R. 
1087 will have no significant inflationary impact on prices and 
costs in the national economy.

                              agency views

    The comments of the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
are as follows:

                        U.S. Department of Justice,
                    Immigration and Naturalization Service,
                                     Washington, DC, June 12, 1996.
Hon. Henry Hyde,
Chairman, Judiciary Committee,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your request for a report 
relative to H.R. 1087 for the relief of Nguyen Quy An, also 
known as An Quy Nguyen, and Nguyen Ngoc Kim Quy, also known as 
Ngoc Kim Quy Nguyen, there is enclosed a memorandum of 
information concerning the beneficiaries.
    The bill would provide that the beneficiaries would be 
eligible for issuance of immigrant visas or for adjustment of 
status to that of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent 
residence upon filing applications for immigrant visas or for 
adjustment of status. The bill would also require payment of 
appropriate application fees. The bill would further require 
the proper visa number deductions.
            Sincerely,
                                   For the Commissioner,
