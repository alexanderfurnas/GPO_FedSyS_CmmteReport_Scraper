                                  House of Representatives,
                                    Washington, DC, August 2, 1996.
Hon. Newt Gingrich,
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Speaker: By direction of the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight, I submit herewith the 
committee's ninth report to the 104th Congress.

                                   William F. Clinger, Jr.,
                                                          Chairman.

                                     


                                PREFACE

    The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight has long 
believed that effective financial management is critically 
important to making the best decisions on the use of public 
resources in the support of the security and well-being of the 
American people.
    To assist it in fulfilling oversight responsibilities, the 
committee has prepared this compilation of laws on financial 
management, with references to related requirements and 
guidelines issued by Federal agencies. This compilation is 
being released as an investigative report to serve as a 
reference guide in assisting the committee members and staff in 
their work. However, it should also prove useful to our 
congressional colleagues and staff, Government entities, and 
others interested in good stewardship of Federal resources.
    The committee appreciates the assistance of Jeffrey C. 
Steinhoff and Bruce K. Michelson, of the General Accounting 
Office, and Kevin Sabo, the committee's General Counsel, for 
their efforts in preparing this investigative report.

======================================================================

      
                              Introduction

    This report contains the laws related to financial 
management in the federal government as of December 31, 1995, 
and also includes two financial management related laws passed 
during 1996, as explained below. The Print is intended as a 
guide for easy access to the codified laws and references to 
the related requirements and guidelines.
                  laws related to financial management
    The selected provisions of the Code,\1\ as of December 31, 
1995, contained in this report are mostly from Title 31, 
``Money and Finance.'' Title 31 is the primary title containing 
financial management matters. Also included, however, are 
selected sections containing financial management mandates from 
eight other titles. (See appendix I for a further explanation 
of the provisions of the Code included in this report.) Most 
sections of the Code contain supplemental notes providing 
further requirements or explanations. In several sections of 
the Code contained in this Print, notes are provided where 
necessary to assist in interpreting the meaning of the section. 
They are in italic print to differentiate them from the text of 
the Code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The information in this report comes from the United States 
Code Annotated (U.S.C.A.).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition, the full text of the recently enacted Debt 
Collection Improvement Act of 1996, and the Single Audit Act 
Amendments of 1996 are not included in the Code as of December 
31, 1995, but are in this Print. Further, 11 major laws on 
financial management, though appearing in various parts of the 
Code in this Print, are also included separately as originally 
enacted.
       requirements and guidelines issued by agencies or entities
    The laws contained in this report are supplemented by 
references to selected requirements and guidelines issued by 
federal agencies. Where applicable, at the end of each chapter 
of the Code, the related selected references are cited. The 
citations are in italic print to differentiate them from the 
text of the Code.
    The references cited are from seven sources. The first 
source is the requirements contained in the ``Code of Federal 
Regulations'' (C.F.R.). The C.F.R. contains the rules issued by 
agencies and is further explained in appendix II. The next five 
sources are the financial management issuances other than those 
contained in the C.F.R. of the ``oversight'' agencies or 
entities. They are the:
    General Accounting Office (GAO) (see appendix III);
    Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (see appendix IV);
    Department of the Treasury (see appendix V);
    Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) (see 
appendix VI); and
    Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) (see 
appendix VII).
    Each of these five appendices contains a short description 
of the role of the agency or entity and lists the applicable 
selected requirements and guidelines and, the related parts of 
the Code. Appendices III, IV, and V also contain a cross-index 
listing the section of the Code in sequential order followed by 
the applicable requirement or guideline. In addition, each of 
these five appendices include the address and telephone numbers 
of the agency or entity for use in obtaining information or 
acquiring copies of the applicable requirements and guidelines.
    The seventh source of financial management issuances is the 
Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB). Appendix VIII provides 
a brief description of the CASB, its applicability to federal 
financial management, the related section of the Code 
pertaining to it, and portions of the C.F.R. containing the 
standards it issued. The address and telephone number of the 
CASB is provided if additional information is needed.
                            other appendices
    Appendices IX and X provide cross-indexes of important 
financial management laws by popular name and statute citation 
or public law (PL) number.
    Appendix IX lists the major laws by popular name with a 
corresponding reference to the U.S.C. citation and statute 
citation or PL number.\2\ Thus, by knowing only the popular 
name, such as the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, the 
user can identify the U.S.C. citations and the related statute 
or PL number. For example, the Chief Financial Officers Act of 
1990 will cross-index to several U.S.C. citations contained in 
this Print and PL 101-576.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ The Code citation contains all amendments to the law as of 
December 31, 1995, related to the sections of Code included in this 
Print.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Appendix X lists the statute citation (if the law was 
enacted before 1957) or PL number in sequential order cross-
indexed to the popular name of the law. For example, PL 95-510 
will contain a cross-index to: ``Legislative Reorganization Act 
of 1970.''

SEC. 1107. DEFICIENCY AND SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS.

    The President may submit to Congress proposed deficiency 
and supplemental appropriations the President decides are 
necessary because of laws enacted after the submission of the 
budget or that are in the public interest. The President shall 
include the reasons for the submission of the proposed 
appropriations and the reasons the proposed appropriations were 
not included in the budget. When the total proposed 
appropriations would have required the President to make a 
recommendation under section 1105(c) of this title if they had 
been included in the budget, the President shall make a 
recommendation under that section.

SEC. 1108. PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF APPROPRIATIONS REQUESTS TO THE

``agency'' means a department, agency, or instrumentality of 
the United States Government.
    (b)(1) The head of each each agency shall prepare and 
submit to the President each appropriation request for the 
agency. The request shall be prepared and submitted in the form 
prescribed by the President under this chapter and by the date 
established by the President. When the head of an agency does 
not submit a request by that date, the President shall prepare 
the request for the agency to be included in the budget or 
changes in the budget or as deficiency and supplemental 
appropriations. The President may change agency appropriation 
requests. Agency appropriation requests shall be developed from 
cost-based budgets in the way and at times prescribed by the 
President. The head of the agency shall use the cost-based 
budget to administer the agency and to divide appropriations or 
amounts.
    (2) An officer or employee of an agency in the executive 
branch may submit to the President or Congress a request for 
legislation authorizing deficiency or supplemental 
appropriations for the agency only with the approval of the 
head of the agency.
    (c) The head of an agency shall include with an 
appropriation request submitted to the President a report that 
the statement of obligations submitted with the request 
contains obligations consistent with section 1501 of this 
title. The head of the agency shall support the report with a 
certification of the consistency and shall support the 
certification with records showing that the amounts have been 
obligated. The head of the agency shall designate officials to 
make the certifications, and those officials may not delegate 
the duty to make the certifications. The certifications and 
records shall be kept in the agency--
          (1) in a form that makes audits and reconciliations 
        easy; and
          (2) for a period necessary to carry out audits and 
        reconciliations.

of this title) may submit to Congress or a committee of 
Congress an appropriations estimate or request, a request for 
an increase in that estimate or request, or a recommendation on 
meeting the financial needs of the Government only when 
requested by either House of Congress.
    (f) The Interstate Commerce Commission shall submit to 
Congress copies of budget estimates, requests, and information 
(including personnel needs), legislative recommendations, 
prepared testimony for congressional hearings, and comments on 
legislation at the same time they are sent to the President or 
the Office of Management and Budget. An officer of an agency 
may not impose conditions on or impair communication by the 
Commission with Congress, or a committee or member of Congress, 
about the information.
    (g) Amounts available under law are available for field 
examinations of appropriation estimates. The use of the amounts 
is subject only to regulations prescribed by the appropriate 
standing committees of Congress.

change in policy. The President shall state the estimated 
budget outlays and proposed budget authority by function and 
subfunction under the classifications in the budget summary 
table under the heading ``Budget Authority and Outlays by 
Function and Agency'', by major programs in each function, and 
by agency. The President shall also include a statement of the 
economic and program assumptions on which those budget outlays 
and budget authority are based, including inflation, real 
economic growth, and unemployment rates, program caseloads, and 
pay increases.
    (b) The Joint Economic Committee shall review the estimated 
budget outlays and proposed budget authority and submit an 
economic evaluation of the budget outlays and budget authority 
to the Committees on the Budget of both Houses before March 1

activity will continue for more than one year, the request must 
be submitted for at least the first and 2d fiscal years.

SEC. 1111. IMPROVING ECONOMY AND EFFICIENCY.

    To improve economy and efficiency in the United States 
Government, the President shall--

SEC. 1115. PERFORMANCE PLANS.

    (a) In carrying out the provisions of section 1105(a)(29), 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall 
require each agency to prepare an annual performance plan 
covering each program activity set forth in the budget of such 
agency. Such plan shall--
          (1) establish performance goals to define the level 
        of performance to be achieved by a program activity;
          (2) express such goals in an objective, quantifiable, 
        and measurable form unless authorized to be in an 
        alternative form under subsection (b);
          (3) briefly describe the operational processes, 
        skills, and technology, and the human, capital, 
        information, or other resources required to meet the 
        performance goals;
          (4) establish performance indicators to be used in 
        measuring or assessing the relevant outputs, service 
        levels, and outcomes of each program activity;
          (5) provide a basis for comparing actual program 
        results with the established performance goals; and
          (6) describe the means to be used to verify and 
        validate measured values.
    (b) If an agency, in consultation with the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, determines that it is not 
feasible to express the performance goals for a particular 
program activity in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable 
form, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may 
authorize an alternative form. Such alternative form shall--
          (1) include separate descriptive statements of--
                  (A)(i) a minimally effective program, and
                  (ii) a successful program, or
                  (B) such alternative as authorized by the 
                Director of the Office of Management and 
                Budget, with sufficient precision and in such 
                terms that would allow for an accurate, 
                independent determination of whether the 
                program activity's performance meets the 
                criteria of the description; or
          (2) state why it is infeasible or impractical to 
        express a performance goal in any form for the program 
        activity.
    (c) For the purpose of complying with this section, an 
agency may aggregate, disaggregate, or consolidate program 
activities, except that any aggregation or consolidation may 
not omit or minimize the significance of any program activity 
constituting a major function or operation for the agency.
    (d) An agency may submit with its annual performance plan 
an appendix covering any portion of the plan that--
          (1) is specifically authorized under criteria 
        established by an Executive order to be kept secret in 
        the interest of national defense or foreign policy; and
          (2) is properly classified pursuant to such Executive 
        order.
    (e) The functions and activities of this section shall be 
considered to be inherently Governmental functions. The 
drafting of performance plans under this section shall be 
performed only by Federal employees.
    (f) For purposes of this section and sections 1116 through 
1119, and sections 9703 and 9704 the term--
          (1) ``agency'' has the same meaning as such term is 
        defined under section 306(f) of title 5;
          (2) ``outcome measure'' means an assessment of the 
        results of a program activity compared to its intended 
        purpose;
          (3) ``output measure'' means the tabulation, 
        calculation, or recording of activity or effort and can 
        be expressed in a quantitative or qualitative manner;
          (4) ``performance goal'' means a target level of 
        performance expressed as a tangible, measurable 
        objective, against which actual achievement can be 
        compared, including a goal expressed as a quantitative 
        standard, value, or rate;
          (5) ``performance indicator'' means a particular 
        value or characteristic used to measure output or 
        outcome;
          (6) ``program activity'' means a specific activity or 
        project as listed in the program and financing 
        schedules of the annual budget of the United States 
        Government; and
          (7) ``program evaluation'' means an assessment, 
        through objective measurement and systematic analysis, 
        of the manner and extent to which Federal programs 
        achieve intended objectives.

which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided 
by law.
    (b) The reappropriation and diversion of the unexpended

        buildings, or the pay of the Navy and Marine Corps; or
          (2) expressly provides that it is available after the

specifically states that an appropriation is made or that such 
a contract may be made.

SEC. 1302. DETERMINING AMOUNTS APPROPRIATED.

reviewed by the Supreme Court is not allowed after the end of 
the term in which the judgment is affirmed.
    (c)(1) A judgment or compromise settlement against the

        subsection (e), that highly unusual circumstances 
        present a clear and present danger, that an emergency

        the conduct of official business.
Except as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection (d), any

permit the use of a passenger carrier to transport an officer

(1) of subsection (e).

of all Federal agencies in making the determinations authorized 
by subsections (a)(2)(A), (b)(9), and (d)(2) of this section. 
Such regulations shall specify that the comfort and convenience 
of an officer or employee is not sufficient justification for 
authorizations of transportation under this section.
    (2) In promulgating regulations under paragraph (1) of this 
subsection, the Administrator of General Services shall provide 
criteria defining the term ``field work'' for purposes of 
subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section. Such criteria shall

a person requesting or receiving, a Federal contract, grant, 
loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, 
renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, 
grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for 
professional or technical services rendered directly in the 
preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, 
or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or 
cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or 
pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal

                exigency;
                  (B) for perishable subsistence supplies; or

                      Subchapter II--Apportionment

SEC. 1511. DEFINITION AND APPLICATION.

    (a) In this subchapter, ``appropriations'' means--
          (1) appropriated amounts;
          (2) funds; and
          (3) authority to make obligations by contract before 
        appropriations.
  (b) This subchapter does not apply to--
          (1) amounts (except amounts for administrative 
        expenses) available--
                  (A) for price support and surplus removal of 
                agricultural commodities; and
                  (B) under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 
                1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c);
          (2) a corporation getting amounts to make loans 
        (except paid in capital amounts) without legal 
        liability on the part of the United States Government; 
        and
          (3) the Senate, the House of Representatives, a 
        committee of Congress, a member, officer, employee, or 
        office of either House of Congress, or the Office of 
        the Architect of the Capitol or an officer or employee 
        of that Office.

SEC. 1512. APPORTIONMENT AND RESERVES.

    (a) Except as provided in this subchapter, an appropriation 
available for obligation for a definite period shall be 
apportioned to prevent obligation or expenditure at a rate that 
would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or supplemental 
appropriation for the period. An appropriation for an 
indefinite period and authority to make obligations by contract 
before appropriations shall be apportioned to achieve the most 
effective and economical use. An apportionment may be 
reapportioned under this section.
    (b)(1) An appropriation subject to apportionment is 
apportioned by--
          (A) months, calendar quarters, operating seasons, or 
        other time periods;
          (B) activities, functions, projects, or objects; or
          (C) a combination of the ways referred to in clauses 
        (A) and (B) of this paragraph.
    (2) The official designated in section 1513 of this title 
to make apportionments shall apportion an appropriation under 
paragraph (1) of this subsection as the official considers 
appropriate. Except as specified by the official, an amount 
apportioned is available for obligation under the terms of the 
appropriation on a cumulative basis unless reapportioned.
    (c)(1) In apportioning or reapportioning an appropriation, 
a reserve may be established only--
          (A) to provide for contingencies;
          (B) to achieve savings made possible by or through 
        changes in requirements or greater efficiency of 
        operations; or
          (C) as specifically provided by law.
    (2) A reserve established under this subsection may be 
changed as necessary to carry out the scope and objectives of 
the appropriation concerned. When an official designated in 
section 1513 of this title to make apportionments decides that 
an amount reserved will not be required to carry out the 
objectives and scope of the appropriation concerned, the 
official shall recommend the rescission of the amount in the 
way provided in chapter 11 of this title for appropriation 
requests. Reserves established under this section shall be 
reported to Congress as provided in the Impoundment Control Act 
of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 681 et seq.).
    (d) An apportionment or a reapportionment shall be reviewed 
at least 4 times a year by the official designated in section 
1513 of this title to make apportionments.

SEC. 1513. OFFICIALS CONTROLLING APPORTIONMENTS.

    (a) The official having administrative control of an 
appropriation available to the legislative branch, the judicial 
branch, the United States International Trade Commission, or 
the District of Columbia government that is required to be 
apportioned under section 1512 of this title shall apportion 
the appropriation in writing. An appropriation shall be 
apportioned not later than the later of the following:
          (1) 30 days before the beginning of the fiscal year 
        for which the appropriation is available; or
          (2) 30 days after the date of enactment of the law by 
        which the appropriation is made available.
    (b)(1) The President shall apportion in writing an 
appropriation available to an executive agency (except the 
Commission) that is required to be apportioned under section 
1512 of this title. The head of each executive agency to which 
the appropriation is available shall submit to the President 
information required for the apportionment in the form and the 
way and at the time specified by the President. The information 
shall be submitted not later than the later of the following:
          (A) 40 days before the beginning of the fiscal year 
        for which the appropriation is available; or
          (B) 15 days after the date of enactment of the law by 
        which the appropriation is made available.
    (2) The President shall notify the head of the executive 
agency of the action taken in apportioning the appropriation 
under paragraph (1) of this subsection not later than the later 
of the following:
          (A) 20 days before the beginning of the fiscal year 
        for which the appropriation is available; or
          (B) 30 days after the date of enactment of the law by 
        which the appropriation is made available.
    (c) By the first day of each fiscal year, the head of each 
executive department of the United States Government shall 
apportion among the major organizational units of the 
department the maximum amount to be expended by each unit 
during the fiscal year out of each contingent fund appropriated 
for the entire year for the department. Each amount may be 
changed during the fiscal year only by written direction of the 
head of the department. The direction shall state the reasons 
for the change.
    (d) An appropriation apportioned under this subchapter may 
be divided and subdivided administratively within the limits of 
the apportionment.
    (e) This section does not affect the initiation and 
operation of agricultural price support programs.

SEC. 1514. ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION OF APPORTIONMENTS.

    (a) The official having administrative control of an 
appropriation available to the legislative branch, the judicial 
branch, the United States International Trade Commission, or 
the District of Columbia government, and, subject to the 
approval of the President, the head of each executive agency 
(except the Commission) shall prescribe by regulation a system 
of administrative control not inconsistent with accounting 
procedures prescribed under law. The system shall be designed 
to--
          (1) restrict obligations or expenditures from each 
        appropriation to the amount of apportionments or 
        reapportionments of the appropriation; and
          (2) enable the official or the head of the executive 
        agency to fix responsibility for an obligation or 
        expenditure exceeding an apportionment or 
        reapportionment.
    (b) To have a simplified system for administratively 
dividing appropriations, the head of each executive agency 
(except the Commission) shall work toward the objective of 
financing each operating unit, at the highest practical level, 
from not more than one administrative division for each 
appropriation affecting the unit.

SEC. 1515. AUTHORIZED APPORTIONMENTS NECESSITATING DEFICIENCY OR 
                    SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS.

    (a) An appropriation required to be apportioned under 
section 1512 of this title may be apportioned on a basis that 
indicates the need for a deficiency or supplemental 
appropriation to the extent necessary to permit payment of such 
pay increases as may be granted pursuant to law to civilian 
officers and employees (including prevailing rate employees 
whose pay is fixed and adjusted under subchapter IV of chapter 
53 of title 5) and to retired and active military personnel.
    (b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this 
section, an official may make, and the head of an executive 
agency may request, an apportionment under section 1512 of this 
title that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or 
supplemental appropriation only when the official or agency 
head decides that the action is required because of--
          (A) a law enacted after submission to Congress of the 
        estimates for an appropriation that requires an 
        expenditure beyond administrative control; or
          (B) an emergency involving the safety of human life, 
        the protection of property, or the immediate welfare of 
        individuals when an appropriation that would allow the 
        United States Government to pay, or contribute to, 
        amounts required to be paid to individuals in specific 
        amounts fixed by law or under formulas prescribed by 
        law, is insufficient.
    (2) If an official making an apportionment decides that an 
apportionment would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or 
supplemental appropriation, the official shall submit 
immediately a detailed report of the facts to Congress. The 
report shall be referred to in submitting a proposed deficiency 
or supplemental appropriation.

SEC. 1516. EXEMPTIONS.

    An official designated in section 1513 of this title to 
make apportionments may exempt from apportionment--
          (1) a trust fund or working fund if an expenditure 
        from the fund has no significant effect on the 
        financial operations of the United States Government;
          (2) a working capital fund or a revolving fund 
        established for intragovernmental operations;
          (3) receipts from industrial and power operations 
        available under law; and
          (4) appropriations made specifically for--
                  (A) interest on, or retirement of, the public 
                debt;
                  (B) payment of claims, judgments, refunds, 
                and drawbacks;
                  (C) items the President decides are of a 
                confidential nature;
                  (D) payment under a law requiring payment of 
                the total amount of the appropriation to a 
                designated payee; and
                  (E) grants to the States under the Social 
                Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.).

SEC. 1517. PROHIBITED OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENDITURES.

    (a) An officer or employee of the United States Government 
or of the District of Columbia government may not make or 
authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding--
          (1) an apportionment; or
          (2) the amount permitted by regulations prescribed 
        under section 1514(a) of this title.
    (b) If an officer or employee of an executive agency or of 
the District of Columbia government violates subsection (a) of 
this section, the head of the executive agency or the Mayor of 
the District of Columbia, as the case may be, shall report 
immediately to the President and Congress all relevant facts 
and a statement of actions taken.

SEC. 1518. ADVERSE PERSONNEL ACTIONS.

    An officer or employee of the United States Government or 
of the District of Columbia government violating section 
1517(a) of this title shall be subject to appropriate 
administrative discipline including, when circumstances 
warrant, suspension from duty without pay or removal from 
office.

SEC. 1519. CRIMINAL PENALTY.

    An officer or employee of the United States Government or 
of the District of Columbia government knowingly and willfully 
violating section 1517(a) of this title shall be fined not more 
than $5,000, imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or both.

              Subchapter III--Transfers and Reimbursements

SEC. 1531. TRANSFERS OF FUNCTIONS AND ACTIVITIES.

    (a) The balance of an appropriation available and necessary 
to finance or discharge a function or activity transferred or 
assigned under law within an executive agency or from one 
executive agency to another may be transferred to and used--
          (1) by the organizational unit or agency to which the 
        function or activity was transferred or assigned; and
          (2) for a purpose for which the appropriation was 
        originally available.
  (b) The head of the executive agency determines the amount 
that, with the approval of the President, is necessary to be 
transferred when the transfer or assignment of the function or 
activity is within the agency. The President determines the 
amount necessary to be transferred when the transfer or 
assignment of the function or activity is from one executive 
agency to another.
    (c) A balance transferred under this section is--
          (1) credited to an applicable existing or new 
        appropriation account;
          (2) merged with the amount in an account to which the 
        balance is credited; and
          (3) with the amount with which the balance is merged, 
        accounted for as one amount.
    (d) New appropriation accounts may be established to carry 
out subsection (c)(1) of this section.

SEC. 1532. WITHDRAWAL AND CREDIT.

    An amount available under law may be withdrawn from one 
appropriation account and credited to another or to a working 
fund only when authorized by law. Except as specifically 
provided by law, an amount authorized to be withdrawn and 
credited is available for the same purpose and subject to the 
same limitations provided by the law appropriating the amount. 
A withdrawal and credit is made by check and without a warrant.

SEC. 1533. TRANSFERS OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR SALARIES AND EXPENSES TO

assigned to it by using the authority of this section to 
realign its regular programs.

SEC. 1534. ADJUSTMENTS BETWEEN APPROPRIATIONS.

    (a) An appropriation available to an agency may be charged 
at any time during a fiscal year for the benefit of another 
appropriation available to the agency to pay costs--
          (1) when amounts are available in both the 
        appropriation to be charged and the appropriation to be 
        benefited; and
          (2) subject to limitations applicable to the 
        appropriations.
    (b) Amounts paid under this section are charged on a final 
basis during, or as of the close of, the fiscal year to the 
appropriation benefited. The appropriation charged under 
subsection (a) of this section shall be appropriately credited.

in--
          (1) providing goods or services; or
          (2) making an authorized contract with another person 
        to provide the requested goods or services.

        unliquidated obligations applicable to the 
        appropriation less amounts collectible as repayments to

prescribed in this subchapter apply to all appropriations 
unless specifically otherwise authorized by a law that 
specifically--
          (1) identifies the appropriate account for which the 
        availability for expenditure is to be extended;
          (2) provides that such account shall be available for 
        recording, adjusting, and liquidating obligations 
        properly chargeable to that account; and
          (3) extends the availability for expenditure of the 
        obligated balances.

balance (whether obligated or unobligated) in the account shall 
be canceled and thereafter shall not be available for 
obligation or expenditure for any purpose.
    (b) Collections authorized or required to be credited to an

properly chargeable to that account.
    (b)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), after 
the closing of an account under section 1552(a) or 1555 of this 
title, obligations and adjustments to obligations that would

paragraph (1) may not exceed an amount equal to 1 percent of 
the total appropriations for that account.
    (c)(1) In the case of a fixed appropriation account with 
respect to which the period of availability for obligation has 
ended, if an obligation of funds from that account to provide 
funds for a program, project, or activity to cover amounts 
required for contract changes would cause the total amount of 
obligations from that appropriation during a fiscal year for 
contract changes for that program, project, or activity to 
exceed $4,000,000, the obligation may only be made if the 
obligation is approved by the head of the agency (or an officer 
of the agency within the Office of the head of the agency to

respect to which the period of availability for obligation has

obligated from that appropriation during a fiscal year for that 
program, project, or activity to exceed $25,000,000, the 
obligation may not be made until--

        legal basis for the proposed obligation and the policy 
        reasons for the proposed obligation; and

adjustments to pay claims or increases under an escalation

prior action of the Comptroller General.
    (2) This subchapter does not--

          (B) affect the authority of the Comptroller General 
        to settle claims and accounts.

SEC. 1554. AUDIT, CONTROL, AND REPORTING.

        that the obligated balances in each appropriation 
        account of the agency reflect proper existing 
        obligations and that expenditures from the account 
        since the preceding review were supported by a proper 
        obligation of funds and otherwise were proper;
          (F) describe all balances canceled under sections 
        1552 and 1555 of this title.

    An appropriation account available for obligation for an 
indefinite period shall be closed, and any remaining balance 
(whether obligated or unobligated) in that account shall be 
canceled and thereafter shall not be available for obligation

                      TITLE 31--MONEY AND FINANCE

                   Subtitle III--Financial Management

          * * * * * * *

                        CHAPTER 31--PUBLIC DEBT

                   Subchapter I--Borrowing Authority

SEC. 3101. PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT.

    (a) In this section, the current redemption value of an 
obligation issued on a discount basis and redeemable before 
maturity at the option of its holder is deemed to be the face 
amount of the obligation.
    (b) The face amount of obligations issued under this 
chapter and the face amount of obligations whose principal and 
interest are guaranteed by the United States Government (except 
guaranteed obligations held by the Secretary of the Treasury) 
may not be more than $4,900,000,000,000, outstanding at one 
time, subject to changes periodically made in that amount as 
provided by law through the congressional budget process 
described in Rule XLIX of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives or otherwise.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the face amount, for any 
month, of any obligation issued on a discount basis that is not 
redeemable before maturity at the option of the holder of the 
obligation is an amount equal to the sum of--
          (1) the original issue price of the obligation, plus
          (2) the portion of the discount on the obligation 
        attributable to periods before the beginning of such 
        month (as determined under the principles of section 
        1272(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 without 
        regard to any exceptions contained in paragraph (2) of 
        such section).

SEC. 3102. BONDS.

    (a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of 
the Treasury may borrow on the credit of the United States 
Government amounts necessary for expenditures authorized by law 
and may issue bonds of the Government for the amounts borrowed 
and may buy, redeem, and make refunds under section 3111 of 
this title. The Secretary may issue bonds authorized by this 
section to the public and to Government accounts at any annual 
interest rate and prescribe conditions under section 3121 of 
this title.
    (b) The Secretary shall offer the bonds authorized under 
this section first as a popular loan under regulations of the 
Secretary that allow the people of the United States as nearly 
as possible an equal opportunity to participate in subscribing 
to the offered bonds. However, the bonds may be offered in a 
way other than as a popular loan when the Secretary decides the 
other way is in the public interest.
    (c)(1) When the Secretary decides it is in the public 
interest in making a bond offering under this section, the 
Secretary may--
          (A) make full allotments on receiving applications 
        for smaller amounts of bonds to subscribers applying 
        before the closing date the Secretary sets for filing 
        applications;
          (B) reject or reduce allotments on receiving 
        applications filed after the closing date or for larger 
        amounts;
          (C) reject or reduce allotments on receiving 
        applications from incorporated banks and trust 
        companies for their own account and make full 
        allotments or increase allotments to other subscribers; 
        and
          (D) prescribe a graduated scale of allotments.
    (2) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations applying to 
all popular loan subscribers similarly situated governing a 
reduction or increase of an allotment under paragraph (1) of 
this subsection.
    (d) The Secretary may make special arrangements for 
subscriptions from members of the armed forces. However, bonds 
issued to those members must be the same as other bonds of the 
same issue.
    (e) The Secretary may dispose of any part of a bond 
offering not taken and may prescribe the price and way of 
disposition.

SEC. 3103. NOTES.

    (a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of 
the Treasury may borrow on the credit of the United States 
Government amounts necessary for expenditures authorized by law 
and may issue notes of the Government for the amounts borrowed 
and may buy, redeem, and make refunds under section 3111 of 
this title. The Secretary may prescribe conditions under 
section 3121 of this title. Notwithstanding section 3121(a)(5) 
of this title, the payment date of each series of notes issued 
shall be at least one year but not more than 10 years from the 
date of issue.
    (b) The Government may redeem any part of a series of notes 
before maturity by giving at least 4 months' notice but not 
more than one year's notice.
    (c) The holder of a note of one series issued under this 
section with the same issue date as another series of notes 
issued under this section may convert, at par value, a note of 
the holder for a note of the other series.

SEC. 3104. CERTIFICATES OF INDEBTEDNESS AND TREASURY BILLS.

    (a) The Secretary of the Treasury may borrow on the credit 
of the United States Government amounts necessary for 
expenditures authorized by law and may buy, redeem, and make 
refunds under section 3111 of this title. For amounts borrowed, 
the Secretary may issue--
          (1) certificates of indebtedness of the Government; 
        and
          (2) Treasury bills of the Government.
    (b) The Secretary may prescribe conditions for issuing 
certificates of indebtedness and Treasury bills under section 
3121 of this title and conditions under which the certificates 
and bills may be redeemed before maturity. Notwithstanding 
section 3121(a)(5) of this title, the payment date of 
certificates of indebtedness and Treasury bills may not be more 
than one year after the date of issue.
    (c) Treasury bills issued under this section may not be 
accepted before maturity to pay principal or interest on 
obligations of governments of foreign countries that are held 
by the United States Government.

SEC. 3105. SAVINGS BONDS AND SAVINGS CERTIFICATES.

    (a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of 
the Treasury may issue savings bonds and savings certificates 
of the United States Government and may buy, redeem, and make 
refunds under section 3111 of this title. Proceeds from the 
bonds and certificates shall be used for expenditures 
authorized by law. Savings bonds and certificates may be issued 
on an interest-bearing basis, on a discount basis, or on an 
interest-bearing and discount basis. Savings bonds shall mature 
not more than 20 years from the date of issue. Savings 
certificates shall mature not more than 10 years from the date 
of issue. The difference between the price paid and the amount 
received on redeeming a savings bond or certificate is interest 
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
    (b)(1) The Secretary may--
          (A) fix the investment yield for savings bonds; and
          (B) change the investment yield on an outstanding 
        savings bond, except that the yield on a bond for the 
        period held may not be decreased below the minimum 
        yield for the period guaranteed on the date of issue.
    (2) The Secretary may prescribe regulations providing 
that--
          (A) owners of savings bonds may keep the bonds after 
        maturity or after a period beyond maturity during which 
        the bonds have earned interest and continue to earn 
        interest at rates consistent with paragraph (1) of this 
        subsection; and
          (B) savings bonds earning a different rate of 
        interest before the regulations are prescribed shall 
        earn a rate of interest consistent with paragraph (1).
    (c) The Secretary may prescribe for savings bonds and 
savings certificates issued under this section--
          (1) the form and amount of an issue and series;
          (2) the way in which they will be issued;
          (3) the conditions, including restrictions on 
        transfer, to which they will be subject;
          (4) conditions governing their redemption;
          (5) their sales price and denominations;
          (6) a way to evidence payments for or on account of 
        them and to provide for the exchange of savings 
        certificates for savings bonds; and
          (7) the maximum amount issued in a year that may be 
        held by one person.
    (d) The Secretary may authorize financial institutions to 
make payments to redeem savings bonds and savings notes. A 
financial institution may be a paying agent only if the 
institution--
          (1) is incorporated under the laws of the United 
        States, a State, the District of Columbia, or a 
        territory or possession of the United States;
          (2) in the usual course of business accepts, subject 
        to withdrawal, money for deposit or the purchase of 
        shares;
          (3) is under the supervision of a banking authority 
        of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated;
          (4) has a regular office to do business; and
          (5) is qualified under regulations prescribed by the 
        Secretary in carrying out this subsection.
    (e)(1) The Secretary may prescribe a way in which a check 
issued to an individual (except a trust or estate) as a refund 
for taxes imposed under subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) may become a series E savings 
bond. However, a check may become a bond only if the claim for 
a refund is filed by the last day prescribed by law for filing 
the return (determined without any extensions) for the taxable 
year for which the refund is made. The Secretary may prescribe 
the time and way in which the check becomes a bond.
    (2) A bond issued under this subsection is deemed to be a 
series E bond issued under this section, except that the bond 
shall bear an issue date of the first day of the first month 
beginning after the close of the taxable year for which the 
bond is issued. The Secretary also may provide that a bond 
issued to joint payees may be redeemed by either payee alone.

SEC. 3106. RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS BONDS.

    (a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of 
the Treasury may issue retirement and savings bonds of the 
United States Government and may buy, redeem, and make refunds 
under section 3111 of this title. The proceeds from the bonds 
shall be used for expenditures authorized by law. Retirement 
and savings bonds may be issued only on a discount basis. The 
maturity period of the bonds shall be at least 10 years from 
the date of issue but not more than 30 years from the date of 
issue. The difference between the price paid and the amount 
received on redeeming a bond is interest under the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
    (b) With the approval of the President, the Secretary may 
allow owners of retirement and savings bonds to keep the bonds 
after maturity and continue to earn interest on them at rates 
that are consistent with the rate of investment yield provided 
by retirement and savings bonds.
    (c) Section 3105(c)(1)-(5) of this title applies to this 
section. Sections 3105(c)(6) and (d) and 3126 of this title 
apply to this section to the extent consistent with this 
section. The Secretary may prescribe the maximum amount of 
retirement and savings bonds issued under this section in a 
year that may be held by one person. However, the maximum 
amount shall be at least $3,000.

SEC. 3107. INCREASING INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT YIELDS ON 
                    RETIREMENT BONDS.

    With the approval of the President, the Secretary of the 
Treasury may increase by regulation the interest rate or 
investment yield on an offering of bonds issued under this 
chapter that are described in sections 405(b) and 409(a) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 405(b), 409(a)), as in 
effect before the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1984. The 
increased yield shall be for interest accrual periods specified 
in the regulations so that the interest rate or investment 
yield on the bonds for those periods is consistent with the 
interest rate or investment yield on a new offering of those 
bonds.

SEC. 3108. PROHIBITION AGAINST CIRCULATION PRIVILEGE.

    An obligation issued under sections 3102-3104(a)(1) and 
3105-3107 of this title may not bear the circulation privilege.

SEC. 3109. TAX AND LOSS BONDS.

    (a) The Secretary of the Treasury may issue tax and loss 
bonds of the United States Government and may buy, redeem, and 
make refunds under section 3111 of this title. The proceeds of 
the tax and loss bonds shall be used for expenditures 
authorized by law. Tax and loss bonds are nontransferrable 
except as provided by the Secretary, bear no interest, and 
shall be issued in amounts needed to allow persons to comply 
with section 832(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 
U.S.C. 832(e)). The Secretary may prescribe the amount of tax 
and loss bonds and the conditions under which the bonds will be 
issued as required by section 832(e).
    (b) For a taxable year in which amounts are deducted from 
the mortgage guaranty account referred to in section 832(e)(3) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 832(e)(3)), an 
amount of tax and loss bonds bought under section 832(e)(2) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 832(e)(2)) shall 
be redeemed for the amount deducted from the account. The 
amount redeemed shall be applied as necessary to pay taxes due 
because of the inclusion under section 832(b)(1)(E) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 832(b)(1)(E)) of 
amounts in gross income. The Secretary also may prescribe 
additional ways to redeem the bonds.

SEC. 3110. SALE OF OBLIGATIONS OF GOVERNMENTS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

    (a) With the approval of the President, the Secretary of 
the Treasury may sell obligations of the government of a 
foreign country when the obligations were acquired under--
          (1) the First Liberty Bond Act and matured before 
        June 16, 1947;
          (2) the Second Liberty Bond Act and matured before 
        October 16, 1938; or
          (3) section 7(a) of the Victory Liberty Loan Act.
    (b) The Secretary may prescribe the conditions and 
frequency for receiving payment under obligations of a 
government of a foreign country acquired under the laws 
referred to in subsection (a) of this section. A sale of an 
obligation acquired under those Acts shall at least equal the 
purchase price and accrued interest. The proceeds of 
obligations sold under this section and payments received from 
governments on the principal of their obligations shall be used 
to redeem or buy (for not more than par value and accrued 
interest) bonds of the United States Government issued under 
this chapter. If those bonds cannot be redeemed or bought, the 
Secretary shall redeem or buy other outstanding interest-
bearing obligations of the Government that are subject to 
redemption or which can be bought at not more than par value 
and accrued interest.

SEC. 3111. NEW ISSUE USED TO BUY, REDEEM, OR REFUND OUTSTANDING 
                    OBLIGATIONS.

    An obligation may be issued under this chapter to buy, 
redeem, or refund, at or before maturity, outstanding bonds, 
notes, certificates of indebtedness, Treasury bills, or savings 
certificates of the United States Government. Under regulations 
of the Secretary of the Treasury, money received from the sale 
of an obligation and other money in the general fund of the 
Treasury may be used in making the purchases, redemptions, or 
refunds.

SEC. 3112. SINKING FUND FOR RETIRING AND CANCELLING BONDS AND NOTES.

    (a) The Department of the Treasury has a sinking fund for 
retiring bonds and notes issued under this chapter. Amounts in 
the fund are appropriated for payment of bonds and notes at 
maturity or for their redemption or purchase before maturity by 
the Secretary of the Treasury. The fund is available until all 
the bonds and notes are retired.
    (b) For each fiscal year, an amount is appropriated equal 
to--
          (1) the interest that would have been payable during 
        the fiscal year for which the appropriation is made on 
        the bonds and notes bought, redeemed, or paid out of 
        the fund during that or prior years;
          (2) 2.5 percent of the total amount of bonds and 
        notes issued under the First Liberty Bond Act, the 
        Second Liberty Bond Act, the Third Liberty Bond Act, 
        the Fourth Liberty Bond Act, and the Victory Liberty 
        Loan Act and outstanding on July 1, 1920, less an 
        amount equal to the par amount of obligations of 
        governments of foreign countries that the United States 
        Government held on July 1, 1920; and
          (3) 2.5 percent of the total amount expended after 
        June 29, 1933, from appropriations made or authorized 
        in sections 301 and 302 of the Emergency Relief and 
        Construction Act of 1932.
    (c) The Secretary may prescribe the price and conditions 
for paying, redeeming, and buying bonds and notes under this 
section. The average cost of bonds and notes bought under this 
section may not be more than par value and accrued interest. 
Bonds and notes bought, redeemed, or paid out of the sinking 
fund must be canceled and retired and may not be reissued.

SEC. 3113. ACCEPTING GIFTS.

    (a) To provide the people of the United States with an 
opportunity to make gifts to the United States Government to be 
used to reduce the public debt--
          (1) the Secretary of the Treasury may accept for the 
        Government a gift of--
                  (A) money made only on the condition that it 
                be used to reduce the public debt;
                  (B) an obligation of the Government included 
                in the public debt made only on the condition 
                that the obligation be canceled and retired and 
                not reissued; and
                  (C) other intangible personal property made 
                only on the condition that the property is sold 
                and the proceeds from the sale used to reduce 
                the public debt; and
          (2) the Administrator of General Services may accept 
        for the Government a gift of tangible property made 
        only on the condition that it be sold and the proceeds 
        from the sale be used to reduce the public debt.
    (b) The Secretary and the Administrator each may reject a 
gift under this section when the rejection is in the interest 
of the Government.
    (c) The Secretary and the Administrator shall convert a 
gift either of them accepts under subsection (a)(1)(C) or (2) 
of this section to money on the best terms available. If a gift 
accepted under subsection (a) of this section is subject to a 
gift or inheritance tax, the Secretary or the Administrator may 
pay the tax out of the proceeds of the gift or the proceeds of 
the redemption or sale of the gift.
    (d) The Treasury has an account into which money received 
as gifts and proceeds from the sale or redemption of gifts 
under this section shall be deposited. The Secretary shall use 
the money in the account to pay at maturity, or to redeem or 
buy before maturity, an obligation of the Government included 
in the public debt. An obligation of the Government that is 
paid, redeemed, or bought with money from the account shall be 
canceled and retired and may not be reissued. Money deposited 
in the account is appropriated and may be expended to carry out 
this section.
    (e)(1) The Secretary shall redeem a direct obligation of 
the Government bearing interest or sold on a discount basis on 
receiving it when the obligation--
          (A) is given to the Government;
          (B) becomes the property of the Government under the 
        conditions of a trust; or
          (C) is payable on the death of the owner to the 
        Government (or to an officer of the Government in the 
        officer's official capacity).
    (2) If the gift or transfer to the Government is subject to 
a gift or inheritance tax, the Secretary shall pay the tax out

                     Subchapter II--Administrative

SEC. 3121. PROCEDURE.

    (a) In issuing obligations under sections 3102-3104 of this 
title, the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe--
          (1) whether an obligation is to be issued on an 
        interest-bearing basis, a discount basis, or an 
        interest-bearing and discount basis;
          (2) regulations on the conditions under which the 
        obligation will be offered for sale, including whether 
        it will be offered for sale on a competitive or other 
        basis;
          (3) the offering price and interest rate;
          (4) the method of computing the interest rate;
          (5) the dates for paying principal and interest;
          (6) the form and denominations of the obligations; 
        and
          (7) other conditions.
    (b)(1) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an 
obligation issued under this chapter and redeemable on demand 
of the owner or holder may be used to pay the United States 
Government for taxes imposed by it.
    (2) An obligation of the Government issued after March 3, 
1971, under law may not be redeemed before its maturity to pay 
a tax imposed by the Government in an amount more than the fair 
market value of the obligation at the time of its redemption. 
This paragraph does not apply to a Treasury bill issued under 
section 3104 of this title.
    (c) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, an 
obligation authorized by this chapter may be issued in exchange 
for an obligation of an agency whose principal and interest are 
unconditionally guaranteed by the Government at or before 
maturity.
    (d) Under conditions prescribed by the Secretary, the 
Secretary may issue registered bonds in exchange for and 
instead of coupon bonds that have been or may be issued. The 
registered bonds shall be similar in all respects to the 
registered bonds issued under a law authorizing the issue of 
coupon bonds offered for exchange.
    (e) A decision of the Secretary about an issue of 
obligations under sections 3102-3104 of this title is final.
    (f) The Secretary may accept voluntary services in carrying 
out the sale of public debt obligations.
    (g)(1) In this subsection, ``registration-required 
obligation'' means an obligation except an obligation--
          (A) not of a type offered to the public;
          (B) having a maturity (at issue) of not more than one 
        year; or
          (C) described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.
    (2) An obligation is not a registration-required obligation 
if--
          (A) there are arrangements reasonably designed to 
        ensure that the obligation will be sold (or resold in 
        connection with the original issue) only to a person 
        that is not a United States person; and
          (B) for an obligation not in registered form--
                  (i) interest on the obligation is payable 
                only outside the United States and its 
                territories and possessions; and
                  (ii) a statement is on the face of the 
                obligation that a United States person holding 
                the obligation is subject to limitations under 
                the United States income tax laws.
    (3) Every registration-required obligation of the 
Government shall be in registered form. A book entry obligation 
is deemed to be in registered form if the right to principal 
and stated interest on the obligation may be transferred only 
through a book entry consistent with regulations of the 
Secretary.
    (4) The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to 
carry out this subsection when there is a nominee.
    (h)(1) The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation 
standards for the safeguarding and use of obligations issued 
under this chapter, and obligations otherwise issued or 
guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States. 
Such regulations shall apply only to a depository institution 
that is not a government securities broker or a government 
securities dealer and that holds such obligations as fiduciary, 
custodian, or otherwise for the account of a customer and not 
for its own account. Such regulations shall provide for the 
adequate segregation of obligations so held, including 
obligations which are purchased or sold subject to resale or 
repurchase.
    (2) Violation of a regulation prescribed under paragraph 
(1) shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an 
order under section 5239(a) or (b) of the Revised Statutes (12 
U.S.C. 93(a) or (b)), section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act, section 5(d)(2) or 5(d)(3) of the Home 
Owners' Loan Act of 1933, section 407(e) or 407(f) of the 
National Housing Act, or section 206(e) or 206(f) of the 
Federal Credit Union Act. Such an order may be issued with 
respect to a depository institution by its appropriate 
regulatory agency and with respect to a federally insured 
credit union by the National Credit Union Administration Board.
    (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect 
in any way the powers of such agencies under any other 
provision of law.
    (4) The Secretary shall, prior to adopting regulations 
under this subsection, determine with respect to each 
appropriate regulatory agency and the National Credit Union 
Administration Board, whether its rules and standards 
adequately meet the purposes of regulations to be promulgated 
under this subsection, and if the Secretary so determines, 
shall exempt any depository institution subject to such rules 
or standards from the regulations promulgated under this 
subsection.
    (5) As used in this subsection--
          (A) ``depository institution'' has the meaning stated 
        in clauses (i) through (vi) of section 19(b)(1)(A) of 
        the Federal Reserve Act and also includes a foreign 
        bank, an agency or branch of a foreign bank, and a 
        commercial lending company owned or controlled by a 
        foreign bank (as such terms are defined in the 
        International Banking Act of 1978).
          (B) ``government securities broker'' has the meaning 
        prescribed in section 3(a)(43) of the Securities 
        Exchange Act of 1934.
          (C) ``government securities dealer'' has the meaning 
        prescribed in section 3(a)(44) of the Securities 
        Exchange Act of 1934.
          (D) ``appropriate regulatory agency'' has the meaning 
        prescribed in section 3(a)(34)(G) of the Securities 
        Exchange Act of 1934.

SEC. 3122. BANKS AND TRUST COMPANIES AS DEPOSITARIES.

    (a) The Secretary of the Treasury may designate 
incorporated banks and trust companies as depositaries for any 
part of proceeds of an obligation issued under this chapter. 
The Secretary may prescribe the conditions under which deposits 
may be made under this section, including the interest rate on 
amounts deposited and security requirements.
    (b) The Secretary may designate a bank or trust company 
that is a depositary under subsection (a) of this section as a 
fiscal agent of the United States Government in selling and 
delivering bonds and certificates of indebtedness issued by the 
Government.

SEC. 3123. PAYMENT OF OBLIGATIONS AND INTEREST ON THE PUBLIC DEBT.

    (a) The faith of the United States Government is pledged to 
pay, in legal tender, principal and interest on the obligations 
of the Government issued under this chapter.
    (b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay interest due or 
accrued on the public debt. As the Secretary considers 
expedient, the Secretary may pay in advance interest on the 
public debt by a period of not more than one year, with or 
without a rebate of interest on the coupons.
    (c)(1) The Secretary may issue a bond, note, or certificate 
of indebtedness authorized under this chapter whose principal 
and interest are payable in a foreign currency stated in the 
bond, note, or certificate. The Secretary may dispose of the 
bonds, notes, and certificates at a price that is at least par 
value without complying with section 3102(b)-(d) of this title.
    (2) In determining the dollar amount of bonds, notes, and 
certificates of indebtedness that may be issued under this 
chapter, the dollar equivalent of the amount of bonds, notes, 
and certificates payable in a foreign currency is determined by 
the par of the exchange value on the date of issue of the 
bonds, notes, or certificates as published by the Secretary 
under section 5151 of this title.
    (3) The Secretary may designate depositaries in foreign 
countries in which any part of the proceeds of bonds, notes, or 
certificates of indebtedness payable in the foreign currency 
may be deposited.

SEC. 3124. EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION.

    (a) Stocks and obligations of the United States Government 
are exempt from taxation by a State or political subdivision of 
a State. The exemption applies to each form of taxation that 
would require the obligation, the interest on the obligation, 
or both, to be considered in computing a tax, except--
          (1) a nondiscriminatory franchise tax or another 
        nonproperty tax instead of a franchise tax, imposed on 
        a corporation; and
          (2) an estate or inheritance tax.
    (b) The tax status of interest on obligations and 
dividends, earnings, or other income from evidences of 
ownership issued by the Government or an agency and the tax 
treatment of gain and loss from the disposition of those 
obligations and evidences of ownership is decided under the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.). An 
obligation that the Federal Housing Administration had agreed, 
under a contract made before March 1, 1941, to issue at a 
future date, has the tax exemption privileges provided by the 
authorizing law at the time of the contract. This subsection 
does not apply to obligations and evidences of ownership issued 
by the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the 
United States, or a department, agency, instrumentality, or 
political subdivision of the District, territory, or 
possession.

SEC. 3125. RELIEF FOR LOST, STOLEN, DESTROYED, MUTILATED, OR DEFACED 
                    OBLIGATIONS.

    (a) In this section, ``obligation'' means a direct 
obligation of the United States Government issued under law for 
valuable consideration, including bonds, notes, certificates of 
indebtedness, Treasury bills, and interim certificates issued 
for an obligation.
    (b) The Secretary of the Treasury may provide relief for 
the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of an 
obligation identified by number and description.
    (c)(1) An indemnity bond is required as a condition of 
relief if the obligation is payable to bearer or assigned so as 
to become payable to bearer and is not proven clearly to have 
been destroyed. The Secretary may prescribe for the indemnity 
bond the form, amount, and surety or security requirements.
    (2) Relief for interest coupons claimed to have been 
attached to an obligation may be provided only if the Secretary 
is satisfied that the coupons have not been paid and are 
destroyed or will not become the basis of a valid claim against 
the Government.

SEC. 3126. LOSSES AND RELIEF FROM LIABILITY RELATED TO REDEEMING 
                    SAVINGS BONDS AND NOTES.

    (a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, a loss resulting from a payment related to redeeming 
a savings bond or savings note shall be replaced out of the 
fund established by section 2 of the Government Losses in 
Shipment Act (40 U.S.C. 722). A Federal reserve bank, a paying 
agent allowed to make payments in redeeming a bond or note, or 
an officer or employee of the Department of the Treasury is 
relieved from liability to the United States Government for the 
loss when the Secretary decides that the loss did not result 
from the fault or negligence of the bank, paying agent, 
officer, or employee. The Secretary shall relieve the bank, 
agent, officer, or employee from liability when the Secretary 
decides that written notice of liability or potential liability 
has not been given to the bank, agent, officer, or employee by 
the Government within 10 years from the date of the erroneous 
payment. However, the Secretary may not relieve a paying agent 
of an assumed unconditional liability to the Government.
    (b) Section 3 of the Government Losses in Shipment Act (40 
U.S.C. 723) (related to finality of decisions of the Secretary) 
applies to a decision of the Secretary made under this section. 
A recovery or repayment of a loss for which replacement is made 
out of the fund shall be credited to the fund and is available 
for the purposes for which the fund was established.

SEC. 3127. CREDIT TO OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FOR STOLEN 
                    TREASURY NOTES.

    When an officer, employee, or agent of the United States 
Government authorized to receive, redeem, or cancel Treasury 
notes receives or pays a note that was stolen and put in 
circulation after it had been received or redeemed by an 
officer, employee, or agent authorized to receive or redeem the 
note, the Secretary of the Treasury may allow the officer, 
employee, or agent receiving or paying the stolen note a credit 
for the amount of the note. The Secretary may allow the credit 
only if the Secretary is satisfied that the note was received 
or paid in good faith and in exercising ordinary prudence.

SEC. 3128. PROOF OF DEATH TO SUPPORT PAYMENT.

    A finding of death made by an officer or employee of the 
United States Government authorized by law to make the finding 
is sufficient proof of death to allow credit in the accounts of 
a Federal reserve bank or accountable official of the 
Department of the Treasury in a case involving the transfer, 
exchange, reissue, redemption, or payment of obligations of the 
Government, including obligations guaranteed by the Government 
for which the Secretary of the Treasury acts as transfer agent.

SEC. 3129. APPROPRIATION TO PAY EXPENSES.

    (a) Amounts to pay necessary expenses (including rent) for 
an issue of obligations authorized under this chapter are 
appropriated to the Secretary of the Treasury. However, the 
amount appropriated under this section may not be more than--
          (1) .2 percent of the amount of bonds and notes 
        authorized under this chapter;
          (2) .1 percent of the amount of certificates of 
        indebtedness authorized under section 3104 of this 
        title; and
          (3) .1 percent of the amount of certificates of 
        indebtedness authorized under the First Liberty Bond 
        Act.
    (b) An appropriation under this section is available for 
obligation only through the end of the fiscal year after the 
fiscal year in which the issue was made. During a period for 
which an appropriation for a specified amount is made for 
expenses for which this section makes an appropriation for an 
unspecified amount, only the appropriation for the specified 
amount is available for obligation.

SEC. 3130. ANNUAL PUBLIC DEBT REPORT.

    (a) General Rule.--On or before June 1 of each calendar 
year after 1993, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a

                payment; and
          (2) does not include coins and currency of the 
        Government.
    (b) When the Secretary of the Treasury is satisfied that an 
original check is lost, stolen, destroyed in any part, or is so 
defaced that the value to the owner or holder is impaired, the 
Secretary may issue a substitute check to the owner or holder 
of the original check. Except as provided in subsection (c) of 
this section, the substitute check is payable from the amount 
available to pay the original check.
    (c) When the Secretary is satisfied that an original check 
drawn on a depositary in a foreign country or a territory or 
possession of the United States is lost, stolen, destroyed in 
part, or is so defaced that its value to the owner or holder is 
impaired, the drawer of the original check (or another official 
designated by the Secretary with the approval of the head of 
the agency on whose behalf the original check was issued) may 
issue to the owner or holder of the check a substitute check. 
The drawer or official shall issue the substitute check by the 
last day of the fiscal year after the fiscal year in which the 
original check was issued--
          (1) using the current date; and

        been paid;
          (2) shall include information necessary to identify 
        the original check;
          (3) that is drawn on the Treasury--
                  (A) is deemed to be an original check; and
                  (B) is paid under the same conditions as the 
                original check; and

        official from liability to the Government for payment 
        resulting from erroneously issuing the original check.
    (e) Before issuing a substitute check under this section, 
the Secretary may require the owner or holder of the original

of an agency may delegate those duties and powers to an officer 
or employee of the agency.

                official duties when the loss or deficiency 
                occurred, or the loss or deficiency occurred 
                because of an act or failure to act by a 
                subordinate of the official or agent; and
                  (B) the loss or deficiency was not the result 
                of fault or negligence by the official or 
                agent;
          (2) the loss or deficiency was not the result of an 
        illegal or incorrect payment; and
          (3) the Comptroller General agrees with the decision 
        of the head of the agency.
  (b)(1) The Comptroller General shall relieve a disbursing 
official of the armed forces responsible for the physical loss 
or deficiency of public money, vouchers, or records, or shall 
authorize reimbursement, from an appropriation or fund 
available for reimbursement, of the amount of the loss or 
deficiency paid by or for the official as restitution, when--
          (A) the Secretary of Defense or the appropriate 
        Secretary of the military department of the Department 
        of Defense decides that the official was carrying out 
        official duties when the loss or deficiency occurred;
          (B) the loss or deficiency was not the result of an 
        illegal or incorrect payment; and
          (C) the loss or deficiency was not the result of 
        fault or negligence by the official.
  (2) The finding of the Secretary involved is conclusive on 
the Comptroller General.
  (c) On the initiative of the Comptroller General or written 
recommendation of the head of an agency, the Comptroller 
General may relieve a present or former disbursing official of 
the agency responsible for a deficiency in an account because 
of an illegal, improper, or incorrect payment, and credit the 
account for the deficiency, when the Comptroller General 
decides that the payment was not the result of bad faith or 
lack of reasonable care by the official. However, the 
Comptroller General may deny relief when the Comptroller 
General decides the head of the agency did not carry out 
diligently collection action under procedures prescribed by the 
Comptroller General.
  (d)(1) When the Comptroller General decides it is necessary 
to adjust the account of an official or agent granted relief 
under subsection (a) or (c) of this section, the amount of the 
relief shall be charged--
          (A) to an appropriation specifically provided to be 
        charged; or
          (B) if no specific appropriation, to the 
        appropriation or fund available for the expense of the 
        accountable function when the adjustment is carried 
        out.
  (2) Subsection (c) of this section does not--
          (A) affect the liability, or authorize the relief, of 
        a payee, beneficiary, or recipient of an illegal, 
        improper, or incorrect payment; or
          (B) relieve an accountable official, the head of an 
        agency, or the Comptroller General of responsibility in 
        carrying out collection action against a payee, 
        beneficiary, or recipient.

        overpayment occurred only because the administrative 
        audit before payment did not verify transportation 
        rates, freight classifications, or land-grant 
        deductions; or
          (2) provided under a Government bill of lading or 
        transportation request when the overpayment was the 
        result of using improper transportation rates or 
        classifications or the failure to deduct the proper 
        amount under a land-grant law or agreement.

SEC. 3541. DISTRESS WARRANTS.

  (a) When an official receiving public money before it is paid 
to the Treasury or a disbursing or certifying official of the 
United States Government does not submit an account or pay the 
money as prescribed by law, the Comptroller General shall make 
the account for the official and certify to the Secretary of 
the Treasury the amount due the Government.
  (b) The Secretary shall issue a distress warrant against the 
official stating the amount due from the official and any 
amount paid. The warrant shall be directed to the marshal of 
the district in which the official resides. If the Secretary 
intends to take and sell the property of an official that is 
located in a district other than where the official resides, 
the warrant shall be directed to the marshal of the district in 
which the official resides and the marshal of the district in 
which the property is located.

SEC. 3542. CARRYING OUT DISTRESS WARRANTS.

  (a) A marshal carrying out a distress warrant issued under 
section 3541 of this title shall seize the personal property of 
the official and sell the property after giving 10 days notice 
of the sale. Notice shall be given by posting an advertisement 
of the property to be sold in at least 2 public places in the 
town and county in which the property was taken or the town and 
county in which the owner of the property resides. If the 
property does not satisfy the amount due under the warrant, the 
official may be sent to prison until discharged by law.
  (b)(1) The amount due under a warrant is a lien on the real 
property of the official from the date the distress warrant is 
issued. The lien shall be recorded in the office of the clerk 
of the appropriate district court until discharged under law.
  (2) If the personal property of the official is not enough to 
satisfy a distress warrant, the marshal shall sell real 
property of the official after advertising the property for at 
least 3 weeks in at least 3 public places in the county or 
district where the property is located. A buyer of the real 
property has valid title against all persons claiming under the 
official.
  (c) The official shall receive that part of the proceeds of a 
sale remaining after the distress warrant is satisfied and the 
reasonable costs and charges of the sale are paid.

SEC. 3543. POSTPONING A DISTRESS WARRANT PROCEEDING.

  (a) A distress warrant proceeding may be postponed for a 
reasonable time if the Secretary of the Treasury believes the 
public interest will not be harmed by the postponement.
  (b)(1) A person adversely affected by a distress warrant 
issued under section 3541 of this title may bring a civil 
action in a district court of the United States. The complaint 
shall state the kind and extent of the harm. The court may 
grant an injunction to stay any part of a distress warrant 
proceeding required by the action after the person applying for 
the injunction gives a bond in an amount the court prescribes 
for carrying out a judgment.
  (2) An injunction under this subsection does not affect a 
lien under section 3542(b)(1) of this title. The United States 
Government is not required to answer in a civil action brought 
under this subsection.
  (3) If the court dissolves the injunction on a finding that 
the civil action for the injunction was brought only for delay, 
the court may increase the interest rate imposed on amounts 
found due against the complainant to not more than 10 percent a 
year. The judge may grant or dissolve an injunction under this 
subsection either in or out of court.
  (c) A person adversely affected by a refusal to grant an 
injunction or by dissolving an injunction under subsection (b) 
of this section may petition a judge of a circuit court of 
appeals in which the district is located or the Supreme Court 
justice allotted to that circuit by giving the judge or justice 
a copy of the proceeding held before the district judge. The 
judge or justice may grant an injunction or allow an appeal if 
the judge or justice finds the case requires it.

SEC. 3544. RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
                    RESERVED.

States Government has by law to recover a tax, debt, or demand.

SEC. 3545. CIVIL ACTION TO RECOVER MONEY.

amount due to the United States Government on settlement of the 
account of a person accountable for public money when the 
person neglects or refuses to pay the amount to the Treasury. 
Any commission of that person and interest of 6 percent a year 
from the time the money is received by the person until repaid 
to the Treasury shall be added to the amount due on the 
account. The commission is forfeited when judgment is obtained.

         Subchapter II--Claims of the United States Government

SEC. 3711. COLLECTION AND COMPROMISE.

  (a) The head of an executive or legislative agency--
          (1) shall try to collect a claim of the United States 
        Government for money or property arising out of the 
        activities of, or referred to, the agency;
          (2) may compromise a claim of the Government of not 
        more than $100,000 (excluding interest) or such higher 
        amount as the Attorney General may from time to time 
        prescribe that has not been referred to another 
        executive or legislative agency for further collection 
        action; and
          (3) may suspend or end collection action on a claim 
        referred to in clause (2) of this subsection when it 
        appears that no person liable on the claim has the 
        present or prospective ability to pay a significant 
        amount of the claim or the cost of collecting the claim 
        is likely to be more than the amount recovered.
  (b) The Comptroller General has the same authority that the 
head of the agency has under subsection (a) of this section 
when the claim is referred to the Comptroller General for 
further collection action. Only the Comptroller General may 
compromise a claim arising out of an exception the Comptroller 
General makes in the account of an accountable official.
  (c)(1) The head of an executive or legislative agency may not 
act under subsection (a)(2) or (3) of this section on a claim 
that appears to be fraudulent, false, or misrepresented by a 
party with an interest in the claim, or that is based on 
conduct in violation of the antitrust laws.
  (2) The Secretary of Transportation may not compromise for 
less than $500 a penalty under section 21302 of title 49 for a 
violation of chapter 203, 205, or 207 of title 49 or a 
regulation or requirement prescribed or order issued under any 
of those chapters.
  (d) A compromise under this section is final and conclusive 
unless gotten by fraud, misrepresentation, presenting a false 
claim, or mutual mistake of fact. An accountable official is 
not liable for an amount paid or for the value of property lost 
or damaged if the amount or value is not recovered because of a 
compromise under this section.
  (e) The head of an executive or legislative agency acts 
under--
          (1) regulations prescribed by the head of the agency; 
        and
          (2) standards that the Attorney General and the 
        Comptroller General may prescribe jointly.
  (f)(1) When trying to collect a claim of the Government under 
a law except the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et 
seq.), the head of an executive or legislative agency may 
disclose to a consumer reporting agency information from a 
system of records that an individual is responsible for a claim 
if--
          (A) notice required by section 552a(e)(4) of title 5 
        indicates that information in the system may be 
        disclosed to a consumer reporting agency;
          (B) the head of the agency has reviewed the claim and 
        decided that the claim is valid and overdue;
          (C) the head of the agency has notified the 
        individual in writing--
                  (i) that payment of the claim is overdue;
                  (ii) that, within not less than 60 days after 
                sending the notice, the head of the agency 
                intends to disclose to a consumer reporting 
                agency that the individual is responsible for 
                the claim;
                  (iii) of the specific information to be 
                disclosed to the consumer reporting agency; and
                  (iv) of the rights the individual has to a 
                complete explanation of the claim, to dispute 
                information in the records of the agency about 
                the claim, and to administrative repeal or 
                review of the claim;
          (D) the individual has not--
                  (i) repaid or agreed to repay the claim under 
                a written repayment plan that the individual 
                has signed and the head of the agency has 
                agreed to; or
                  (ii) filed for review of the claim under 
                paragraph (2) of this subsection;
          (E) the head of the agency has established procedures 
        to--
                  (i) disclose promptly, to reach consumer 
                reporting agency to which the original 
                disclosure was made, a substantial change in 
                the condition or amount of the claim;
                  (ii) verify or correct promptly information 
                about the claim on request of a consumer 
                reporting agency for verification of 
                information disclosed; and
                  (iii) get satisfactory assurances from each 
                consumer reporting agency that the agency is 
                complying with all laws of the United States 
                related to providing consumer credit 
                information; and
          (F) the information disclosed to the consumer 
        reporting agency is limited to--
                  (i) information necessary to establish the 
                identity of the individual, including name, 
                address, and taxpayer identification number;
                  (ii) the amount, status, and history of the 
                claim; and
                  (iii) the agency or program under which the 
                claim arose.
    (2) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting 
agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection and at other 
times allowed by law, the head of an executive or legislative 
agency shall provide, on request of an individual alleged by 
the agency to be responsible for the claim, for a review of the 
obligation of the individual, including an opportunity for 
reconsideration of the initial decision on the claim.
    (3) Before disclosing information to a consumer reporting 
agency under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the head of an 
executive or legislative agency shall take reasonable action to 
locate an individual for whom the head of the agency does not 
have a current address to send the notice under paragraph 
(1)(C).

                  (A) the end of the 1-year period beginning on

employee of the Government entitled to bring the civil action.
    (c) The Comptroller General shall credit the appropriate 
account of the Treasury for the amount of a check or warrant

negligence of the Secretary.

arising from dual pay from the Government if the dual pay is

section 3711(a) of this title, the head of an executive or

offset. The head of the agency may collect by administrative 
offset only after giving the debtor--
          (1) written notice of the type and amount of the 
        claim, the intention of the head of the agency to 
        collect the claim by administrative offset, and an

or legislative agency must prescribe regulations on collecting 
by administrative offset based on--

        Government;
          (2) the likelihood of collecting a claim by 
        administrative offset; and
          (3) for collecting a claim by administrative offset 
        after the 6-year period for bringing a civil action on 
        a claim under section 2415 of title 28 has expired, the

        more than 6 years.

          (1) to a claim under this subchapter that has been 
        outstanding for more than 10 years; or

        claim or type of claim involved.

SEC. 3717. INTEREST AND PENALTY ON CLAIMS.

    (a)(1) The head of an executive or legislative agency shall 
charge a minimum annual rate of interest on an outstanding debt 
on a United States Government claim owed by a person that is 
equal to the average investment rate for the Treasury tax and 
loan accounts for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of 
each year, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point. The 
Secretary of the Treasury shall publish the rate before 
November 1 of that year. The rate is effective on the first day 
of the next calendar quarter.
    (2) The Secretary may change the rate of interest for a 
calendar quarter if the average investment rate for the 12-
month period ending at the close of the prior calendar quarter, 
rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, is more or less 
than the existing published rate by 2 percentage points.
    (b) Interest under subsection (a) of this section accrues 
from the date--
          (1) on which notice is mailed after October 25, 1982, 
        if notice was first mailed before October 25, 1982; or
          (2) notice of the amount due is first mailed to the 
        debtor at the most current address of the debtor 
        available to the head of the executive or legislative 
        agency, if notice is first mailed after October 24, 
        1982.
    (c) The rate of interest charged under subsection (a) of 
this section--
          (1) is the rate in effect on the date from which 
        interest begins to accrue under subsection (b) of this 
        section; and
          (2) remains fixed at that rate for the duration of 
        the indebtedness.
    (d) Interest under subsection (a) of this section may not 
be charged if the amount due on the claim is paid within 30 
days after the date from which interest accrues under 
subsection (b) of this section. The head of an executive or 
legislative agency may extend the 30-day period.
    (e) The head of an executive or legislative agency shall 
assess on a claim owed by a person--
          (1) a charge to cover the cost of processing and 
        handling a delinquent claim; and
          (2) a penalty charge of not more than 6 percent a 
        year for failure to pay a part of a debt more than 90 
        days past due.
    (f) Interest under subsection (a) of this section does not 
accrue on a charge assessed under subsection (e) of this 
section.
    (g) This section does not apply--
          (1) if a statute, regulation required by statute, 
        loan agreement, or contract prohibits charging interest 
        or assessing charges or explicitly fixes the interest 
        or charges; and
          (2) to a claim under a contract executed before 
        October 25, 1982, that is in effect on October 25, 
        1982.
    (h) In conformity with standards prescribed jointly by the 
Attorney General and the Comptroller General, the head of an 
executive or legislative agency may prescribe regulations 
identifying circumstances appropriate to waiving collection of 
interest and charges under subsections (a) and (e) of this 
section. A waiver under the regulations is deemed to be 
compliance with this section.

SEC. 3718. CONTRACTS FOR COLLECTION SERVICES.

    (a) Under conditions the head of an executive or 
legislative agency considers appropriate, the head of the 
agency may make a contract with a person for collection 
services to recover indebtedness owed the United States 
Government. The contract shall provide that--
          (1) the head of the agency retains the authority to 
        resolve a dispute, compromise a claim, end collection

        bring a civil action; and
          (2) the person is subject to--

    (b)(1)(A) The Attorney General may make contracts retaining 
private counsel to furnish legal services, including 
representation in negotiation, compromise, settlement, and 
litigation, in the case of any claim of indebtedness owed the 
United States. Each such contract shall include such terms and 
conditions as the Attorney General considers necessary and 
appropriate, including a provision specifying the amount of the 
fee to be paid to the private counsel under such contract or 
the method for calculating that fee. The amount of the fee 
payable for legal services furnished under any such contract 
may not exceed the fee that counsel engaged in the private 
practice of law in the area or areas where the legal services 
are furnished typically charge clients for furnishing legal 
services in the collection of claims of indebtedness, as 
determined by the Attorney General, considering the amount, 
age, and nature of the indebtedness and whether the debtor is 
an individual or a business entity. If the Attorney General 
makes a contract for legal services to be furnished in any 
judicial district of the United States under the first sentence 
of this paragraph, the Attorney General shall use his best 
efforts to obtain, from among attorneys regularly engaged in 
the private practice of law in such district, at least four 
such contracts for legal services with private individuals or 
firms in such district. Nothing in this subparagraph shall 
relieve the Attorney General of the competition requirements 
set forth in title III of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251 and 
following).
  (B) The Attorney General shall use his best efforts to enter 
into contracts under this paragraph with law firms owned and 
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals, so as to enable each agency to comply with 
paragraph (3).
  (2) The head of an executive or legislative agency may, 
subject to the approval of the Attorney General, refer to a 
private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of this subsection 
claims of indebtedness owed the United States arising out of 
activities of that agency.
  (3) Each agency shall use its best efforts to assure that not 
less than 10 percent of the amounts of all claims referred to 
private counsel by that agency under paragraph (2) are referred 
to law firms owned and controlled by socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals. For purposes of this paragraph--
          (A) the term ``law firm owned and controlled by 
        socially and economically disadvantaged individuals'' 
        means a law firm that meets the requirements set forth 
        in clauses (i) and (ii) of section 8(d)(3)(C) of the 
        Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)(i) and (ii)) 
        and regulations issued under those clauses; and
          (B) ``socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals'' shall be presumed to include these groups 
        and individuals described in the last paragraph of 
        section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small Business Act.
  (4) Notwithstanding sections 516, 518(b), 519, and 547(2) of 
title 28, a private counsel retained under paragraph (1) of 
this subsection may represent the United States in litigation 
in connection with legal services furnished pursuant to the 
contract entered into with that counsel under paragraph (1) of 
this subsection.
  (5) A contract made with a private counsel under paragraph 
(1) of this subsection shall include--
          (A) a provision permitting the Attorney General to 
        terminate either the contract or the private counsel's 
        representation of the United States in particular cases 
        if the Attorney General finds that such action is for 
        the convenience of the Government;
          (B) a provision stating that the head of the 
        executive or legislative agency which refers a claim 
        under the contract retains the authority to resolve a 
        dispute regarding the claim, to compromise the claim, 
        or to terminate a collection action on the claim; and
          (C) a provision requiring the private counsel to 
        transmit monthly to the Attorney General and the head 
        of the executive or legislative agency referring a 
        claim under the contract a report on the services 
        relating to the claim rendered under the contract 
        during the month and the progress made during the month 
        in collecting the claim under the contract.
  (6) Notwithstanding the fourth sentence of section 803(6) of 
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692a(6)), a 
private counsel performing legal services pursuant to a 
contract made under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be 
considered to be a debt collector for the purposes of such Act.
  (7) Any counterclaim filed in any action to recover 
indebtedness owed the United States which is brought on behalf 
of the United States by private counsel retained under this 
subsection may not be asserted unless the counterclaim is 
served directly on the Attorney General or the United States 
Attorney for the judicial district in which, or embracing the 
place in which, the action is brought. Such service shall be 
made in accordance with the rules of procedure of the court in 
which the action is brought.
  (c) The Attorney General shall transmit to the Congress an 
annual report on the activities of the Department of Justice to 
recover indebtedness owed the United States which was referred 
to the Department of Justice for collection. Each such report 
shall include a list, by agency, of--
          (1) the total number and amounts of claims which were 
        referred for legal services to the Department of 
        Justice and to private counsel under subsection (b) 
        during the 1-year period covered by the report;
          (2) the total number and amount of those claims 
        referred for legal services to the Department of 
        Justice which were collected or were not collected or 
        otherwise resolved during the 1-year period covered by 
        the report; and
          (3) the total number and amount of those claims 
        referred for legal services to private counsel under 
        subsection (b)--
                  (A) which were collected or were not 
                collected or otherwise resolved during the 1-
                year period covered by the report;
                  (B) which were not collected or otherwise 
                resolved under a contract terminated by the 
                Attorney General during the 1-year period 
                covered by the report; and
                  (C) on which the Attorney General terminated 
                the private counsel's representation during the 
                1-year period covered by the report without 
                terminating the contract with the private 
                counsel under which the claims were referred.
  (d) Notwithstanding section 3302(b) of this title, a contract 
under subsection (a) or (b) of this section may provide that a 
fee a person charges to recover indebtedness owed the United 
States Government is payable from the amount recovered.
  (e) A contract under subsection (a) or (b) of this section is 
effective only to the extent and in the amount provided in an 
appropriation law. This limitation does not apply in the case 
of a contract that authorizes a person to collect a fee as 
provided in subsection (d) of this section.
  (f) This section does not apply to the collection of debts 
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).
  (g) In order to assist Congress in determining whether use of 
private counsel is a cost-effective method of collecting 
Government debts, the Attorney General shall, following 
consultation with the General Accounting Office, maintain and 
make available to the Inspector General of the Department of 
Justice, statistical data relating to the comparative costs of 
debt collection by participating United States Attorneys' 
Offices and by private counsel.

procedures as withdrawals and deposits by electronic transfer 
of funds, automatic withdrawals from accounts at financial 
institutions, and a system under which financial institutions

the general fund caused by such noncompliance.
  (b) The head of an executive agency shall pay to the

of the lease or purchase of equipment and operating facilities.

SEC. 3720A. REDUCTION OF TAX REFUND BY AMOUNT OF DEBT.

  (a) Any Federal agency that is owed a past-due legally 
enforceable debt (other than any past-due support), including 
debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the 
Federal Government, by a named person shall, in accordance with 
regulations issued pursuant to subsections (b) and (d), notify 
the Secretary of the Treasury at least once a year of the

          (1) notifies the person incurring such debt that such 
        agency proposes to take action pursuant to such 
        paragraph with respect to such debt;
          (2) gives such person at least 60 days to present 
        evidence that all or part of such debt is not past-due 
        or not legally enforceable;
          (3) considers any evidence presented by such person 
        and determines that an amount of such debt is past due 
        and legally enforceable;
          (4) satisfies such other conditions as the Secretary 
        may prescribe to ensure that the determination made 
        under paragraph (3) with respect to such debt is valid 
        and that the agency has made reasonable efforts 
        (determined on a government-wide basis) to obtain 
        payment of such debt; and
          (5) certifies that reasonable efforts have been made 
        by the agency (pursuant to regulations) to obtain 
        payment of such debt.
  (c) Upon receiving notice from any Federal agency that a 
named person owes to such agency a past-due legally enforceable 
debt, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any 
amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such 
person. If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such 
amount is payable, he shall reduce such refunds by an amount 
equal to the amount of such debt, pay the amount of such 
reduction to such agency, and notify such agency of the 
individual's home address.
  (d) The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations 
prescribing the time or times at which agencies must submit 
notices of past-due legally enforceable debts, the manner in 
which such notices must be submitted, and the necessary 
information that must be contained in or accompany the notices. 
The regulations shall specify the minimum amount of debt to 
which the reduction procedure established by subsection (c) may 
be applied and the fee that an agency must pay to reimburse the 
Secretary of the Treasury for the full cost of applying such 
procedure. Any fee paid to the Secretary pursuant to the 
preceding sentence may be used to reimburse appropriations 
which bore all or part of the cost of applying such procedure.

the Treasury that an erroneous payment has been made to such 
agency under subsection (c) shall pay promptly to the 
Secretary, in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary 
may prescribe, an amount equal to the amount of such erroneous 
payment (without regard to whether any other amounts payable to 
such agency under such subsection have been paid to such 
agency).

overpayment made to any individual only if such individual is 
not currently entitled to monthly insurance benefits under 
title II of the Social Security Act.
  (2)(A) The requirements of subsection (b) shall not be 
treated as met in the case of the recovery of an OASDI 
overpayment from any individual under this section unless the 
notification under subsection (b)(1) describes the conditions 
under which the Commissioner of Social Security is required to 
waive recovery of an overpayment, as provided under section 
204(b) of the Social Security Act.
  (B) In any case in which an individual files for a waiver 
under section 204(b) of the Social Security Act within the 60-
day period referred to in subsection (b)(2), the Commissioner 
of Social Security shall not certify to the Secretary of the 
Treasury that the debt is valid under subsection (b)(4) before 
rendering a decision on the waiver request under such section 
204(b). In lieu of payment, pursuant to subsection (c), to the 
Commissioner of Social Security of the amount of any reduction 
under this subsection based on an OASDI overpayment, the 
Secretary of the Treasury shall deposit such amount in the 
Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the 
Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, whichever is certified 
to the Secretary of the Treasury as appropriate by the 
Commissioner of Social Security.

section shall apply only to refunds payable on or after January 
1, 1995. In the case of refunds of individuals who owe debts to 
Federal agencies that have not participated in the Federal tax 
refund offset program prior to the date of enactment of this

claimant accepts the amount of the settlement in complete 
satisfaction of the claim against the Government.

SEC. 3726. PAYMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION.

  (a) A carrier or freight forwarder presenting a bill for 
transporting an individual or property for the United States 
Government may be paid before the Administrator of General 
Services conducts an audit, in accordance with regulations that 
the Administrator shall prescribe. A claim under this section 
shall be allowed only if it is received by the Administrator 
not later than 3 years (excluding time of war) after the later 
of the following dates:
          (1) accrual of the claim;
          (2) payment for the transportation is made;
          (3) refund for an overpayment for the transportation 
        is made; or
          (4) a deduction under subsection (b) of this section 
        is made.
  (b) Not later than 3 years (excluding time of war) after the 
time a bill is paid, the Government may deduct from an amount 
subsequently due a carrier or freight forwarder an amount paid 
on the bill that was greater than the rate allowed under--
          (1) a lawful tariff on file with the Interstate 
        Commerce Commission, the Secretary of Transportation 
        with respect to foreign air transportation (as defined 
        in section 40102(a) of title 49), the Federal Maritime 
        Commission, or a State transportation authority; or
          (2) sections 10721-10724 of title 49 or an equivalent 
        arrangement or an exemption.
  (c) Expenses of transportation audit postpayment contracts 
and contract administration, and the expenses of all other 
transportation audit and audit-related functions conferred upon 
the Administrator of General Services, shall be financed from 
overpayments collected from carriers on transportation bills 
paid by the Government and other similar type refunds, not to 
exceed collections. Payment to any contractor for audit 
services shall not exceed 50 percent of the overpayment 
identified by contract audit.
  (d) At least annually, and as determined by the 
Administrator, after making adequate provision for expense of 
refunds to carriers, transportation audit postpayment 
contracts, contract administration, and other expenses 
authorized in subsection (c), overpayments collected by the 
General Services Administration shall be transferred to 
miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury. A report of receipts, 
disbursements, and transfers (to miscellaneous receipts) 
pursuant to this section shall be made annually in connection 
with the budget estimates to the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget and to the Congress.
  (e) The Administrator may delegate any authority conferred by 
this section to another agency or agencies if the Administrator 
determines that such a delegation would be cost-effective or 
otherwise in the public interest.
  (f) Under regulations the head of an agency prescribes that 
conform with standards the Secretary of the Treasury and the 
Comptroller General prescribe jointly, a bill under this 
section may be paid before the transportation is completed 
notwithstanding section 3324 of this title when a carrier or 
freight forwarder issues the usual document for the 
transportation. Payment for transportation ordered but not 
provided may be recovered by deduction or other means.
  (g)(1) A carrier or freight forwarder may request the 
Comptroller General to review the action of the Administrator 
if the request is received not later than 6 months (excluding 
time of war) after the Administrator acts or within the time 
stated in subsection (a) of this section, whichever is later.
  (2) This section does not prevent the Comptroller General 
from conducting an audit under chapter 35 of this title.

SEC. 3727. ASSIGNMENTS OF CLAIMS.

  (a) In this section, ``assignment'' means--
          (1) a transfer or assignment of any part of a claim 
        against the United States Government or of an interest 
        in the claim; or
          (2) the authorization to receive payment for any part 
        of the claim.
  (b) An assignment may be made only after a claim is allowed, 
the amount of the claim is decided, and a warrant for payment 
of the claim has been issued. The assignment shall specify the 
warrant, must be made freely, and must be attested to by 2 
witnesses. The person making the assignment shall acknowledge 
it before an official who may acknowledge a deed, and the 
official shall certify the assignment. The certificate shall 
state that the official completely explained the assignment 
when it was acknowledged. An assignment under this subsection 
is valid for any purpose.
  (c) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to an 
assignment to a financing institution of money due or to become 
due under a contract providing for payments totaling at least 
$1,000 when--
          (1) the contract does not forbid an assignment;
          (2) unless the contract expressly provides otherwise, 
        the assignment--
                  (A) is for the entire amount not already 
                paid;
                  (B) is made to only one party, except that it 
                may be made to a party as agent or trustee for 
                more than one party participating in the 
                financing; and
                  (C) may not be reassigned; and
          (3) the assignee files a written notice of the 
        assignment and a copy of the assignment with the 
        contracting official or the head of the agency, the 
        surety on a bond on the contract, and any disbursing 
        official for the contract.
  (d) During a war or national emergency proclaimed by the 
President or declared by law and ended by proclamation or law, 
a contract with the Department of Defense, the General Services 
Administration, the Department of Energy (when carrying out 
duties and powers formerly carried out by the Atomic Energy 
Commission), or other agency the President designates may 
provide, or may be changed without consideration to provide, 
that a future payment under the contract to an assignee is not 
subject to reduction or setoff. A payment subsequently due 
under the contract (even after the war or emergency is ended) 
shall be paid to the assignee without a reduction or setoff for 
liability of the assignor--
          (1) to the Government independent of the contract; or
          (2) because of renegotiation, fine, penalty (except 
        an amount that may be collected or withheld under, or 
        because the assignor does not comply with, the 
        contract), taxes, social security contributions, or 
        withholding or failing to withhold taxes or social 
        security contributions, arising from, or independent 
        of, the contract.
  (e)(1) An assignee under this section does not have to make 
restitution of, refund, or repay the amount received because of 
the liability of the assignor to the Government that arises 
from or is independent of the contract.
  (2) The Government may not collect or reclaim money paid to a 
person receiving an amount under an assignment or allotment of 
pay or allowances authorized by law when liability may exist 
because of the death of the person making the assignment or 
allotment.

SEC. 3728. SETOFF AGAINST JUDGMENT.

  (a) The Comptroller General shall withhold paying that part 
of a judgment against the United States Government presented to 
the Comptroller General that is equal to a debt the plaintiff 
owes the Government.
    (b) The Comptroller General shall--
          (1) discharge the debt if the plaintiff agrees to the 
        setoff and discharges a part of the judgment equal to 
        the debt; or
          (2)(A) withhold payment of an additional amount the 
        Comptroller General decides will cover legal costs of 
        bringing a civil action for the debt if the plaintiff 
        denies the debt or does not agree to the setoff; and
          (B) have a civil action brought if one has not 
        already been brought.
  (c) If the Government loses a civil action to recover a debt 
or recovers less than the amount the Comptroller General 
withholds under this section, the Comptroller General shall pay 
the plaintiff the balance and interest of 6 percent for the 
time the money is withheld.

SEC. 3729. FALSE CLAIMS.

  (a) Liability for Certain Acts.--Any person who--
          (1) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to 
        an officer or employee of the United States Government 
        or a member of the Armed Forces of the United States a 
        false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;
          (2) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or 
        used, a false record or statement to get a false or 
        fraudulent claim paid or approved by the Government;
          (3) conspires to defraud the Government by getting a 
        false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid;
          (4) has possession, custody, or control of property 
        or money used, or to be used, by the Government and, 
        intending to defraud the Government or willfully to 
        conceal the property, delivers, or causes to be 
        delivered, less property than the amount for which the 
        person receives a certificate or receipt;
          (5) authorized to make or deliver a document 
        certifying receipt of property used, or to be used, by 
        the Government and, intending to defraud the 
        Government, makes or delivers the receipt without 
        completely knowing that the information on the receipt 
        is true;
          (6) knowingly buys, or receives as a pledge of an 
        obligation or debt, public property from an officer or 
        employee of the Government, or a member of the Armed 
        Forces, who lawfully may not sell or pledge the 
        property; or
          (7) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or 
        used, a false record or statement to conceal, avoid, or 
        decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or 
        property to the Government, is liable to the United 
        States Government for a civil penalty of not less than 
        $5,000 and not more than $10,000, plus 3 times the 
        amount of damages which the Government sustains because 
        of the act of that person, except that if the court 
        finds that--
                  (A) the person committing the violation of 
                this subsection furnished officials of the 
                United States responsible for investigating 
                false claims violations with all information 
                known to such person about the violation within 
                30 days after the date on which the defendant 
                first obtained the information;
                  (B) such person fully cooperated with any 
                Government investigation of such violation; and
                  (C) at the time such person furnished the 
                United States with the information about the 
                violation, no criminal prosecution, civil 
                action, or administrative action had commenced 
                under this title with respect to such 
                violation, and the person did not have actual 
                knowledge of the existence of an investigation 
                into such violation;
the court may assess not less than 2 times the amount of 
damages which the Government sustains because of the act of the 
person. A person violating this subsection shall also be liable 
to the United States Government for the costs of a civil action 
brought to recover any such penalty or damages.
  (b) Knowing and Knowingly Defined.--For purposes of this 
section, the terms ``knowing'' and ``knowingly'' mean that a 
person, with respect to information--
          (1) has actual knowledge of the information;
          (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or 
        falsity of the information; or
          (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or 
        falsity of the information,
and no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.
  (c) Claim Defined.--For purposes of this section, ``claim'' 
includes any request or demand, whether under a contract or 
otherwise, for money or property which is made to a contractor, 
grantee, or other recipient if the United States Government 
provides any portion of the money or property which is 
requested or demanded, or if the Government will reimburse such 
contractor, grantee, or other recipient for any portion of the 
money or property which is requested or demanded.
  (d) Exemption From Disclosure.--Any information furnished 
pursuant to subparagraphs (A) through (C) of subsection (a) 
shall be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5.
  (e) Exclusion.--This section does not apply to claims, 
records, or statements made under the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986.

SEC. 3730. CIVIL ACTIONS FOR FALSE CLAIMS.

  (a) Responsibilities of the Attorney General.--The Attorney 
General diligently shall investigate a violation under section 
3729. If the Attorney General finds that a person has violated 
or is violating section 3729, the Attorney General may bring a 
civil action under this section against the person.
  (b) Actions by Private Persons.--
          (1) A person may bring a civil action for a violation 
        of section 3729 for the person and for the United 
        States Government. The action shall be brought in the 
        name of the Government. The action may be dismissed 
        only if the court and the Attorney General give written 
        consent to the dismissal and their reasons for 
        consenting.
          (2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of 
        substantially all material evidence and information the 
        person possesses shall be served on the Government 
        pursuant to Rule 4(d)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
        Procedure. The complaint shall be filed in camera, 
        shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall 
        not be served on the defendant until the court so 
        orders. The Government may elect to intervene and 
        proceed with the action within 60 days after it 
        receives both the complaint and the material evidence 
        and information.
          (3) The Government may, for good cause shown, move 
        the court for extensions of the time during which the 
        complaint remains under seal under paragraph (2). Any 
        such motions may be supported by affidavits or other 
        submissions in camera. The defendant shall not be 
        required to respond to any complaint filed under this 
        section until 20 days after the complaint is unsealed 
        and served upon the defendant pursuant to Rule 4 of the 
        Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
          (4) Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any 
        extensions obtained under paragraph (3), the Government 
        shall--
                  (A) proceed with the action, in which case 
                the action shall be conducted by the 
                Government; or
                  (B) notify the court that it declines to take 
                over the action, in which case the person 
                bringing the action shall have the right to 
                conduct the action.
          (5) When a person brings an action under this 
        subsection, no person other than the Government may 
        intervene or bring a related action based on the facts 
        underlying the pending action.
  (c) Rights of the Parties to Qui Tam Actions.--
          (1) If the Government proceeds with the action, it 
        shall have the primary responsibility for prosecuting 
        the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the 
        person bringing the action. Such person shall have the 
        right to continue as a party to the action, subject to 
        the limitations set forth in paragraph (2).
          (2)(A) The Government may dismiss the action 
        notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating 
        the action if the person has been notified by the 
        Government of the filing of the motion and the court 
        has provided the person with an opportunity for a 
        hearing on the motion.
          (B) The Government may settle the action with the 
        defendant notwithstanding the objections of the person 
        initiating the action if the court determines, after a 
        hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, 
        adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. 
        Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held 
        in camera.
          (C) Upon a showing by the Government that 
        unrestricted participation during the course of the 
        litigation by the person initiating the action would 
        interfere with or unduly delay the Government's 
        prosecution of the case, or would be repetitious, 
        irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court 
        may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the 
        person's participation, such as--
                  (i) limiting the number of witnesses the 
                person may call;
                  (ii) limiting the length of the testimony of 
                such witnesses;
                  (iii) limiting the person's cross-examination 
                of witnesses; or
                  (iv) otherwise limiting the participation by 
                the person in the litigation.
          (D) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted 
        participation during the course of the litigation by 
        the person initiating the action would be for purposes 
        of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden 
        or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the 
        participation by the person in the litigation.
          (3) If the Government elects not to proceed with the 
        action, the person who initiated the action shall have 
        the right to conduct the action. If the Government so 
        requests, it shall be served with copies of all 
        pleadings filed in the action and shall be supplied 
        with copies of all deposition transcripts (at the 
        Government's expense). When a person proceeds with the 
        action, the court, without limiting the status and 
        rights of the person initiating the action, may 
        nevertheless permit the Government to intervene at a 
        later date upon a showing of good cause.
          (4) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the 
        action, upon a showing by the Government that certain 
        actions of discovery by the person initiating the 
        action would interfere with the Government's 
        investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil 
        matter arising out of the same facts, the court may 
        stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 
        days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The 
        court may extend the 60-day period upon a further 
        showing in camera that the Government has pursued the 
        criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with 
        reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the 
        civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal 
        or civil investigation or proceedings.
          (5) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Government 
        may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate 
        remedy available to the Government, including any 
        administrative proceeding to determine a civil money 
        penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in 
        another proceeding, the person initiating the action 
        shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such 
        person would have had if the action had continued under 
        this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law 
        made in such other proceeding that has become final 
        shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under 
        this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a 
        finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally 
        determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the 
        United States, if all time for filing such an appeal 
        with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, 
        or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to 
        judicial review.
    (d) Award to Qui Tam Plaintiff.--
          (1) If the Government proceeds with an action brought 
        by a person under subsection (b), such person shall, 
        subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, 
        receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 
        percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of 
        the claim, depending upon the extent to which the 
        person substantially contributed to the prosecution of 
        the action. Where the action is one which the court 
        finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific 
        information (other than information provided by the 
        person bringing the action) relating to allegations or 
        transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative 
        hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or 
        Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or 
        investigation, or from the news media, the court may 
        award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no 
        case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into 
        account the significance of the information and the 
        role of the person bringing the action in advancing the 
        case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the 
        first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be 
        made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also 
        receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the 
        court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus 
        reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. All such 
        expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the 
        defendant.
          (2) If the Government does not proceed with an action 
        under this section, the person bringing the action or 
        settling the claim shall receive an amount which the 
        court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil 
        penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than 
        25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds 
        of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of 
        such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount 
        for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have 
        been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys' 
        fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs 
        shall be awarded against the defendant.
          (3) Whether or not the Government proceeds with the 
        action, if the court finds that the action was brought 
        by a person who planned and initiated the violation of 
        section 3729 upon which the action was brought, then 
        the court may, to the extent the court considers 
        appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the 
        action which the person would otherwise receive under 
        paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into 
        account the role of that person in advancing the case 
        to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining 
        to the violation. If the person bringing the action is 
        convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her 
        role in the violation of section 3729, that person 
        shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not 
        receive any share of the proceeds of the action. Such 
        dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the United 
        States to continue the action, represented by the 
        Department of Justice.
          (4) If the Government does not proceed with the 
        action and the person bringing the action conducts the 
        action, the court may award to the defendant its 
        reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the 
        defendant prevails in the action and the court finds 
        that the claim of the person bringing the action was 
        clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought 
        primarily for purposes of harassment.
    (e) Certain Actions Barred.--
          (1) No court shall have jurisdiction over an action 
        brought by a former or present member of the armed 
        forces under subsection (b) of this section against a 
        member of the armed forces arising out of such person's 
        service in the armed forces.
          (2)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an 
        action brought under subsection (b) against a Member of 
        Congress, a member of the judiciary, or a senior 
        executive branch official if the action is based on 
        evidence or information known to the Government when 
        the action was brought.

          (3) In no event may a person bring an action under

        transactions which are the subject of a civil suit or 
        an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in 
        which the Government is already a party.
          (4)(A) No court shall have jurisdiction over an 
        action under this section based upon the public 
        disclosure of allegations or transactions in a 
        criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a 
        congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting 
        Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or 
        from the news media, unless the action is brought by 
        the Attorney General or the person bringing the action 
        is an original source of the information.
          (B) For purposes of this paragraph, ``original 
        source'' means an individual who has direct and 
        independent knowledge of the information on which the 
        allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the

threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated 
against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her 
employer because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf 
of the employee or others in furtherance of an action under 
this section, including investigation for, initiation of, 
testimony for, or assistance in an action filed or to be filed 
under this section, shall be entitled to all relief necessary 
to make the employee whole. Such relief shall include 
reinstatement with the same seniority status such employee 
would have had but for the discrimination, 2 times the amount 
of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any 
special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, 
including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. An 
employee may bring an action in the appropriate district court

subsection.

          (1) more than 6 years after the date on which the 
        violation of section 3729 is committed, or
          (2) more than 3 years after the date when facts 
        material to the right of action are known or reasonably 
        should have been known by the official of the United 
        States charged with responsibility to act in the 
        circumstances, but in no event more than 10 years after 
        the date on which the violation is committed, whichever 
        occurs last.

Rules of Criminal Procedure, or the Federal Rules of Evidence, 
a final judgment rendered in favor of the United States in any 
criminal proceeding charging fraud or false statements, whether 
upon a verdict after trial or upon a plea of guilty or nolo 
contendere, shall estop the defendant from denying the 
essential elements of the offense in any action which involves 
the same transaction as in the criminal proceeding and which is 
brought under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3730.

SEC. 3732. FALSE CLAIMS JURISDICTION.

which any act proscribed by section 3729 occurred. A summons as 
required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be 
issued by the appropriate district court and served at any 
place within or outside the United States.
  (b) Claims Under State Law.--The district courts shall have 
jurisdiction over any action brought under the laws of any 
State for the recovery of funds paid by a State or local

SEC. 3733. CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS.

  (a) In General.--
          (1) Issuance and service.--Whenever the Attorney 
        General has reason to believe that any person may be in 
        possession, custody, or control of any documentary 
        material or information relevant to a false claims law 
        investigation, the Attorney General may, before 
        commencing a civil proceeding under section 3730 or 
        other false claims law, issue in writing and cause to 
        be served upon such person, a civil investigative 
        demand requiring such person--
                  (A) to produce such documentary material for 
                inspection and copying,
                  (B) to answer in writing written 
                interrogatories with respect to such 
                documentary material or information,
                  (C) to give oral testimony concerning such 
                documentary material or information, or
                  (D) to furnish any combination of such 
                material, answers, or testimony.
        The Attorney General may not delegate the authority to 
        issue civil investigative demands under this 
        subsection. Whenever a civil investigative demand is an 
        express demand for any product of discovery, the 
        Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an 
        Assistant Attorney General shall cause to be served, in 
        any manner authorized by this section, a copy of such 
        demand upon the person from whom the discovery was 
        obtained and shall notify the person to whom such 
        demand is issued of the date on which such copy was 
        served.
          (2) Contents and deadlines.--
                  (A) Each civil investigative demand issued 
                under paragraph (1) shall state the nature of 
                the conduct constituting the alleged violation 
                of a false claims law which is under 
                investigation, and the applicable provision of 
                law alleged to be violated.
                  (B) If such demand is for the production of 
                documentary material, the demand shall--
                          (i) describe each class of 
                        documentary material to be produced 
                        with such definiteness and certainty as 
                        to permit such material to be fairly 
                        identified;
                          (ii) prescribe a return date for each 
                        such class which will provide a 
                        reasonable period of time within which 
                        the material so demanded may be 
                        assembled and made available for 
                        inspection and copying; and
                          (iii) identify the false claims law 
                        investigator to whom such material 
                        shall be made available.
                  (C) If such demand is for answers to written 
                interrogatories, the demand shall--
                          (i) set forth with specificity the 
                        written interrogatories to be answered;
                          (ii) prescribe dates at which time 
                        answers to written interrogatories 
                        shall be submitted; and
                          (iii) identify the false claims law 
                        investigator to whom such answers shall 
                        be submitted.
                  (D) If such demand is for the giving of oral 
                testimony, the demand shall--
                          (i) prescribe a date, time, and place 
                        at which oral testimony shall be 
                        commenced;
                          (ii) identify a false claims law 
                        investigator who shall conduct the 
                        examination and the custodian to whom 
                        the transcript of such examination 
                        shall be submitted;
                          (iii) specify that such attendance 
                        and testimony are necessary to the 
                        conduct of the investigation;
                          (iv) notify the person receiving the 
                        demand of the right to be accompanied 
                        by an attorney and any other 
                        representative; and
                          (v) describe the general purpose for 
                        which the demand is being issued and 
                        the general nature of the testimony, 
                        including the primary areas of inquiry, 
                        which will be taken pursuant to the 
                        demand.
                  (E) Any civil investigative demand issued 
                under this section which is an express demand 
                for any product of discovery shall not be 
                returned or returnable until 20 days after a 
                copy of such demand has been served upon the 
                person from whom the discovery was obtained.
                  (F) The date prescribed for the commencement 
                of oral testimony pursuant to a civil 
                investigative demand issued under this section 
                shall be a date which is not less than seven 
                days after the date on which demand is 
                received, unless the Attorney General or an 
                Assistant Attorney General designated by the 
                Attorney General determines that exceptional 
                circumstances are present which warrant the 
                commencement of such testimony within a lesser 
                period of time.
                  (G) The Attorney General shall not authorize 
                the issuance under this section of more than 
                one civil investigative demand for oral 
                testimony by the same person unless the person 
                requests otherwise or unless the Attorney 
                General, after investigation, notifies that 
                person in writing that an additional demand for 
                oral testimony is necessary. The Attorney 
                General may not, notwithstanding section 510 of 
                title 28, authorize the performance, by any 
                other officer, employee, or agency, of any 
                function vested in the Attorney General under 
                this subparagraph.
  (b) Protected Material or Information.--
          (1) In general.--A civil investigative demand issued 
        under subsection (a) may not require the production of 
        any documentary material, the submission of any answers 
        to written interrogatories, or the giving of any oral 
        testimony if such material, answers, or testimony would 
        be protected from disclosure under--
                  (A) the standards applicable to subpoenas or 
                subpoenas duces tecum issued by a court of the 
                United States to aid in a grand jury 
                investigation; or
                  (B) the standards applicable to discovery 
                requests under the Federal Rules of Civil 
                Procedure, to the extent that the application 
                of such standards to any such demand is 
                appropriate and consistent with the provisions 
                and purposes of this section.
          (2) Effect on other orders, rules, and laws.--Any 
        such demand which is an express demand for any product 
        of discovery supersedes any inconsistent order, rule, 
        or provision of law (other than this section) 
        preventing or restraining disclosure of such product of 
        discovery to any person. Disclosure of any product of 
        discovery pursuant to any such express demand does not 
        constitute a waiver of any right or privilege which the 
        person making such disclosure may be entitled to invoke 
        to resist discovery of trial preparation materials.
  (c) Service; Jurisdiction.--
          (1) By whom served.--Any civil investigative demand 
        issued under subsection (a) may be served by a false 
        claims law investigator, or by a United States marshal 
        or a deputy marshal, at any place within the 
        territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United 
        States.
          (2) Service in foreign countries.--Any such demand or 
        any petition filed under subsection (j) may be served 
        upon any person who is not found within the territorial 
        jurisdiction of any court of the United States in such 
        manner as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
        prescribe for service in a foreign country. To the 
        extent that the courts of the United States can assert 
        jurisdiction over any such person consistent with due 
        process, the United States District Court for the 
        District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction 
        to take any action respecting compliance with the 
        section by any such person that such court would have 
        if such person were personally within the jurisdiction 
        of such court.
  (d) Service Upon Legal Entities and Natural Persons.--
          (1) Legal entities.--Service of any civil 
        investigative demand issued under subsection (a) or of 
        any petition filed under subsection (j) may be made 
        upon a partnership, corporation, association, or other 
        legal entity by--
                  (A) delivering an executed copy of such 
                demand or petition to any partner, executive 
                officer, managing agent, or general agent of 
                the partnership, corporation, association, or 
                entity, or to any agent authorized by 
                appointment or by law to receive service of 
                process on behalf of such partnership, 
                corporation, association, or entity;
                  (B) delivering an executed copy of such 
                demand or petition to the principal office or 
                place of business of the partnership, 
                corporation, association, or entity; or
                  (C) depositing an executed copy of such 
                demand or petition in the United States mails 
                by registered or certified mail, with a return 
                receipt requested, addressed to such 
                partnership, corporation, association, or 
                entity at its principal office or place of 
                business.
          (2) Natural persons.--Service of any such demand or 
        petition may be made upon any natural person by--
                  (A) delivering an executed copy of such 
                demand or petition to the person; or
                  (B) depositing an executed copy of such 
                demand or petition in the United States mails 
                by registered or certified mail, with a return 
                receipt requested, addressed to the person at 
                the person's residence or principal office or 
                place of business.
  (e) Proof of Service.--A verified return by the individual 
serving any civil investigative demand issued under subsection 
(a) or any petition filed under subsection (j) setting forth 
the manner of such service shall be proof of such service. In 
the case of service by registered or certified mail, such 
return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt 
of delivery of such demand.
  (f) Documentary Material.--
          (1) Sworn certificates.--The production of 
        documentary material in response to a civil 
        investigative demand served under this section shall be 
        made under a sworn certificate, in such form as the 
        demand designates, by--
                  (A) in the case of a natural person, the 
                person to whom the demand is directed, or
                  (B) in the case of a person other than a 
                natural person, a person having knowledge of 
                the facts and circumstances relating to such 
                production and authorized to act on behalf of 
                such person.
        The certificate shall state that all of the documentary 
        material required by the demand and in the possession, 
        custody, or control of the person to whom the demand is 
        directed has been produced and made available to the 
        false claims law investigator identified in the demand.
          (2) Production of materials.--Any person upon whom 
        any civil investigative demand for the production of 
        documentary material has been served under this section 
        shall make such material available for inspection and 
        copying to the false claims law investigator identified 
        in such demand at the principal place of business of 
        such person, or at such other place as the false claims 
        law investigator and the person thereafter may agree 
        and prescribe in writing, or as the court may direct 
        under subsection (j)(1). Such material shall be made so 
        available on the return date specified in such demand, 
        or on such later date as the false claims law 
        investigator may prescribe in writing. Such person may, 
        upon written agreement between the person and the false 
        claims law investigator, substitute copies for 
        originals of all or any part of such material.
  (g) Interrogatories.--Each interrogatory in a civil 
investigative demand served under this section shall be 
answered separately and fully in writing under oath and shall 
be submitted under a sworn certificate, in such form as the 
demand designates, by--
          (1) in the case of a natural person, the person to 
        whom the demand is directed, or
          (2) in the case of a person other than a natural 
        person, the person or persons responsible for answering 
        each interrogatory. If any interrogatory is objected 
        to, the reasons for the objection shall be stated in 
        the certificate instead of an answer. The certificate 
        shall state that all information required by the demand 
        and in the possession, custody, control, or knowledge 
        of the person to whom the demand is directed has been 
        submitted. To the extent that any information is not 
        furnished, the information shall be identified and 
        reasons set forth with particularity regarding the 
        reasons why the information was not furnished.
  (h) Oral Examinations.--
          (1) Procedures.--The examination of any person 
        pursuant to a civil investigative demand for oral 
        testimony served under this section shall be taken 
        before an officer authorized to administer oaths and 
        affirmations by the laws of the United States or of the 
        place where the examination is held. The officer before 
        whom the testimony is to be taken shall put the witness 
        on oath or affirmation and shall, personally or by 
        someone acting under the direction of the officer and 
        in the officer's presence, record the testimony of the 
        witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically 
        and shall be transcribed. When the testimony is fully 
        transcribed, the officer before whom the testimony is 
        taken shall promptly transmit a copy of the transcript 
        of the testimony to the custodian. This subsection 
        shall not preclude the taking of testimony by any means 
        authorized by, and in a manner consistent with, the 
        Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
          (2) Persons present.--The false claims law 
        investigator conducting the examination shall exclude 
        from the place where the examination is held all 
        persons except the person giving the testimony, the 
        attorney for and any other representative of the person 
        giving the testimony, the attorney for the Government, 
        any person who may be agreed upon by the attorney for 
        the Government and the person giving the testimony, the 
        officer before whom the testimony is to be taken, and 
        any stenographer taking such testimony.
          (3) Where testimony taken.--The oral testimony of any 
        person taken pursuant to a civil investigative demand 
        served under this section shall be taken in the 
        judicial district of the United States within which 
        such person resides, is found, or transacts business, 
        or in such other place as may be agreed upon by the 
        false claims law investigator conducting the 
        examination and such person.
          (4) Transcript of testimony.--When the testimony is 
        fully transcribed, the false claims law investigator or 
        the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall 
        afford the witness, who may be accompanied by counsel, 
        a reasonable opportunity to examine and read the 
        transcript, unless such examination and reading are 
        waived by the witness. Any changes in form or substance 
        which the witness desires to make shall be entered and 
        identified upon the transcript by the officer or the 
        false claims law investigator, with a statement of the 
        reasons given by the witness for making such changes. 
        The transcript shall then be signed by the witness, 
        unless the witness in writing waives the signing, is 
        ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the 
        transcript is not signed by the witness within 30 days 
        after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to 
        examine it, the officer or the false claims law 
        investigator shall sign it and state on the record the 
        fact of the waiver, illness, absence of the witness, or 
        the refusal to sign, together with the reasons, if any, 
        given therefor.
          (5) Certification and delivery to custodian.--The 
        officer before whom the testimony is taken shall 
        certify on the transcript that the witness was sworn by 
        the officer and that the transcript is a true record of 
        the testimony given by the witness, and the officer or 
        false claims law investigator shall promptly deliver 
        the transcript, or send the transcript by registered or 
        certified mail, to the custodian.
          (6) Furnishing or inspection of transcript by 
        witness.--Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, 
        the false claims law investigator shall furnish a copy 
        of the transcript to the witness only, except that the 
        Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or an 
        Assistant Attorney General may, for good cause, limit 
        such witness to inspection of the official transcript 
        of the witness' testimony.
          (7) Conduct of oral testimony.--
                  (A) Any person compelled to appear for oral 
                testimony under a civil investigative demand 
                issued under subsection (a) may be accompanied, 
                represented, and advised by counsel. Counsel 
                may advise such person, in confidence, with 
                respect to any question asked of such person. 
                Such person or counsel may object on the record 
                to any question, in whole or in part, and shall 
                briefly state for the record the reason for the 
                objection. An objection may be made, received, 
                and entered upon the record when it is claimed 
                that such person is entitled to refuse to 
                answer the question on the grounds of any 
                constitutional or other legal right or 
                privilege, including the privilege against 
                self-incrimination. Such person may not 
                otherwise object to or refuse to answer any 
                question, and may not directly or through 
                counsel otherwise interrupt the oral 
                examination. If such person refuses to answer 
                any question, a petition may be filed in the 
                district court of the United States under 
                subsection (j)(1) for an order compelling such 
                person to answer such question.
                  (B) If such person refuses to answer any 
                question on the grounds of the privilege 
                against self-incrimination, the testimony of 
                such person may be compelled in accordance with 
                the provisions of part V of title 18.
          (8) Witness fees and allowances.--Any person 
        appearing for oral testimony under a civil 
        investigative demand issued under subsection (a) shall 
        be entitled to the same fees and allowances which are 
        paid to witnesses in the district courts of the United 
        States.
  (i) Custodians of Documents, Answers, and Transcripts.--
          (1) Designation.--The Attorney General shall 
        designate a false claims law investigator to serve as 
        custodian of documentary material, answers to 
        interrogatories, and transcripts of oral testimony 
        received under this section, and shall designate such 
        additional false claims law investigators as the 
        Attorney General determines from time to time to be 
        necessary to serve as deputies to the custodian.
          (2) Responsibility for materials; disclosure.--
                  (A) A false claims law investigator who 
                receives any documentary material, answers to 
                interrogatories, or transcripts of oral 
                testimony under this section shall transmit 
                them to the custodian. The custodian shall take 
                physical possession of such material, answers, 
                or transcripts and shall be responsible for the 
                use made of them and for the return of 
                documentary material under paragraph (4).
                  (B) The custodian may cause the preparation 
                of such copies of such documentary material, 
                answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of 
                oral testimony as may be required for official 
                use by any false claims law investigator, or 
                other officer or employee of the Department of 
                Justice, who is authorized for such use under 
                regulations which the Attorney General shall 
                issue. Such material, answers, and transcripts 
                may be used by any such authorized false claims 
                law investigator or other officer or employee 
                in connection with the taking of oral testimony 
                under this section.
                  (C) Except as otherwise provided in this 
                subsection, no documentary material, answers to 
                interrogatories, or transcripts of oral 
                testimony, or copies thereof, while in the 
                possession of the custodian, shall be available 
                for examination by any individual other than a 
                false claims law investigator or other officer 
                or employee of the Department of Justice 
                authorized under subparagraph (B). The 
                prohibition in the preceding sentence on the 
                availability of material, answers, or 
                transcripts shall not apply if consent is given 
                by the person who produced such material, 
                answers, or transcripts, or, in the case of any 
                product of discovery produced pursuant to an 
                express demand for such material, consent is 
                given by the person from whom the discovery was 
                obtained. Nothing in this subparagraph is 
                intended to prevent disclosure to the Congress, 
                including any committee or subcommittee of the 
                Congress, or to any other agency of the United 
                States for use by such agency in furtherance of 
                its statutory responsibilities. Disclosure of 
                information to any such other agency shall be 
                allowed only upon application, made by the 
                Attorney General to a United States district 
                court, showing substantial need for the use of 
                the information by such agency in furtherance 
                of its statutory responsibilities.
                  (D) While in the possession of the custodian 
                and under such reasonable terms and conditions 
                as the Attorney General shall prescribe--
                          (i) documentary material and answers 
                        to interrogatories shall be available 
                        for examination by the person who 
                        produced such material or answers, or 
                        by a representative of that person 
                        authorized by that person to examine 
                        such material and answers; and
                          (ii) transcripts of oral testimony 
                        shall be available for examination by 
                        the person who produced such testimony, 
                        or by a representative of that person 
                        authorized by that person to examine 
                        such transcripts.
          (3) Use of material, answers, or transcripts in other 
        proceedings.--Whenever any attorney of the Department 
        of Justice has been designated to appear before any 
        court, grand jury, or Federal agency in any case or 
        proceeding, the custodian of any documentary material, 
        answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral 
        testimony received under this section may deliver to 
        such attorney such material, answers, or transcripts 
        for official use in connection with any such case or 
        proceeding as such attorney determines to be required. 
        Upon the completion of any such case or proceeding, 
        such attorney shall return to the custodian any such 
        material, answers, or transcripts so delivered which 
        have not passed into the control of such court, grand 
        jury, or agency through introduction into the record of 
        such case or proceeding.
          (4) Conditions for return of material.--If any 
        documentary material has been produced by any person in 
        the course of any false claims law investigation 
        pursuant to a civil investigative demand under this 
        section, and--
                  (A) any case or proceeding before the court 
                or grand jury arising out of such 
                investigation, or any proceeding before any 
                Federal agency involving such material, has 
                been completed, or
                  (B) no case or proceeding in which such 
                material may be used has been commenced within 
                a reasonable time after completion of the 
                examination and analysis of all documentary 
                material and other information assembled in the 
                course of such investigation the custodian 
                shall, upon written request of the person who 
                produced such material, return to such person 
                any such material (other than copies furnished 
                to the false claims law investigator under 
                subsection (f)(2) or made for the Department of 
                Justice under paragraph (2)(B) which has not 
                passed into the control of any court, grand 
                jury, or agency through introduction into the 
                record of such case or proceeding.
          (5) Appointment of successor custodians.--In the 
        event of the death, disability, or separation from 
        service in the Department of Justice of the custodian 
        of any documentary material, answers to 
        interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony 
        produced pursuant to a civil investigative demand under 
        this section, or in the event of the official relief of 
        such custodian from responsibility for the custody and 
        control of such material, answers, or transcripts, the 
        Attorney General shall promptly--
                  (A) designate another false claims law 
                investigator to serve as custodian of such 
                material, answers, or transcripts, and
                  (B) transmit in writing to the person who 
                produced such material, answers, or testimony 
                notice of the identity and address of the 
                successor so designated.
        Any person who is designated to be a successor under 
        this paragraph shall have, with regard to such 
        material, answers, or transcripts, the same duties and 
        responsibilities as were imposed by this section upon 
        that person's predecessor in office, except that the 
        successor shall not be held responsible for any default 
        or dereliction which occurred before that designation.
  (j) Judicial Proceedings.--
          (1) Petition for enforcement.--Whenever any person 
        fails to comply with any civil investigative demand 
        issued under subsection (a), or whenever satisfactory 
        copying or reproduction of any material requested in 
        such demand cannot be done and such person refuses to 
        surrender such material, the Attorney General may file, 
        in the district court of the United States for any 
        judicial district in which such person resides, is 
        found, or transacts business, and serve upon such 
        person a petition for an order of such court for the 
        enforcement of the civil investigative demand.
          (2) Petition to modify or set aside demand.--
                  (A) Any person who has received a civil 
                investigative demand issued under subsection 
                (a) may file, in the district court of the 
                United States for the judicial district within 
                which such person resides, is found, or 
                transacts business, and serve upon the false 
                claims law investigator identified in such 
                demand a petition for an order of the court to 
                modify or set aside such demand. In the case of 
                a petition addressed to an express demand for 
                any product of discovery, a petition to modify 
                or set aside such demand may be brought only in 
                the district court of the United States for the 
                judicial district in which the proceeding in 
                which such discovery was obtained is or was 
                last pending. Any petition under this 
                subparagraph must be filed--
                          (i) within 20 days after the date of 
                        service of the civil investigative 
                        demand, or at any time before the 
                        return date specified in the demand, 
                        whichever date is earlier, or
                          (ii) within such longer period as may 
                        be prescribed in writing by any false 
                        claims law investigator identified in 
                        the demand.
                  (B) The petition shall specify each ground 
                upon which the petitioner relies in seeking 
                relief under subparagraph (A), and may be based 
                upon any failure of the demand to comply with 
                the provisions of this section or upon any 
                constitutional or other legal right or 
                privilege of such person. During the pendency 
                of the petition in the court, the court may 
                stay, as it deems proper, the running of the 
                time allowed for compliance with the demand, in 
                whole or in part, except that the person filing 
                the petition shall comply with any portions of 
                the demand not sought to be modified or set 
                aside.
          (3) Petition to modify or set aside demand for 
        product of discovery.--
                  (A) In the case of any civil investigative 
                demand issued under subsection (a) which is an 
                express demand for any product of discovery, 
                the person from whom such discovery was 
                obtained may file, in the district court of the 
                United States for the judicial district in 
                which the proceeding in which such discovery 
                was obtained is or was last pending, and serve 
                upon any false claims law investigator 
                identified in the demand and upon the recipient 
                of the demand, a petition for an order of such 
                court to modify or set aside those portions of 
                the demand requiring production of any such 
                product of discovery. Any petition under this 
                subparagraph must be filed--
                          (i) within 20 days after the date of 
                        service of the civil investigative 
                        demand, or at any time before the 
                        return date specified in the demand, 
                        whichever date is earlier, or
                          (ii) within such longer period as may 
                        be prescribed in writing by any false 
                        claims law investigator identified in 
                        the demand.
                  (B) The petition shall specify each ground 
                upon which the petitioner relies in seeking 
                relief under subparagraph (A), and may be based 
                upon any failure of the portions of the demand 
                from which relief is sought to comply with the 
                provisions of this section, or upon any 
                constitutional or other legal right or 
                privilege of the petitioner. During the 
                pendency of the petition, the court may stay, 
                as it deems proper, compliance with the demand 
                and the running of the time allowed for 
                compliance with the demand.
          (4) Petition to require performance by custodian of 
        duties.--At any time during which any custodian is in 
        custody or control of any documentary material or 
        answers to interrogatories produced, or transcripts of 
        oral testimony given, by any person in compliance with 
        any civil investigative demand issued under subsection 
        (a), such person, and in the case of an express demand 
        for any product of discovery, the person from whom such 
        discovery was obtained, may file, in the district court 
        of the United States for the judicial district within 
        which the office of such custodian is situated, and 
        serve upon such custodian, a petition for an order of 
        such court to require the performance by the custodian 
        of any duty imposed upon the custodian by this section.
          (5) Jurisdiction.--Whenever any petition is filed in 
        any district court of the United States under this 
        subsection, such court shall have jurisdiction to hear 
        and determine the matter so presented, and to enter 
        such order or orders as may be required to carry out 
        the provisions of this section. Any final order so

                                resale) specifies a longer 
                                acceptance period, as 
                                determined by the contracting 
                                officer to be required to 
                                afford the agency a practicable 
                                opportunity to inspect and test 
                                the property furnished or 
                                evaluate the services 
                                performed; or
                  (B) on the date of the invoice, if the agency 
                has failed to annotate the invoice with the 
                date of receipt at the time of actual receipt 
                by the place or person designated by the agency 
                to first receive such invoice.
          (5) a payment is deemed to be made on the date a 
        check for payment is dated or an electronic fund 
        transfer is made.
          (6) a contract to rent property is deemed to be a 
        contract to acquire the property.
  (b) This chapter applies to the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
However, regulations prescribed under this chapter do not apply 
to the Authority, and the Authority alone is responsible for 
carrying out this chapter as it applies to contracts of the 
Authority.
  (c) This chapter, except section 3906 of this title, applies 
to the United States Postal Service. However, the Postmaster 
General shall be responsible for issuing the implementing 
procurement regulations, solicitation provisions, and contract 
clauses for the United States Postal Service.

SEC. 3902. INTEREST PENALTIES.

  (a) Under regulations prescribed under section 3903 of this 
title, the head of an agency acquiring property or service from 
a business concern, who does not pay the concern for each 
complete delivered item of property or service by the required 
payment date, shall pay an interest penalty to the concern on 
the amount of the payment due. The interest shall be computed 
at the rate of interest established by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest 
payments under section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 
(41 U.S.C. 611), which is in effect at the time the agency 
accrues the obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty.
  (b) Except as provided in section 3906 of this title, the 
interest penalty shall be paid for the period beginning on the 
day after the required payment date and ending on the date on 
which payment is made.
  (c)(1) A business concern shall be entitled to an interest 
penalty of $1.00 or more which is owed such business concern 
under this section, and such penalty shall be paid without 
regard to whether the business concern has requested payment of 
such penalty.
  (2) Each payment subject to this chapter for which a late 
payment interest penalty is required to be paid shall be 
accompanied by a notice stating the amount of the interest 
penalty included in such payment and the rate by which, and 
period for which, such penalty was computed.
  (3) If a business concern--
          (A) is owed an interest penalty by an agency;
          (B) is not paid the interest penalty in a payment 
        made to the business concern by the agency on or after 
        the date on which the interest penalty becomes due;
          (C) is not paid the interest penalty by the agency 
        within 10 days after the date on which such payment is 
        made; and
          (D) makes a written demand, not later than 40 days 
        after the date on which such payment is made, that the 
        agency pay such a penalty,
such business concern shall be entitled to an amount equal to 
the sum of the late payment interest penalty to which the 
contractor is entitled and an additional penalty equal to a 
percentage of such late payment interest penalty specified by 
regulation by the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, subject to such maximum as may be specified in such 
regulations.
  (d) The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely 
payment due for property or services does not relieve the head 
of an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties 
under this section.
  (e) An amount of an interest penalty unpaid after any 30-day 
period shall be added to the principal amount of the debt, and 
a penalty accrues thereafter on the added amount.
  (f) This section does not authorize the appropriation of 
additional amounts to pay an interest penalty. The head of an 
agency shall pay a penalty under this section out of amounts 
made available to carry out the program for which the penalty 
is incurred.
  (g) A recipient of a grant from the head of an agency may 
provide in a contract for the acquisition of property or 
service from a business concern that, consistent with the usual 
business practices of the recipient and applicable State and 
local law, the recipient will pay an interest penalty on 
amounts overdue under the contract under conditions agreed to 
by the recipient and the concern. The recipient may not pay the 
penalty from amounts received from an agency. Amounts expended 
for the penalty may not be counted toward a matching 
requirement applicable to the grant. An obligation to pay the 
penalty is not an obligation of the United States Government.
  (h)(1) This section shall apply to contracts for the 
procurement of property or services entered into pursuant to 
section 4(h) of the Act of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714b(h)).
  (2)(A) In the case of a payment to which producers on a farm 
are entitled under the terms of an agreement entered into under 
the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.), an 
interest penalty shall be paid to the producers if the payment 
has not been made by the required payment or loan closing date. 
The interest penalty shall be paid--
          (i) on the amount of payment or loan due; and
          (ii) for the period beginning on the first day 
        beginning after the required payment or loan closing 
        date and ending on the date the amount is paid or 
        loaned.
  (B) As used in this subsection, the ``required payment or 
loan closing date'' means--
          (i) for a purchase agreement, the 30th day after 
        delivery of the warehouse receipt for the commodity 
        subject to the purchase agreement;
          (ii) for a loan agreement, the 30th day beginning 
        after the date of receipt of an application with all 
        requisite documentation and signatures, unless the 
        applicant requests that the disbursement be deferred;
          (iii) for refund of amounts received greater than the 
        amount required to repay a commodity loan, the first 
        business day after the Commodity Credit Corporation 
        receives payment for such loan;
          (iv) for land diversion payments (other than advance 
        payments), the 30th day beginning after the date of 
        completion of the production adjustment contract by the 
        producer;
          (v) for an advance land diversion payment, 30 days 
        after the date the Commodity Credit Corporation 
        executes the contract with the producer;
          (vi) for a deficiency payment (other than advance 
        payments) based upon a 12-month or 5-month period, 91 
        days after the end of such period; or
          (vii) for an advance deficiency payment, 30 days 
        after the date the Commodity Credit Corporation 
        executes the contract with the producer.
  (3) Payment of the interest penalty under this subsection 
shall be made out of funds available under section 8 of the Act 
of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714f).
  (4) Section 3907 of this title shall not apply to interest 
penalty payments made under this subsection.

        periodic payments for partial deliveries or other 
        contract performance during the contract period, upon--
                  (A) submission of an invoice for property 
                delivered or services performed during the 
                contract period, if an invoice is required by

                the property or services; or
                  (ii) the making of a determination by such an 
                employee, that the performance covered by the

        payments for completed phases, increments, or segments 
        of any project) that is approved as payable by the 
        agency pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and 
        remains unpaid for--
                  (i) a period of more than 14 days after 
                receipt of the payment request by the place or 
                person designated by the agency to first 
                receive such requests; or
                  (ii) a longer period, specified in the 
                solicitation, if required to afford the 
                Government a practicable opportunity to 
                adequately inspect the work and to determine 
                the adequacy of the contractor's performance 
                under the contract; and
          (B) any amounts which the agency has retained 
        pursuant to a prime contract clause providing for 
        retaining a percentage of progress payments otherwise 
        due to a contractor and that are approved for release 
        to the contractor, if such retained amounts are not 
        paid to the contractor by a date specified in the 
        contract or, in the absence of such a specified date, 
        by the 30th day after final acceptance;
    (7) require that--
          (A) each invoice be reviewed as soon as practicable 
        after receipt for the purpose of determining that such 
        an invoice is a proper invoice within the meaning of 
        section 3901(a)(3) of this title;
          (B) any invoice determined not to be such a proper 
        invoice suitable for payment shall be returned as soon 
        as practicable, but not later than 7 days, after 
        receipt, specifying the reasons that the invoice is not 
        a proper invoice; and
          (C) the number of days available to an agency to make 
        a timely payment of an invoice without incurring an 
        interest penalty shall be reduced by the number of days 
        by which an agency exceeds the requirements of 
        subparagraph (B) of this paragraph;
    (8) permit an agency to make payment up to 7 days prior to 
the required payment date, or earlier as determined by the 
agency to be necessary on a case-by-case basis; and
    (9) prescribe the methods for computing interest under 
section 3903(c) of this title.
    (b)(1) A payment request may not be approved under 
subsection (a)(6)(A) of this section unless the application for 
such payment includes--
          (A) substantiation of the amounts requested; and

        best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, that--
                  (i) the amounts requested are only for 
                performance in accordance with the 
                specifications, terms, and conditions of the 
                contract;
                  (ii) payments to subcontractors and suppliers 
                have been made from previous payments received 
                under the contract, and timely payments will be 
                made from the proceeds of the payment covered 
                by the certification, in accordance with their 
                subcontract agreements and the requirements of 
                this chapter; and
                  (iii) the application does not include any 
                amounts which the prime contractor intends to 
                withhold or retain from a subcontractor or 
                supplier in accordance with the terms and 
                conditions of their subcontract.
    (2) The agency shall return any such payment request which 
is defective to the contractor within 7 days after receipt, 
with a statement identifying the defect.
    (c)(1) The contracting officer shall--
          (A) compute the interest which a contractor shall be 
        obligated to pay under sections 3905(a)(2) and 
        3905(e)(6) of this title on the basis of the average 
        bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills 
        auctioned at the most recent auction of such bills 
        prior to the date the contractor received the unearned 
        amount; and
          (B) deduct the interest amount determined under 
        subparagraph (A) of this paragraph from the next 
        available payment to the contractor.
    (2) Amounts deducted from payments to contractors under 
paragraph (1)(B) shall revert to the Treasury.

SEC. 3904. LIMITATIONS ON DISCOUNT PAYMENTS.

  The head of an agency offered a discount by a business 
concern from an amount due under a contract for property or 
service in exchange for payment within a specified time may pay 
the discounted amount only if payment is made within the 
specified time. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the 
specified time shall be determined from the date of the 
invoice. The head of the agency shall pay an interest penalty 
on an amount remaining unpaid in violation of this section. The 
penalty accrues as provided under sections 3902 and 3903 of 
this title, except that the required payment date for the 
unpaid amount is the last day specified in the contract that 
the discounted amount may be paid.

SEC. 3905. PAYMENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS.

  (a) In the event that a contractor, after making a certified 
payment request to an agency pursuant to section 3903(b) of 
this title, discovers that a portion or all of such payment 
request constitutes a payment for performance by such 
contractor that fails to conform to the specifications, terms, 
and conditions of its contract (hereafter in this subsection 
referred to as the ``unearned amount''), then the contractor 
shall--
          (1) notify the agency of such performance deficiency; 
        and
          (2) be obligated to pay the Government an amount 
        equal to interest on the unearned amount (computed in 
        the manner provided in section 3903(c) of this title), 
        from the date of the contractor's receipt of such 
        unearned amount until--
                  (A) the date the contractor notifies the 
                agency that the performance deficiency has been 
                corrected; or
                  (B) the date the contractor reduces the 
                amount of any subsequent certified application 
                for payment to such agency by an amount equal 
                to the unearned amount.
  (b) Each construction contract awarded by an agency shall 
include a clause that requires the prime contractor to include 
in each subcontract for property or services entered into by 
the prime contractor and a subcontractor (including a material 
supplier) for the purpose of performing such construction 
contract--
          (1) a payment clause which obligates the prime 
        contractor to pay the subcontractor for satisfactory 
        performance under its subcontract within 7 days out of 
        such amounts as are paid to the prime contractor by the 
        agency under such contract; and
          (2) an interest penalty clause which obligates the 
        prime contractor to pay to the subcontractor an 
        interest penalty on amounts due in the case of each 
        payment not made in accordance with the payment clause 
        included in the subcontract pursuant to paragraph (1) 
        of this subsection--
                  (A) for the period beginning on the day after 
                the required payment date and ending on the 
                date on which payment of the amount due is 
                made; and
                  (B) computed at the rate specified by section 
                3902(a) of this title.
  (c) The construction contract awarded by the agency shall 
further require the prime contractor to include in each of its 
subcontracts (for the purpose of performance of such 
construction contract) a provision requiring the subcontractor 
to include a payment clause and an interest penalty clause 
conforming to the standards of subsection (b) of this section 
in each of its subcontracts and to require each of its 
subcontractors to include such clauses in their subcontracts 
with each lower-tier subcontractor or supplier.
  (d) The clauses required by subsections (b) and (c) of this 
section shall not be construed to impair the right of a prime 
contractor or a subcontractor at any tier to negotiate, and to 
conclude in their subcontract, provisions which--
          (1) permit the prime contractor or a subcontractor to 
        retain (without cause) a specified percentage of each 
        progress payment otherwise due to a subcontractor for 
        satisfactory performance under the subcontract, without 
        incurring any obligation to pay a late payment interest 
        penalty, in accordance with terms and conditions agreed 
        to by the parties to the subcontract, giving such 
        recognition as the parties deem appropriate to the 
        ability of a subcontractor to furnish a performance 
        bond and a payment bond;
          (2) permit the contractor or subcontractor to make a 
        determination that part or all of the subcontractor's 
        request for payment may be withheld in accordance with 
        the subcontract agreement; and
          (3) permit such withholding without incurring any 
        obligation to pay a late payment penalty if--
                  (A) a notice conforming to the standards of 
                subsection (g) of this section has been 
                previously furnished to the subcontractor; and
                  (B) a copy of any notice issued by a prime 
                contractor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this 
                paragraph has been furnished to the Government.
  (e) If a prime contractor, after making application to an 
agency for payment under a contract but before making a payment 
to a subcontractor for the subcontractor's performance covered 
by such application, discovers that all or a portion of the 
payment otherwise due such subcontractor is subject to 
withholding from the subcontractor in accordance with the 
subcontract agreement, then the prime contractor shall--
          (1) furnish to the subcontractor a notice conforming 
        to the standards of subsection (g) of this section as 
        soon as practicable upon ascertaining the cause giving 
        rise to a withholding, but prior to the due date for 
        subcontractor payment;
          (2) furnish to the Government, as soon as 
        practicable, a copy of the notice furnished to the 
        subcontractor pursuant to paragraph (1) of this 
        subsection;
          (3) reduce the subcontractor's progress payment by an 
        amount not to exceed the amount specified in the notice 
        of withholding furnished under paragraph (1) of this 
        subsection;
          (4) pay the subcontractor as soon as practicable 
        after the correction of the identified subcontract 
        performance deficiency, and--
                  (A) make such payment within--
                          (i) 7 days after correction of the 
                        identified subcontract performance 
                        deficiency (unless the funds therefor 
                        must be recovered from the Government 
                        because of a reduction under paragraph 
                        (5)(A)); or
                          (ii) 7 days after the contractor 
                        recovers such funds from the 
                        Government; or
                  (B) incur an obligation to pay a late payment 
                interest penalty computed at the rate specified

          (5) notify the Government, upon--
                  (A) reduction of the amount of any subsequent 
                certified application for payment; or
                  (B) payment to the subcontractor of any 
                withheld amounts of a progress payment, 
                specifying--
                          (i) the amounts of the progress 
                        payments withheld under paragraph (1) 
                        of this subsection; and
                          (ii) the dates that such withholding 
                        began and ended; and
          (6) be obligated to pay to the Government an amount 
        equal to interest on the withheld payments (computed in 
        the manner provided in section 3903(c) of this title), 
        from the 8th day after receipt of the withheld amounts 
        from the Government until--
                  (A) the day the identified subcontractor 
                performance deficiency is corrected; or
                  (B) the date that any subsequent payment is 
                reduced under paragraph (5)(A).
  (f)(1) If a prime contractor, after making payment to a 
first-tier subcontractor, receives from a supplier or 
subcontractor of the first-tier subcontractor (hereafter 
referred to as a ``second-tier subcontractor'') a written 
notice in accordance with section 2 of the Act of August 24, 
1935 (40 U.S.C. 270b), asserting a deficiency in such first-
tier subcontractor's performance under the contract for which 
the prime contractor may be ultimately liable, and the prime 
contractor determines that all or a portion of future payments 
otherwise due such first-tier subcontractor is subject to 
withholding in accordance with the subcontract agreement, then 
the prime contractor may, without incurring an obligation to 
pay an interest penalty under subsection (e)(6) of this 
section--
          (A) furnish to the first-tier subcontractor a notice 
        conforming to the standards of subsection (g) of this 
        section as soon as practicable upon making such 
        determination; and
          (B) withhold from the first-tier subcontractor's next 
        available progress payment or payments an amount not to 
        exceed the amount specified in the notice of 
        withholding furnished under subparagraph (A) of this 
        paragraph.
  (2) As soon as practicable, but not later than 7 days after 
receipt of satisfactory written notification that the 
identified subcontract performance deficiency has been 
corrected, the prime contractor shall pay the amount withheld 
under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection to such first-tier 
subcontractor, or shall incur an obligation to pay a late 
payment interest penalty to such first-tier subcontractor 
computed at the rate specified by section 3902(a) of this 
title.
  (g) A written notice of any withholding shall be issued to a 
subcontractor (with a copy to the Government of any such notice 
issued by a prime contractor), specifying--
          (1) the amount to be withheld;
          (2) the specific causes for the withholding under the 
        terms of the subcontract; and
          (3) the remedial actions to be taken by the 
        subcontractor in order to receive payment of the 
        amounts withheld.
  (h) A prime contractor may not request payment from the 
agency of any amount withheld or retained in accordance with 
subsection (d) of this section until such time as the prime 
contractor has determined and certified to the agency that the 
subcontractor is entitled to the payment of such amount.
  (i) A dispute between a contractor and subcontractor relating 
to the amount or entitlement of a subcontractor to a payment or 
a late payment interest penalty under a clause included in the 
subcontract pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section 
does not constitute a dispute to which the United States is a 
party. The United States may not be interpleaded in any 
judicial or administrative proceeding involving such a dispute.
  (j) Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, 
this section shall not limit or impair any contractual, 
administrative, or judicial remedies otherwise available to a 
contractor or a subcontractor in the event of a dispute 
involving late payment or nonpayment by a prime contractor or 
deficient subcontract performance or nonperformance by a 
subcontractor.
  (k) A contractor's obligation to pay an interest penalty to a 
subcontractor pursuant to the clauses included in a subcontract 
under subsection (b) or (c) of this section may not be 
construed to be an obligation of the United States for such 
interest penalty. A contract modification may not be made for 
the purpose of providing reimbursement of such interest 
penalty. A cost reimbursement claim may not include any amount 
for reimbursement of such interest penalty.

SEC. 3906. REPORTS.

  (a)(1) By the 60th day after the end of the fiscal year, the 
head of each agency shall submit to the Director of the Office 
of Management and Budget a report on the agency's payment 
practices during that fiscal year, including a description of 
the extent to which those practices satisfy the requirements of 
this chapter.
  (2) In addition to such other information as may be required 
by the Director, the report required by paragraph (1) shall 
include--
          (A) the number, dollar value, and percentage of 
        invoices for which interest or other late payment 
        penalties were paid, the amount of such late payment 
        interest and other penalties, and the reasons the 
        interest penalties were not avoided by prompt payment; 
        and
          (B) the number, dollar value, and percentage of 
        invoices paid after the required payment date without 
        payment of an interest penalty or other late payment 
        penalty, and the reasons no obligation to pay such 
        penalties was incurred with respect to such invoices or 
        no amount for such penalties were included in the 
        payments of such invoices.
  (b) By the 120th day after the end of each fiscal year, the 
Director shall submit to the Committees on Governmental 
Affairs, Appropriations, and Small Business of the Senate and 
the Committees on Government Operations, Appropriations, and 
Small Business of the House of Representatives a report on 
agency compliance with this chapter. The report shall include a 
summary of the report of each agency submitted under subsection 
(a) of this section and an analysis of progress made in 
reducing interest penalty payments by that agency from prior 
years.

SEC. 3907. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.

  (a) A claim for an interest penalty not paid under this 
chapter may be filed under section 6 of the Contract Disputes 
Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605).
  (b)(1) An interest penalty under this chapter does not 
continue to accrue--
          (A) after a claim for a penalty is filed under the 
        Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); 
        or
          (B) for more than one year.
  (2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection does not prevent an 
interest penalty from accruing under section 12 of the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) after a penalty stops 
accruing under this chapter. A penalty accruing under section 
12 may accrue on an unpaid contract payment and on the unpaid 
penalty under this chapter.
  (c) Except as provided in section 3904 of this title, this 
chapter does not require an interest penalty on a payment that 
is not made because of a dispute between the head of an agency 
and a business concern over the amount of payment or compliance 
with the contract. A claim related to the dispute, and interest 
payable for the period during which the dispute is being 
resolved, is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.).

          (A)(i) the financial statements of the government, 
        department, agency, or establishment present fairly its 
        financial position and the results of its financial 
        operations in accordance with generally accepted

requirements of this chapter, which receives Federal financial 
assistance and provides $25,000 or more of such assistance in

                corrective action is taken on instances of 
                material noncompliance with applicable laws and 
                regulations with respect to Federal financial 
                assistance provided to the subrecipient by the 
                State or local government.
  (2) Each such State and local government shall require each 
subrecipient of Federal assistance through such government to 
permit, as a condition of receiving funds from such assistance, 
the independent auditor of the State or local government to 
have such access to the subrecipient's records and financial 
statements as may be necessary for the State or local 
government to comply with this chapter.
  (f) The report made on any audit conducted pursuant to this 
section shall, within thirty days after completion of such 
report, be transmitted to the appropriate Federal officials and 
made available by the State or local government for public 
inspection.
  (g) If an audit conducted pursuant to this section finds any 
material noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations by, 
or material weakness in the internal controls of, the State or 
local government with respect to the matters described in 
subsection (d)(2), the State or local government shall submit 
to appropriate Federal officials a plan for corrective action 
to eliminate such material noncompliance or weakness or a 
statement describing the reasons that corrective action is not 
necessary. Such plan shall be consistent with the audit 
resolution standard promulgated by the Comptroller General (as 
part of the standards for internal controls in the Federal 
Government) pursuant to section 3512(c) of this title.

SEC. 7503. RELATION TO OTHER AUDIT REQUIREMENTS.

  (a) An audit conducted in accordance with this chapter shall 
be in lieu of any financial or financial and compliance audit 
of an individual Federal assistance program which a State or 
local government is required to conduct under any other Federal 
law or regulation. To the extent that such audit provided a 
Federal agency with the information it requires to carry out 
its responsibilities under Federal law or regulation, a Federal 
agency shall rely upon and use that information and plan and 
conduct its own audits accordingly in order to avoid a 
duplication of effort.
  (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a Federal agency shall 
conduct any additional audits which are necessary to carry out 
its responsibilities under Federal law or regulation. The 
provisions of this chapter do not authorize any State or local 
government (or subrecipient thereof) to constrain, in any 
manner, such agency from carrying out such additional audits.
  (c) The provisions of this chapter do not limit the authority 
of Federal agencies to conduct, or enter into contracts for the 
conduct of, audits and evaluations of Federal financial 
assistance programs, nor limit the authority of any Federal 
agency Inspector General or other Federal audit official.
  (d) Subsection (a) shall apply to a State or local government 
which conducts an audit in accordance with this chapter even 
though it is not required by section 7502(a) to conduct such 
audit.
  (e) A Federal agency that performs or contracts for audits in 
addition to the audits conducted by recipients pursuant to this 
chapter shall, consistent with other applicable law, arrange 
for funding the cost of such additional audits. Such additional 
audits include economy and efficiency audits, program results 
audits, and program evaluations.

SEC. 7504. COGNIZANT AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES.

  (a) The Director shall designate cognizant agencies for 
audits conducted pursuant to this chapter.
  (b) A cognizant agency shall--
          (1) ensure that audits are made in a timely manner 
        and in accordance with the requirements of this 
        chapter;
          (2) ensure that the audit reports and corrective 
        action plans made pursuant to section 7502 of this 
        title are transmitted to the appropriate Federal 
        officials; and
          (3) (A) coordinate, to the extent practicable, audits 
        done by or under contract with Federal agencies that 
        are in addition to the audits conducted pursuant to 
        this chapter; and
          (B) ensure that such additional audits build upon the 
        audits conducted pursuant to this chapter.

SEC. 7505. REGULATIONS.

  (a) The Director, after consultation with the Comptroller 
General and appropriate Federal, State, and local government 
officials, shall prescribe policies, procedures, and guidelines 
to implement this chapter. Each Federal agency shall promulgate 
such amendments to its regulations as may be necessary to 
conform such regulations to the requirements of this chapter 
and of such policies, procedures, and guidelines.
  (b)(1) The policies, procedures, and guidelines prescribed 
pursuant to subsection (a) shall include criteria for 
determining the appropriate charges to programs of Federal 
financial assistance for the cost of audits. Such criteria 
shall prohibit a State or local government which is required to 
conduct an audit pursuant to this chapter from charging to any 
such program (A) the cost of any financial or financial and 
compliance audit which is not conducted in accordance with this 
chapter, and (B) more than a reasonably proportionate share of 
the cost of any such audit that is conducted in accordance with 
this chapter.
  (2) The criteria prescribed pursuant to paragraph (1) shall 
not, in the absence of documentation demonstrating a higher 
actual cost, permit (A) the ratio of (i) the total charges by a 
government to Federal financial assistance programs for the 
cost of audits performed pursuant to this chapter, to (ii) the 
total cost of such audits, to exceed (B) the ratio of (i) total 
Federal financial assistance expended by such government during 
the applicable fiscal year or years, to (ii) such government's 
total expenditures during such fiscal year or years.
  (c) Such policies, procedures, and guidelines shall include 
such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that small 
business concerns and business concerns owned and controlled by 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals will have 
the opportunity to participate in the performance of contracts 
awarded to fulfill the audit requirements of this chapter.

SEC. 7506. MONITORING RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL.

  The Comptroller General shall review provisions requiring 
financial or financial and compliance audits of recipients of 
Federal assistance that are contained in bills and resolutions 
reported by the committees of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives. If the Comptroller General determines that a 
bill or resolution contains provisions that are inconsistent 
with the requirements of this chapter, the Comptroller General 
shall, at the earliest practicable date, notify in writing--
          (1) the committee that reported such bill or 
        resolution; and
          (2)(A) the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the 
        Senate (in the case of a bill or resolution reported by 
        a committee of the Senate); or
          (B) the Committee on Government Operations of the 
        House of Representatives (in the case of a bill or 
        resolution reported by a committee of the House of 
        Representatives).

SEC. 7507. EFFECTIVE DATE; REPORT.

  (a) This chapter shall apply to any State or local government 
with respect to any of its fiscal years which begin after 
December 31, 1984.
  (b) The Director, on or before May 1, 1987, and annually 
thereafter, shall submit to each House of Congress a report on 
operations under this chapter. Each such report shall 
specifically identify each Federal agency or State or local 
government which is failing to comply with this chapter.

                       CHAPTER 97--MISCELLANEOUS

SEC. 9701. FEES AND CHARGES FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND THINGS OF 
                    VALUE.

  (a) It is the sense of Congress that each service or thing of 
value provided by an agency (except a mixed-ownership 
Government corporation) to a person (except a person on 
official business of the United States Government) is to be 
self-sustaining to the extent possible.
  (b) The head of each agency (except a mixed-ownership 
Government corporation) may prescribe regulations establishing 
the charge for a service or thing of value provided by the 
agency. Regulations prescribed by the heads of executive 
agencies are subject to policies prescribed by the President 
and shall be as uniform as practicable. Each charge shall be--
          (1) fair; and
          (2) based on--
                  (A) the costs to the Government;
                  (B) the value of the service or thing to the 
                recipient;
                  (C) public policy or interest served; and
                  (D) other relevant facts.
  (c) This section does not affect a law of the United States--
          (1) prohibiting the determination and collection of 
        charges and the disposition of those charges; and
          (2) prescribing bases for determining charges, but a 
        charge may be redetermined under this section 
        consistent with the prescribed bases.

SEC. 9702. INVESTMENT OF TRUST FUNDS.

  Except as required by a treaty of the United States, amounts 
held in trust by the United States Government (including annual 
interest earned on the amounts)--
          (1) shall be invested in Government obligations; and
          (2) shall earn interest at an annual rate of at least 
        5 percent.

SEC. 9703. MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY.

  (a) Beginning with fiscal year 1999, the performance plans 
required under section 1115 may include proposals to waive 
administrative procedural requirements and controls, including 
specification of personnel staffing levels, limitations on 
compensation or remuneration, and prohibitions or restrictions 
on funding transfers among budget object classification 20 and 
subclassifications 11, 12, 31, and 32 of each annual budget 
submitted under section 1105, in return for specific individual 
or organization accountability to achieve a performance goal. 
In preparing and submitting the performance plan under section 
1105(a)(29), the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget shall review and may approve any proposed waivers. A 
waiver shall take effect at the beginning of the fiscal year 
for which the waiver is approved.
  (b) Any such proposal under subsection (a) shall describe the 
anticipated effects on performance resulting from greater 
managerial or organizational flexibility, discretion, and 
authority, and shall quantify the expected improvements in 
performance resulting from any waiver. The expected 
improvements shall be compared to current actual performance, 
and to the projected level of performance that would be 
achieved independent of any waiver.
  (c) Any proposal waiving limitations on compensation or 
remuneration shall precisely express the monetary change in 
compensation or remuneration amounts, such as bonuses or 
awards, that shall result from meeting, exceeding, or failing 
to meet performance goals.
  (d) Any proposed waiver of procedural requirements or 
controls imposed by an agency (other than the proposing agency 
or the Office of Management and Budget) may not be included in 
a performance plan unless it is endorsed by the agency that 
established the requirement, and the endorsement included in 
the proposing agency's performance plan.
  (e) A waiver shall be in effect for one or two years as 
specified by the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget in approving the waiver. A waiver may be renewed for a 
subsequent year. After a waiver has been in effect for three 
consecutive years, the performance plan prepared under section 
1115 may propose that a waiver, other than a waiver of 
limitations on compensation or remuneration, be made permanent.
  (f) For purposes of this section, the definitions under 
section 1115(f) shall apply.

SEC. 9704. PILOT PROJECTS FOR MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
                    FLEXIBILITY.

  (a) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall 
designate not less than five agencies as pilot projects in 
managerial accountability and flexibility for fiscal years 1995 
and 1996. Such agencies shall be selected from those designated 
as pilot projects under section 1118 and shall reflect a 
representative range of Government functions and capabilities 
in measuring and reporting program performance.
  (b) Pilot projects in the designated agencies shall include 
proposed waivers in accordance with section 9703 for one or 
more of the major functions and operations of the agency.
  (c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall 
include in the report to the President and to the Congress 
required under section 1118(c)--
          (1) an assessment of the benefits, costs, and 
        usefulness of increasing managerial and organizational 
        flexibility, discretion, and authority in exchange for 
        improved performance through a waiver; and
          (2) an identification of any significant difficulties 
        experienced by the pilot agencies in preparing proposed 
        waivers.
  (d) For purposes of this section the definitions under 
section 1115(f) shall apply.

                CHAPTER 17--CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE

SEC. 601. ESTABLISHMENT.

  (a) In General.--
          (1) There is established an office of the Congress to 
        be known as the Congressional Budget Office 
        (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the 
        ``Office''). The Office shall be headed by a Director; 
        and there shall be a Deputy Director who shall perform 
        such duties as may be assigned to him by the Director 
        and, during the absence or incapacity of the Director 
        or during a vacancy in that office, shall act as 
        Director.
          (2) The Director shall be appointed by the Speaker of 
        the House of Representatives and the President pro 
        tempore of the Senate after considering recommendations 
        received from the Committees on the Budget of the House 
        and the Senate, without regard to political affiliation 
        and solely on the basis of his fitness to perform his 
        duties. The Deputy Director shall be appointed by the 
        Director.
          (3) The term of office of the Director first 
        appointed shall expire at noon on January 3, 1979, and 
        the terms of office of Directors subsequently appointed 
        shall expire at noon on January 3 of each fourth year 
        thereafter. Any individual appointed as Director to 
        fill a vacancy prior to the expiration of a term shall 
        serve only for the unexpired portion of that term. An 
        individual serving as Director at the expiration of a 
        term may continue to serve until his successor is 
        appointed. Any Deputy Director shall serve until the 
        expiration of the term of office of the Director who 
        appointed him (and until his successor is appointed), 
        unless sooner removed by the Director.
          (4) The Director may be removed by either House by 
        resolution.
          (5) The Director shall receive compensation at a per 
        annum gross rate equal to the rate of basic pay, as in 
        effect from time to time, for level III of the 
        Executive Schedule in section 5314 of Title 5. The 
        Deputy Director shall receive compensation at a per 
        annum gross rate equal to the rate of basic pay, as so 
        in effect, for level IV of the Executive Schedule in 
        section 5315 of such title.
  (b) Personnel.--The Director shall appoint and fix the 
compensation of such personnel as may be necessary to carry out 
the duties and functions of the Office. All personnel of the 
Office shall be appointed without regard to political 
affiliation and solely on the basis of their fitness to perform 
their duties. The Director may prescribe the duties and 
responsibilities of the personnel of the Office, and delegate 
to them authority to perform any of the duties, powers, and 
functions imposed on the Office or on the Director. For 
purposes of pay (other than pay of the Director and Deputy 
Director) and employment benefits, rights, and privileges, all 
personnel of the Office shall be treated as if they were 
employees of the House of Representatives.
  (c) Experts and Consultants.--In carrying out the duties and 
functions of the Office, the Director may procure the temporary 
(not to exceed one year) or intermittent services of experts or 
consultants or organizations thereof by contract as independent 
contractors, or, in the case of individual experts or 
consultants, by employment at rates of pay not in excess of the 
daily equivalent of the highest rate of basic pay payable under 
the General Schedule of section 5332 of Title 5.
  (d) Relationship to Executive Branch.--The Director is 
authorized to secure information, data, estimates, and 
statistics directly from the various departments, agencies, and 
establishments of the executive branch of Government and the 
regulatory agencies and commissions of the Government. All such 
departments, agencies, establishments, and regulatory agencies 
and commissions shall furnish the Director any available 
material which he determines to be necessary in the performance 
of his duties and functions (other than material the disclosure 
of which would be a violation of law). The Director is also 
authorized, upon agreement with the head of any such 
department, agency, establishment, or regulatory agency or 
commission, to utilize its services, facilities, and personnel 
with or without reimbursement; and the head of each such 
department, agency, establishment, or regulatory agency or 
commission is authorized to provide the Office such services, 
facilities, and personnel.
  (e) Relationship to Other Agencies of Congress.--In carrying 
out the duties and functions of the Office, and for the purpose 
of coordinating the operations of the Office with those of 
other congressional agencies with a view to utilizing most 
effectively the information, services, and capabilities of all 
such agencies in carrying out the various responsibilities 
assigned to each, the Director is authorized to obtain 
information, data, estimates, and statistics developed by the 
General Accounting Office, the Library of Congress, and the 
Office of Technology Assessment, and (upon agreement with them) 
to utilize their services, facilities, and personnel with or 
without reimbursement. The Comptroller General, the Librarian 
of Congress, and the Technology Assessment Board are authorized 
to provide the Office with the information, data, estimates, 
and statistics, and the services, facilities, and personnel, 
referred to in the preceding sentence.
  (f) Redesignated (g)
  (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to 
be appropriated to the Office for each fiscal year such sums as 
may be necessary to enable it to carry out its duties and 
functions. Until sums are first appropriated pursuant to the 
preceding sentence, but for a period not exceeding 12 months 
following the effective date of this subsection, the expenses 
of the Office shall be paid from the contingent fund of the 
Senate, in accordance with section 68 of this title, and upon 
vouchers approved by the Director.
  (g) Revenue Estimates.--For the purposes of revenue 
legislation which is income, estate and gift, excise, and 
payroll taxes (i.e., Social Security), considered or enacted in 
any session of Congress, the Congressional Budget Office shall 
use exclusively during that session of Congress revenue 
estimates provided to it by the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
During that session of Congress such revenue estimates shall be 
transmitted by the Congressional Budget Office to any committee 
of the House of Representatives or the Senate requesting such 
estimates, and shall be used by such Committees in determining 
such estimates. The Budget Committees of the Senate and House 
shall determine all estimates with respect to scoring points of 
order and with respect to the execution of the purposes of this 
Act.

        under subparagraph (A), the Director shall provide 
        estimates, if and to the extent that the Director

                joint resolution upon any particular industries 
                or sectors of the economy, States, regions, and 
                urban or rural or other types of communities; 
                and
                  (iii) the effect of Federal private sector 
                mandates in the bill or joint resolution on the

                on such legislation reports such legislation, 
                if, to the extent that the costs of such 
                legislation are not included in the concurrent 
                resolution on the budget, the enactment of such 
                legislation will not increase the deficit (by

                or previously passed deficit reduction) in the 
                resolution for the first fiscal year covered by 
                the concurrent resolution on the budget, and 
                will not increase the total deficit for the

                legislation (if a conference report is 
                submitted), the chairman of the Committee on 
                the Budget of the Senate may file with the 
                Senate appropriately revised allocations under 
                section 633(a) of this title and revised 
                functional levels and aggregates to carry out 
                this paragraph;
                  (C) such revised allocations, functional 
                levels, and aggregates shall be considered for 
                the purposes of this Act as allocations, 
                functional levels, and aggregates contained in 
                the concurrent resolution on the budget; and
                  (D) the appropriate committee shall report 
                appropriately revised allocations pursuant to

of Changing Any Rule of House of Representatives.--If the 
Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives reports 
any concurrent resolution on the budget which includes any 
procedure or matter which has the effect of changing any rule 
of the House of Representatives, such concurrent resolution 
shall then be referred to the Committee on Rules with 
instructions to report it within five calendar days (not 
counting any day on which the House is not in session). The 
Committee on Rules shall have jurisdiction to report any 
concurrent resolution referred to it under this paragraph with 
an amendment or amendments changing or striking out any such 
procedure or matter.
  (d) Views and Estimates of Other Committees.--
  Within 6 weeks after the President submits a budget under 
section 1105(a)(1) of Title 31, each committee of the House of 
Representatives having legislative jurisdiction shall submit to 
the Committee on the Budget of the House and each committee of 
the Senate having legislative jurisdiction shall submit to the 
Committee on the Budget of the Senate its views and estimates 
(as determined by the committee making such submission) with 
respect to all matters set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of 
this section which relate to matters within the jurisdiction or 
functions of such committee. The Joint Economic Committee shall 
submit to the Committees on the Budget of both Houses its 
recommendations as to the fiscal policy appropriate to the 
goals of the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1021 et 
seq.]. Any other committee of the House of Representatives or 
the Senate may submit to the Committee on the Budget of its 
House, and any joint committee of the Congress may submit to 
the Committees on the Budget of both Houses, its views and 
estimates with respect to all matters set forth in subsections 
(a) and (b) of this section which relate to matters within its 
jurisdiction or functions.
  (e) Hearings and Report.--In developing the concurrent 
resolution on the budget referred to in subsection (a) of this 
section for each fiscal year, the Committee on the Budget of 
each House shall hold hearings and shall receive testimony from 
Members of Congress and such appropriate representatives of 
Federal departments and agencies, the general public, and 
national organizations as the committee deems desirable. Each 
of the recommendations as to short-term and medium-term goals 
set forth in the report submitted by the members of the Joint 
Economic Committee under subsection (d) of this section may be 
considered by the Committee on the Budget of each House as part 
of its consideration of such concurrent resolution, and its 
report may reflect its views thereon, including its views on 
how the estimates of revenues and levels of budget authority 
and outlays set forth in such concurrent resolution are 
designed to achieve any goals it is recommending. The report 
accompanying such concurrent resolution shall include, but not 
be limited to--
          (1) a comparison of revenues estimated by the 
        committee with those estimated in the budget submitted 
        by the President;

        budget outlays and total new budget authority, total 
        direct loan obligations, total primary loan guarantee 
        commitments, as set forth in such concurrent 
        resolution, with those estimated or requested in the 
        budget submitted by the President;

        with the estimate and level for existing programs being 
        divided between permanent authority and funds provided 
        in appropriation Acts, and with each such division 
        being subdivided between controllable amounts and all 
        other amounts;
          (4) an allocation of the level of Federal revenues 
        recommended in the concurrent resolution among the 
        major sources of such revenues;
          (5) the economic assumptions and objectives which 
        underlie each of the matters set forth in such 
        concurrent resolution and any alternative economic 
        assumptions and objectives which the committee 
        considered;
          (6) projections (not limited to the following), for 
        the period of five fiscal years beginning with such 
        fiscal year, of the estimated levels of total budget 
        outlays and total new budget authority, the estimated 
        revenues to be received, and the estimated surplus or 
        deficit, if any, for each fiscal year in such period, 
        and the estimated levels of tax expenditures (the tax 
        expenditures budget) by major functional categories;
          (7) a statement of any significant changes in the 
        proposed levels of Federal assistance to State and 
        local governments;
          (8) information, data, and comparisons indicating the 
        manner in which, and the basis on which, the committee 
        determined each of the matters set forth in the 
        concurrent resolution;
          (9) allocations described in section 633(a) of this 
        title.
          (10) Omitted.
  (f) Achievement of Goals for Reducing Unemployment.--
          (1) If, pursuant to section 4(c) of the Employment 
        Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1022a(c)], the President 
        recommends in the Economic Report that the goals for 
        reducing unemployment set forth in section 4(b) of such 
        Act [15 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1022a(b)] be achieved in a year 
        after the close of the five-year period prescribed by 
        such subsection, the concurrent resolution on the 
        budget for the fiscal year beginning after the date on 
        which such Economic Report is received by the Congress 
        may set forth the year in which, in the opinion of the 
        Congress, such goals can be achieved.
          (2) After the Congress has expressed its opinion 
        pursuant to paragraph (1) as to the year in which the 
        goals for reducing unemployment set forth in section 
        4(b) of the Employment Act of 1946 [15 U.S.C.A. Sec. 
        1022a(b)] can be achieved, if, pursuant to section 4(e) 
        of such Act [15 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1022a(e)], the President 
        recommends in the Economic Report that such goals be 
        achieved in a year which is different from the year in 
        which the Congress has expressed its opinion that such 
        goals should be achieved, either in its action pursuant 
        to paragraph (1) or in its most recent action pursuant 
        to this paragraph, the concurrent resolution on the 
        budget for the fiscal year beginning after the date on 
        which such Economic Report is received by the Congress 
        may set forth the year in which, in the opinion of the 
        Congress, such goals can be achieved.
          (3) It shall be in order to amend the provision of 
        such resolution setting forth such year only if the 
        amendment thereto also proposes to alter the estimates, 
        amounts, and levels (as described in subsection (a) of 
        this section) set forth in such resolution in germane 
        fashion in order to be consistent with the economic 
        goals (as described in sections 3(a)(2) [15 U.S.C.A. 
        Sec. 1022(a)(2)] and 4(b) [15 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1022a(b)] 
        of the Employment Act of 1946) which such amendment 
        proposes can be achieved by the year specified in such 
        amendment.
  (g) Economic Assumptions.--
          (1) It shall not be in order in the Senate to 
        consider any concurrent resolution on the budget for a 
        fiscal year, or any amendment thereto, or any 
        conference report thereon, that sets forth amounts and 
        levels that are determined on the basis of more than 
        one set of economic and technical assumptions.
          (2) The joint explanatory statement accompanying a 
        conference report on a concurrent resolution on the 
        budget shall set forth the common economic assumptions 
        upon which such joint statement and conference report 
        are based, or upon which any amendment contained in the 
        joint explanatory statement to be proposed by the 
        conferees in the case of technical disagreement, is 
        based.
          (3) Subject to periodic reestimation based on changed 
        economic conditions or technical estimates, 
        determinations under titles III [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 631 et 
        seq.] and IV [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 651 et seq.] of the 
        Congressional Budget Act of 1974 shall be based upon 
        such common economic and technical assumptions.
  (h) Budget Committee's Consultation With Committees.--The 
Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives shall 
consult with the committees of its House having legislative 
jurisdiction during the preparation, consideration, and 
enforcement of the concurrent resolution on the budget with 
respect to all matters which relate to the jurisdiction or 
functions of such committees.
  (i) Maximum Deficit Amount May Not Be Exceeded.--It shall not 
be in order in the Senate to consider any concurrent resolution 
on the budget as reported to the Senate that would decrease the 
excess of social security revenues over social security outlays 
in any of the fiscal years covered by the concurrent 
resolution. No change in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 [26 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1 et seq.] shall be treated as 
affecting the amount of social security revenues unless such 
provision changes the income tax treatment of social security 
benefits.

                                   NOTE

             Exclusion of Social Security from All Budgets

    Section 13301(a) of Pub. L. 101-508 provided that:
    ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts 
and disbusements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance 
Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund 
shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, 
receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--
          ``(1) the budget of the United States Government as 
        submitted by the President,
          ``(2) the congressional budget, or
          ``(3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
        Control Act of 1985 [Pub. L. 99-177, Title II, Dec. 12, 
        1985, 99 Stat. 1038].''

SEC. 633. COMMITTEE ALLOCATIONS.

  (a) Allocation of Totals.--(1) For the House of 
Representatives, the joint explanatory statement accompanying a 
conference report on a concurrent resolution on the budget 
shall include an estimated allocation, based upon such 
concurrent resolution as recommended in such conference report, 
of the appropriate levels of total budget outlays, total new 
budget authority, and total entitlement authority among each 
committee of the House of Representatives which has 
jurisdiction over laws, bills and resolutions providing such 
new budget authority, or such entitlement authority. The 
allocation shall, for each committee, divide new budget 
authority, and entitlement authority between amounts provided 
or required by law on the date of such conference report 
(mandatory or uncontrollable amounts), and amounts not so 
provided or required (discretionary or controllable amounts), 
and shall make the same division for estimated outlays that 
would result from such new budget authority.
  (2) For the Senate, the joint explanatory statement 
accompanying a conference report on a concurrent resolution on 
the budget shall include an estimated allocation, based upon 
such concurrent resolution as recommended in such conference 
report, of the appropriate levels of social security outlays 
for the fiscal year of the resolution and for each of the 4 
succeeding fiscal years, total budget outlays and total new 
budget authority among each committee of the Senate which has 
jurisdiction over bills and resolutions providing such new 
budget authority.
  (b) Reports by Committees.--As soon as practicable after a 
concurrent resolution on the budget is agreed to--
          (1) the Committee on Appropriations of each House 
        shall, after consulting with the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the other House, (A) subdivide among 
        its subcommittees the allocation of budget outlays and 
        new budget authority allocated to it in the joint 
        explanatory statement accompanying the conference 
        report on such concurrent resolution, and (B) further 
        subdivide the amount with respect to each such 
        subcommittee between controllable amounts and all other 
        amounts; and
          (2) every other committee of the House and Senate to 
        which an allocation was made in such joint explanatory 
        statement shall, after consulting with the committee or 
        committees of the other House to which all or part of 
        its allocation was made, (A) subdivide such allocation 
        among its subcommittees or among programs over which it 
        has jurisdiction, and (B) further subdivide the amount 
        with respect to each subcommittee or program between 
        controllable amounts and all other amounts.
Each such committee shall promptly report to its House the 
subdivisions made by it pursuant to this subsection.
  (c) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House of 
Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint 
resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report, 
providing--
          (1) new budget authority for a fiscal year; or
          (2) new spending authority as described in section 
        651(c)(2) of this title for a fiscal year
within the jurisdiction of any committee which has received an 
appropriate allocation of such authority pursuant to subsection 
(a) of this section for such fiscal year, unless and until such 
committee makes the allocation or subdivisions required by 
subsection (b) of this section, in connection with the most 
recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for such 
fiscal year.
  (d) Subsequent Concurrent Resolutions.--In the case of a 
concurrent resolution on the budget referred to in section 635 
of this title, the allocations under subsection (a) of this 
section and the subdivisions under subsection (b) of this 
section shall be required only to the extent necessary to take 
into account revisions made in the most recently agreed to 
concurrent resolution on the budget.
  (e) Alteration of Allocations.--At any time after a committee 
reports the allocations required to be made under subsection 
(b) of this section, such committee may report to its House an 
alteration of such allocations. Any alteration of such 
allocations must be consistent with any actions already taken 
by its House on legislation within the committee's 
jurisdiction.
  (f) Legislation Subject to Point of Order.--
          (1) In house of representatives.--After the Congress 
        has completed action on a concurrent resolution on the 
        budget for a fiscal year, it shall not be in order in 
        the House of Representatives to consider any bill, 
        joint resolution, or amendment providing new budget 
        authority for such fiscal year or new entitlement 
        authority effective during such fiscal year, or any 
        conference report on any such bill or joint resolution, 
        if--
                  (A) the enactment of such bill or resolution 
                as reported;
                  (B) the adoption and enactment of such 
                amendment; or
                  (C) the enactment of such bill or resolution 
                in the form recommended in such conference 
                report,
        would cause the appropriate allocation made pursuant to 
        subsection (b) of this section for such fiscal year of 
        new discretionary budget authority or new entitlement 
        authority to be exceeded.
          (2) In senate.--At any time after the Congress has 
        completed action on the concurrent resolution on the 
        budget required to be reported under section 632(a) of 
        this title for a fiscal year, it shall not be in order 
        in the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, 
        amendment, motion, or conference report, that provides 
        for budget outlays, new budget authority, or new 
        spending authority (as defined in section 651(c)(2) of 
        this title) in excess of (A) the appropriate allocation 
        of such outlays or authority reported under subsection 
        (a) of this section, or (B) the appropriate allocation 
        (if any) of such outlays or authority reported under 
        subsection (b) of this section in connection with the 
        most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the 
        budget for such fiscal year or provides for social 
        security outlays in excess of the appropriate 
        allocation of social security outlays under subsection 
        (a) of this section for the fiscal year of the 
        resolution or for the total of that year and the 4 
        succeeding fiscal years. Subparagraph (A) shall not 
        apply to any bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or 
        conference report that is within the jurisdiction of 
        the Committee on Appropriations. In applying this 
        paragraph--
                  (A) estimated social security outlays shall 
                be deemed to be reduced by the excess of 
                estimated social security revenues (including 
                social security revenues provided for in the 
                bill, resolution, amendment, or conference 
                report with respect to which this paragraph is 
                applied) over the appropriate level of social 
                security revenues specified in the most 
                recently adopted concurrent resolution on the 
                budget;
                  (B) estimated social security outlays shall 
                be deemed increased by the shortfall of 
                estimated social security revenues (including 
                social security revenues provided for in the 
                bill, resolution, amendment, or conference 
                report with respect to which this paragraph is 
                applied) below the appropriate level of social 
                security revenues specified in the most 
                recently adopted concurrent resolution on the 
                budget; and
                  (C) no provision of any bill or resolution, 
                or any amendment thereto or conference report 
                thereon, involving a change in chapter 1 of 
                Title 26 shall be treated as affecting the 
                amount of social security revenues unless such 
                provision changes the income tax treatment of 
                social security benefits.
        The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the 
        Senate may file with the Senate appropriately revised 
        allocations under subsection (a) of this section and 
        revised functional levels and aggregates to reflect the 
        application of the preceding sentence. Such revised 
        allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall be 
        considered as allocations, functional levels, and 
        aggregates contained in the most recently agreed to 
        concurrent resolution on the budget, and the 
        appropriate committees shall report revised allocations 
        pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
  (g) Determinations by Budget Committees.--For purposes of 
this section, the levels of new budget authority, spending 
authority as described in section 651(c)(2) of this title, 
outlays, and new credit authority for a fiscal year shall be 
determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on 
the Budget of the House of Representatives or the Senate, as 
the case may be.

SEC. 634. ADOPTION OF FIRST CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET PRIOR 
                    TO CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION PROVIDING NEW 
                    BUDGET AUTHORITY, NEW SPENDING AUTHORITY, NEW 
                    CREDIT AUTHORITY, OR CHANGES IN REVENUES OR PUBLIC 
                    DEBT LIMIT.

  (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in either the House 
of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint 
resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report as reported 
to the House or Senate which provides--
          (1) new budget authority for a fiscal year;
          (2) an increase or decrease in revenues to become 
        effective during a fiscal year;
          (3) an increase or decrease in the public debt limit 
        to become effective during a fiscal year;
          (4) new entitlement authority to become effective 
        during a fiscal year;
          (5) in the Senate only, new spending authority (as 
        defined in section 651(c)(2) of this title) for a 
        fiscal year; or
          (6) in the Senate only, outlays,
until the concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal 
year (or, in the Senate, a concurrent resolution on the budget 
covering such fiscal year) has been agreed to pursuant to 
section 632 of this title.
  (b) Exceptions.--
          (1) In the House of Representatives, subsection (a) 
        of this section does not apply to any bill or 
        resolution--
                  (A) providing new budget authority which 
                first becomes available in a fiscal year 
                following the fiscal year to which the 
                concurrent resolution applies; or
                  (B) increasing or decreasing revenues which 
                first become effective in a fiscal year 
                following the fiscal year to which the 
                concurrent resolution applies.
        After May 15 of any calendar year, subsection (a) of 
        this section does not apply in the House of 
        Representatives to any general appropriation bill, or 
        amendment thereto, which provides new budget authority 
        for the fiscal year beginning in such calendar year.
          (2) In the Senate, subsection (a) of this section 
        does not apply to any bill or resolution making advance 
        appropriations for the fiscal year to which the 
        concurrent resolution applies and the two succeeding 
        fiscal years.
  (c) Waiver in Senate.--
          (1) The committee of the Senate which reports any 
        bill or resolution (or amendment thereto) to which 
        subsection (a) of this section applies may at or after 
        the time it reports such bill or resolution (or 
        amendment), report a resolution to the Senate (A) 
        providing for the waiver of subsection (a) of this 
        section with respect to such bill or resolution (or 
        amendment), and (B) stating the reasons why the waiver 
        is necessary. The resolution shall then be referred to 
        the Committee on the Budget of the Senate. That 
        committee shall report the resolution to the Senate 
        within 10 days after the resolution is referred to it 
        (not counting any day on which the Senate is not in 
        session) beginning with the day following the day on 
        which it is so referred, accompanied by that 
        committee's recommendations and reasons for such 
        recommendations with respect to the resolution. If the 
        committee does not report the resolution within such 
        10-day period, it shall automatically be discharged 
        from further consideration of the resolution and the 
        resolution shall be placed on the calendar.
          (2) During the consideration of any such resolution, 
        debate shall be limited to one hour, to be equally 
        divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
        and minority leader or their designees, and the time on 
        any debatable motion or appeal shall be limited to 
        twenty minutes, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the mover and the manager of the 
        resolution. In the event the manager of the resolution 
        is in favor of any such motion or appeal, the time in 
        opposition thereto shall be controlled by the minority 
        leader or his designee. Such leaders, or either of 
        them, may, from the time under their control on the 
        passage of such resolution, allot additional time to 
        any Senator during the consideration of any debatable 
        motion or appeal. No amendment to the resolution is in 
        order.
          (3) If, after the Committee on the Budget has 
        reported (or been discharged from further consideration 
        of) the resolution, the Senate agrees to the 
        resolution, then subsection (a) of this section shall 
        not apply with respect to the bill or resolution (or 
        amendment thereto) to which the resolution so agreed to 
        applies.

SEC. 635. PERMISSIBLE REVISIONS OF CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS ON THE 
                    BUDGET.

  (a) In General.--At any time after the concurrent resolution 
on the budget for a fiscal year has been agreed to pursuant to 
section 632 of this title, and before the end of such fiscal 
year, the two Houses may adopt a concurrent resolution on the 
budget which revises or reaffirms the concurrent resolution on 
the budget for such fiscal year most recently agreed to.
  (b) Economic Assumptions.--The provisions of section 632(g) 
of this title shall apply with respect to concurrent 
resolutions on the budget under this section (and amendments 
thereto and conference reports thereon) in the same way they 
apply to concurrent resolutions on the budget under such 
section 632(g) of this title (and amendments thereto and 
conference reports thereon).

SEC. 636. CONSIDERATION OF CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS ON THE BUDGET.

  (a) Procedure in House of Representatives After Report of 
Committee; Debate.--
          (1) When the Committee on the Budget of the House of 
        Representatives has reported any concurrent resolution 
        on the budget, it is in order at any time after the 
        fifth day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
        holidays) following the day on which the report upon 
        such resolution by the Committee on the Budget has been 
        available to Members of the House and, if applicable, 
        after the first day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and 
        legal holidays) following the day on which a report 
        upon such resolution by the Committee on Rules pursuant 
        to section 632(c) of this title has been available to 
        Members of the House (even though a previous motion to 
        the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to 
        proceed to the consideration of the concurrent 
        resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not 
        debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order, 
        and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote 
        by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to.
          (2) General debate on any concurrent resolution on 
        the budget in the House of Representatives shall be 
        limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be 
        divided equally between the majority and minority 
        parties, plus such additional hours of debate as are 
        consumed pursuant to paragraph (3). A motion further to 
        limit debate is not debatable. A motion to recommit the 
        concurrent resolution is not in order, and it is not in 
        order to move to reconsider the vote by which the 
        concurrent resolution is agreed to or disagreed to.
          (3) Following the presentation of opening statements 
        on the concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal 
        year by the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
        Committee on the Budget of the House, there shall be a 
        period of up to four hours for debate on economic goals 
        and policies.
          (4) Only if a concurrent resolution on the budget 
        reported by the Committee on the Budget of the House 
        sets forth the economic goals (as described in sections 
        1022(a) and 1022a(b) of Title 15) which the estimates, 
        amounts, and levels (as described in section 632(a) of 
        this title) set forth in such resolution are designed 
        to achieve, shall it be in order to offer to such 
        resolution an amendment relating to such goals, and 
        such amendment shall be in order only if it also 
        proposes to alter such estimates, amounts, and levels 
        in germane fashion in order to be consistent with the 
        goals proposed in such amendment.
          (5) Consideration of any concurrent resolution on the 
        budget by the House of Representatives shall be in the 
        Committee of the Whole, and the resolution shall be 
        considered for amendment under the five-minute rule in 
        accordance with the applicable provisions of rule XXIII 
        of the Rules of the House of Representatives. After the 
        Committee rises and reports the resolution back to the 
        House, the previous question shall be considered as 
        ordered on the resolution and any amendments thereto to 
        final passage without intervening motion; except that 
        it shall be in order at any time prior to final passage 
        (notwithstanding any other rule or provision of law) to 
        adopt an amendment (or a series of amendments) changing 
        any figure or figures in the resolution as so reported 
        to the extent necessary to achieve mathematical 
        consistency.
          (6) Debate in the House of Representatives on the 
        conference report on any concurrent resolution on the 
        budget shall be limited to not more than 5 hours, which 
        shall be divided equally between the majority and 
        minority parties. A motion further to limit debate is 
        not debatable. A motion to recommit the conference 
        report is not in order, and it is not in order to move 
        to reconsider the vote by which the conference report 
        is agreed to or disagreed to.
          (7) Appeals from decisions of the Chair relating to 
        the application of the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives to the procedure relating to any 
        concurrent resolution on the budget shall be decided 
        without debate.
  (b) Procedure in Senate After Report of Committee; Debate; 
Amendments.--
          (1) Debate in the Senate on any concurrent resolution 
        on the budget, and all amendments thereto and debatable 
        motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be 
        limited to not more than 50 hours, except that with 
        respect to any concurrent resolution referred to in 
        section 635(a) of this title all such debate shall be 
        limited to not more than 15 hours. The time shall be 
        equally divided between, and controlled by, the 
        majority leader and the minority leader or their 
        designees.
          (2) Debate in the Senate on any amendment to a 
        concurrent resolution on the budget shall be limited to 
        2 hours, to be equally divided between, and controlled 
        by, the mover and the manager of the concurrent 
        resolution, and debate on any amendment to an 
        amendment, debatable motion, or appeal shall be limited 
        to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the mover and the manager of the 
        concurrent resolution, except that in the event the 
        manager of the concurrent resolution is in favor of any 
        such amendment, motion, or appeal, the time in 
        opposition thereto shall be controlled by the minority 
        leader or his designee. No amendment that is not 
        germane to the provisions of such concurrent resolution 
        shall be received. Such leaders, or either of them, 
        may, from the time under their control on the passage 
        of the concurrent resolution, allot additional time to 
        any Senator during the consideration of any amendment, 
        debatable motion, or appeal.
          (3) Following the presentation of opening statements 
        on the concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal 
        year by the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
        Committee on the Budget of the Senate, there shall be a 
        period of up to four hours for debate on economic goals 
        and policies.
          (4) Subject to the other limitations of this Act, 
        only if a concurrent resolution on the budget reported 
        by the Committee on the Budget of the Senate sets forth 
        the economic goals (as described in sections 1022(a)(2) 
        and 1022a(b) of Title 15) which the estimates, amounts, 
        and levels (as described in section 632(a) of this 
        title) set forth in such resolution are designed to 
        achieve, shall it be in order to offer to such 
        resolution an amendment relating to such goals, and 
        such amendment shall be in order only if it also 
        proposes to alter such estimates, amounts, and levels 
        in germane fashion in order to be consistent with the 
        goals proposed in such amendment.
          (5) A motion to further limit debate is not 
        debatable. A motion to recommit (except a motion to 
        recommit with instructions to report back within a 
        specified number of days, not to exceed 3, not counting 
        any day on which the Senate is not in session) is not 
        in order. Debate on any such motion to recommit shall 
        be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, 
        and controlled by, the mover and the manager of the 
        concurrent resolution.
          (6) Notwithstanding any other rule, an amendment or 
        series of amendments to a concurrent resolution on the 
        budget proposed in the Senate shall always be in order 
        if such amendment or series of amendments proposes to 
        change any figure or figures then contained in such 
        concurrent resolution so as to make such concurrent 
        resolution mathematically consistent or so as to 
        maintain such consistency.
  (c) Action on Conference Reports in the Senate.--
          (1) A motion to proceed to the consideration of the 
        conference report on any concurrent resolution on the 
        budget (or a reconciliation bill or resolution) may be 
        made even though a previous motion to the same effect 
        has been disagreed to.
          (2) During the consideration in the Senate of the 
        conference report (or a message between Houses) on any 
        concurrent resolution on the budget, and all amendments 
        in disagreement, and all amendments thereto, and 
        debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, 
        debate shall be limited to 10 hours, to be equally 
        divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
        and minority leader or their designees. Debate on any 
        debatable motion or appeal related to the conference 
        report (or a message between Houses) shall be limited 
        to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the mover and the manager of the 
        conference report (or a message between Houses).
          (3) Should the conference report be defeated, debate 
        on any request for a new conference and the appointment 
        of conferees shall be limited to 1 hour, to be equally 
        divided between, and controlled by, the manager of the 
        conference report and the minority leader or his 
        designee, and should any motion be made to instruct the 
        conferees before the conferees are named, debate on 
        such motion shall be limited to one-half hour, to be 
        equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover 
        and the manager of the conference report. Debate on any 
        amendment to any such instructions shall be limited to 
        20 minutes, to be equally divided between and 
        controlled by the mover and the manager of the 
        conference report. In all cases when the manager of the 
        conference report is in favor of any motion, appeal, or 
        amendment, the time in opposition shall be under the 
        control of the minority leader or his designee.
          (4) In any case in which there are amendments in 
        disagreement, time on each amendment shall be limited 
        to 30 minutes, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the manager of the conference report and 
        the minority leader or his designee. No amendment that 
        is not germane to the provisions of such amendments 
        shall be received.
  (d) Concurrent Resolution Must Be Consistent in Senate.--It 
shall not be in order in the Senate to vote on the question of 
agreeing to--
          (1) a concurrent resolution on the budget unless the 
        figures then contained in such resolution are 
        mathematically consistent; or
          (2) a conference report on a concurrent resolution on 
        the budget unless the figures contained in such 
        resolution, as recommended in such conference report, 
        are mathematically consistent.

SEC. 641. RECONCILIATION.

  (a) Inclusion of Reconciliation Directives in Concurrent 
Resolutions on the Budget.--A concurrent resolution on the 
budget for any fiscal year, to the extent necessary to 
effectuate the provisions and requirements of such resolution,

                within the jurisdiction of a committee, is to 
                be changed and direct that committee to 
                determine and recommend changes to accomplish a 
                change of such total amount;
          (2) specify the total amount by which revenues are to

                        concurrent resolution to recommend 
                        under such paragraph by more than 20 
                        percent of the total of the amounts of 
                        the changes such committee was directed 
                        to make under paragraphs (1) and (2) of

                        committee do not exceed or fall below 
                        the amount of the changes such

                        concurrent resolution to recommend 
                        under that paragraph by more than 20 
                        percent of the total of the amounts of 
                        the changes such committee was directed 
                        to make under paragraphs (1) and (2) of 
                        such subsection; and
                  (B) if the total amount of the changes 
                recommended by such committee is not less than 
                the total of the amounts of the changes such 
                committee was directed to make under paragraphs 
                (1) and (2) of such subsection.
          (2)(A) Upon the reporting to the Committee on the 
        Budget of the Senate of a recommendation that shall be 
        deemed to have complied with such directions solely by 
        virtue of this subsection, the chairman of that 
        committee may file with the Senate appropriately 
        revised allocations under section 633(a) of this title 
        and revised functional levels and aggregates to carry 
        out this subsection.
          (B) Upon the submission to the Senate of a conference 
        report recommending a reconciliation bill or resolution 
        in which a committee shall be deemed to have complied 
        with such directions solely by virtue of this 
        subsection, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget 
        of the Senate may file with the Senate appropriately 
        revised allocations under section 633(a) of this title 
        and revised functional levels and aggregates to carry 
        out this subsection.
          (C) Allocations, functional levels, and aggregates 
        revised pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered 
        to be allocations, functional levels, and aggregates 
        contained in the concurrent resolution on the budget 
        pursuant to section 632 of this title.
          (D) Upon the filing of revised allocations pursuant 
        to this paragraph, the reporting committee shall report 
        revised allocations pursuant to section 633(b) of this 
        title to carry out this subsection.
  (d) Limitation on Amendments to Reconciliation Bills and 
Resolutions.--
          (1) It shall not be in order in the House of 
        Representatives to consider any amendment to a 
        reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution if 
        such amendment would have the effect of increasing any 
        specific budget outlays above the level of such outlays 
        provided in the bill or resolution (for the fiscal 
        years covered by the reconciliation instructions set 
        forth in the most recently agreed to concurrent 
        resolution on the budget), or would have the effect of 
        reducing any specific Federal revenues below the level 
        of such revenues provided in the bill or resolution 
        (for such fiscal years), unless such amendment makes at 
        least an equivalent reduction in other specific budget 
        outlays, an equivalent increase in other specific 
        Federal revenues, or an equivalent combination thereof 
        (for such fiscal years), except that a motion to strike 
        a provision providing new budget authority or new 
        entitlement authority may be in order.
          (2) It shall not be in order in the Senate to 
        consider any amendment to a reconciliation bill or 
        reconciliation resolution if such amendment would have 
        the effect of decreasing any specific budget outlay 
        reductions below the level of such outlay reductions 
        provided (for the fiscal years covered) in the 
        reconciliation instructions which relate to such bill 
        or resolution set forth in a resolution providing for 
        reconciliation, or would have the effect of reducing 
        Federal revenue increases below the level of such 
        revenue increases provided (for such fiscal years) in 
        such instructions relating to such bill or resolution, 
        unless such amendment makes a reduction in other 
        specific budget outlays, an increase in other specific 
        Federal revenues, or a combination thereof (for such 
        fiscal years) at least equivalent to any increase in 
        outlays or decrease in revenues provided by such 
        amendment, except that a motion to strike a provision 
        shall always be in order.
          (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply if a 
        declaration of war by the Congress is in effect.
          (4) For purposes of this section, the levels of 
        budget outlays and Federal revenues for a fiscal year 
        shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by 
        the Committee on the Budget of the House of 
        Representatives or of the Senate, as the case may be.
          (5) The Committee on Rules of the House of 
        Representatives may make in order amendments to achieve 
        changes specified by reconciliation directives 
        contained in a concurrent resolution on the budget if a 
        committee or committees of the House fail to submit 
        recommended changes to its Committee on the Budget 
        pursuant to its instruction.
  (e) Procedure in Senate.--
          (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        provisions of section 636 of this title for the 
        consideration in the Senate of concurrent resolutions 
        on the budget and conference reports thereon shall also 
        apply to the consideration in the Senate of 
        reconciliation bills reported under subsection (b) of 
        this section and conference reports thereon.
          (2) Debate in the Senate on any reconciliation bill 
        reported under subsection (b) of this section, and all 
        amendments thereto and debatable motions and appeals in 
        connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 
        20 hours.
  (f) Completion of Reconciliation Process.--It shall not be in 
order in the House of Representatives to consider any 
resolution providing for an adjournment period of more than 
three calendar days during the month of July until the House of 
Representatives has completed action on the reconciliation 
legislation for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of the 
calendar year to which the adjournment resolution pertains, if 
reconciliation legislation is required to be reported by the 
concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year.
  (g) Limitation on Changes to Social Security Act.--
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, it shall not be in 
order in the Senate or the House of Representatives to consider 
any reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution reported 
pursuant to a concurrent resolution on the budget agreed to 
under section 632 or 635 of this title, or a joint resolution 
pursuant to section 907(d) of this title, or any amendment 
thereto or conference report thereon, that contains 
recommendations with respect to the old-age, survivors, and 
disability insurance program established under title II of the 
Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 401 et seq.].

SEC. 642. NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY, NEW SPENDING AUTHORITY, AND REVENUE 
                    LEGISLATION TO BE WITHIN APPROPRIATE LEVELS.

  (a) Legislation Subject to Point of Order.--
          (1) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this 
        section, after the Congress has completed action on a 
        concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, 
        it shall not be in order in either the House of 
        Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, 
        joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference 
        report providing new budget authority for such fiscal 
        year, providing new entitlement authority effective 
        during such fiscal year, or reducing revenues for such 
        fiscal year, if--
                  (A) the enactment of such bill or resolution 
                as reported;
                  (B) the adoption and enactment of such 
                amendment; or
                  (C) the enactment of such bill or resolution 
                in the form recommended in such conference 
                report;
        would cause the appropriate level of total new budget 
        authority or total budget outlays set forth in the most 
        recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget 
        for such fiscal year to be exceeded, or would cause 
        revenues to be less than the appropriate level of total 
        revenues set forth in such concurrent resolution except 
        in the case that a declaration of war by the Congress 
        is in effect.
          (2)(A) After the Congress has completed action on a 
        concurrent resolution on the budget, it shall not be in 
        order in the Senate to consider any bill, resolution, 
        amendment, motion, or conference report that would 
        cause the appropriate level of total new budget 
        authority or total budget outlays or social security 
        outlays set forth for the first fiscal year in the most 
        recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget 
        covering such fiscal year to be exceeded, or would 
        cause revenues to be less than the appropriate level of 
        total revenues (or social security revenues to be less 
        than the appropriate level of social security revenues) 
        set forth for the first fiscal year covered by the 
        resolution and for the period including the first 
        fiscal year plus the following 4 fiscal years in such 
        concurrent resolution.
          (B) In applying this paragraph--
                  (i)(I) estimated social security outlays 
                shall be deemed to be reduced by the excess of 
                estimated social security revenues (including 
                those provided for in the bill, resolution, 
                amendment, or conference report with respect to 
                which this subsection is applied) over the 
                appropriate level of Social Security revenues 
                specified in the most recently agreed to 
                concurrent resolution on the budget;
                  (II) estimated social security revenues shall 
                be deemed to be increased to the extent that 
                estimated social security outlays are less 
                (taking into account the effect of the bill, 
                resolution, amendment, or conference report to 
                which this subsection is being applied) than 
                the appropriate level of social security 
                outlays in the most recently agreed to 
                concurrent resolution on the budget; and
                  (ii)(I) estimated Social Security outlays 
                shall be deemed to be increased by the 
                shortfall of estimated social security revenues 
                (including Social Security revenues provided 
                for in the bill, resolution, amendment, or 
                conference report with respect to which this 
                subsection is applied) below the appropriate 
                level of social security revenues specified in 
                the most recently adopted concurrent resolution 
                on the budget; and
                  (II) estimated social security revenues shall 
                be deemed to be reduced by the excess of 
                estimated social security outlays (including 
                social security outlays provided for in the 
                bill, resolution, amendment, or conference 
                report with respect to which this subsection is 
                applied) above the appropriate level of social 
                security outlays specified in the most recently 
                adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; 
                and
                  (iii) no provision of any bill or resolution, 
                or any amendment thereto or conference report 
                thereon, involving a change in chapter 1 of 
                Title 26 shall be treated as affecting the 
                amount of social security revenues unless such 
                provision changes the income tax treatment of 
                social security benefits.
        The chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the 
        Senate may file with the Senate appropriately revised 
        allocations under section 633(a) of this title and 
        revised functional levels and aggregates to reflect the 
        application of the preceding sentence. Such revised 
        allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall be 
        considered as allocations, functional levels, and 
        aggregates contained in the most recently agreed to 
        concurrent resolution on the budget, and the 
        appropriate committees shall report revised allocations 
        pursuant to section 633(b) of this title.
  (b) Exception in House of Representatives.--Subsection (a) of 
this section shall not apply in the House of Representatives to 
any bill, resolution, or amendment which provides new budget 
authority or new entitlement authority effective during such 
fiscal year, or to any conference report on any such bill or 
resolution, if--
          (1) the enactment of such bill or resolution as 
        reported;
          (2) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or
          (3) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the 
        form recommended in such conference report, would not 
        cause the appropriate allocation of new discretionary 
        budget authority or new entitlement authority made 
        pursuant to section 633(a) of this title for such 
        fiscal year, for the committee within whose 
        jurisdiction such bill, resolution, or amendment falls, 
        to be exceeded.
  (c) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this 
section, the levels of new budget authority, budget outlays, 
new entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall 
be determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee 
on the Budget of the House of Representatives or of the Senate, 
as the case may be.

SEC. 643. EFFECTS OF POINTS OF ORDER.

  (a) Points of Order in the Senate Against Amendments Between 
the Houses.--Each provision of this Act that establishes a 
point of order against an amendment also establishes a point of 
order in the Senate against an amendment between the Houses. If 
a point of order under this Act is raised in the Senate against 
an amendment between the Houses, and the Presiding Officer 
sustains the point of order, the effect shall be the same as if 
the Senate had disagreed to the amendment.
  (b) Effect of a Point of Order on a Bill in the Senate.--In 
the Senate, if the Chair sustains a point of order under this 
Act against a bill, the Chair shall then send the bill to the 
committee of appropriate jurisdiction for further 
consideration.

SEC. 644. EXTRANEOUS MATTER IN RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION.

  (a) In General.--When the Senate is considering a 
reconciliation bill or a reconciliation resolution pursuant to 
section 641 of this title, (whether that bill or resolution 
originated in the Senate or the House) or section 907d of this 
title, upon a point of order being made by any Senator against 
material extraneous to the instructions to a committee which is 
contained in any title or provision of the bill or resolution 
or offered as an amendment to the bill or resolution, and the 
point of order is sustained by the Chair, any part of said 
title or provision that contains material extraneous to the 
instructions to said Committee as defined in subsection (b) of 
this section shall be deemed stricken from the bill and may not 
be offered as an amendment from the floor.
  (b) Extraneous Provisions.--
          (1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a 
        provision of a reconciliation bill or reconciliation 
        resolution considered pursuant to section 641 of this 
        title shall be considered extraneous if such provision 
        does not produce a change in outlays or revenues, 
        including changes in outlays and revenues brought about 
        by changes in the terms and conditions under which 
        outlays are made or revenues are required to be 
        collected (but a provision in which outlay decreases or 
        revenue increases exactly offset outlay increases or 
        revenue decreases shall not be considered extraneous by 
        virtue of this subparagraph); (B) any provision 
        producing an increase in outlays or decrease in 
        revenues shall be considered extraneous if the net 
        effect of provisions reported by the Committee 
        reporting the title containing the provision is that 
        the Committee fails to achieve its reconciliation 
        instructions; (C) a provision that is not in the 
        jurisdiction of the Committee with jurisdiction over 
        said title or provision shall be considered extraneous; 
        (D) a provision shall be considered extraneous if it 
        produces changes in outlays or revenues which are 
        merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of 
        the provision; (E) a provision shall be considered to 
        be extraneous if it increases, or would increase, net 
        outlays, or if it decreases, or would decrease, 
        revenues during a fiscal year after the fiscal years 
        covered by such reconciliation bill or reconciliation 
        resolution, and such increases or decreases are greater 
        than outlay reductions or revenue increases resulting 
        from other provisions in such title in such year; and 
        (F) a provision shall be considered extraneous if it 
        violates section 641(g) of this title.
          (2) A Senate-originated provision shall not be 
        considered extraneous under paragraph (1)(A) if the 
        Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee 
        on the Budget and the Chairman and Ranking Minority 
        Member of the Committee which reported the provision 
        certify that: (A) the provision mitigates direct 
        effects clearly attributable to a provision changing 
        outlays or revenues and both provisions together 
        produce a net reduction in the deficit; (B) the 
        provision will result in a substantial reduction in 
        outlays or a substantial increase in revenues during 
        fiscal years after the fiscal years covered by the 
        reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution; (C) a 
        reduction of outlays or an increase in revenues is 
        likely to occur as a result of the provision, in the 
        event of new regulations authorized by the provision or 
        likely to be proposed, court rulings on pending 
        litigation, or relationships between economic indices 
        and stipulated statutory triggers pertaining to the 
        provision, other than the regulations, court rulings or 
        relationships currently projected by the Congressional 
        Budget Office for scorekeeping purposes; or (D) such 
        provision will be likely to produce a significant 
        reduction in outlays or increase in revenues but, due 
        to insufficient data, such reduction or increase cannot 
        be reliably estimated.
          (3) A provision reported by a committee shall not be 
        considered extraneous under paragraph (1)(C) if (A) the 
        provision is an integral part of a provision or title, 
        which if introduced as a bill or resolution would be 
        referred to such committee, and the provision sets 
        forth the procedure to carry out or implement the 
        substantive provisions that were reported and which 
        fall within the jurisdiction of such committee; or (B) 
        the provision states an exception to, or a special 
        application of, the general provision or title of which 
        it is a part and such general provision or title if 
        introduced as a bill or resolution would be referred to 
        such committee.
  (c) Point of Order.--When the Senate is considering a 
conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in 
relation to, a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution 
pursuant to section 641 of this title, upon--
          (1) a point of order being made by any Senator 
        against extraneous material meeting the definition of 
        subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(D), (b)(1)(E), 
        or (b)(1)(F) of this section, and
          (2) such point of order being sustained,
such material contained in such conference report or amendment 
shall be deemed stricken, and the Senate shall proceed, without 
intervening action or motion, to consider the question of 
whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and concur 
with a further amendment, or concur in the House amendment with 
a further amendment, as the case may be, which further 
amendment shall consist of only that portion of the conference 
report or House amendment, as the case may be, not so stricken. 
Any such motion in the Senate shall be debatable for two hours. 
In any case in which such point of order is sustained against a 
conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such 
conference report by operation of this subsection) no further 
amendment shall be in order.
  (d) Extraneous Materials.--Upon the reporting or discharge of 
a reconciliation bill or resolution pursuant to section 641 of 
this title in the Senate, and again upon the submission of a 
conference report on such a reconciliation bill or resolution, 
the Committee on the Budget of the Senate shall submit for the 
record a list of material considered to be extraneous under 
subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of this section 
to the instructions of a committee as provided in this section. 
The inclusion or exclusion of a provision shall not constitute 
a determination of extraneousness by the Presiding Officer of 
the Senate.
  (e) General Point of Order.--Notwithstanding any other law or 
rule of the Senate, it shall be in order for a Senator to raise 
a single point of order that several provisions of a bill, 
resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report violate 
this section. The Presiding Officer may sustain the point of 
order as to some or all of the provisions against which the 
Senator raised the point of order. If the Presiding Officer so 
sustains the point of order as to some of the provisions 
(including provisions of an amendment, motion, or conference 
report) against which the Senator raised the point of order, 
then only those provisions (including provisions of an 
amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the 
Presiding Officer sustains the point of order shall be deemed 
stricken pursuant to this section. Before the Presiding Officer 
rules on such a point of order, any Senator may move to waive 
such a point of order as it applies to some or all of the 
provisions against which the point of order was raised. Such a 
motion to waive is amendable in accordance with the rules and 
precedents of the Senate. After the Presiding Officer rules on 
such a point of order, any Senator may appeal the ruling of the 
Presiding Officer on such a point of order as it applies to 
some or all of the provisions on which the Presiding Officer 
ruled.
  (f) Determination of Levels.--For purposes of this section, 
the levels of new budget authority, budget outlays, new 
entitlement authority, and revenues for a fiscal year shall be 
determined on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on 
the Budget of the Senate.

                    Subchapter II--Fiscal Procedures

                       PART A--GENERAL PROVISIONS

SEC. 651. BILLS PROVIDING NEW SPENDING AUTHORITY.

  (a) Controls on Legislation Providing Spending Authority.--It 
shall not be order in either the House of Representatives or 
the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, 
motion, or conference report, as reported to its House which 
provides new spending authority described in subsection 
(c)(2)(A) or (B) of this section, unless that bill, resolution, 
conference report, or amendment also provides that such new 
spending authority as described in subsection (c)(2)(A) or (B) 
of this section is to be effective for any fiscal year only to 
such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation 
Acts.
  (b) Legislation Providing Entitlement Authority.--
          (1) It shall not be in order in either the House of 
        Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, 
        joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference 
        report, as reported to its House which provides new 
        spending authority described in subsection (c)(2)(C) of 
        this section which is to become effective before the 
        first day of the fiscal year which begins during the 
        calendar year in which such bill or resolution is 
        reported.
          (2) If any committee of the House of Representatives 
        or the Senate reports any bill or resolution which 
        provides new spending authority described in subsection 
        (c)(2)(C) of this section which is to become effective 
        during a fiscal year and the amount of new budget 
        authority which will be required for such fiscal year 
        if such bill or resolution is enacted as so reported 
        exceeds the appropriate allocation of new budget 
        authority reported under section 633(b) of this title

have access to all agency data that may facilitate the 
development and improvement of estimates of costs.

aggregate historical budget data to credit reform accounting.
  (f) Administrative Costs.--The Director and the Director of 
the Congressional Budget Office shall each analyze and report 
to Congress on differences in long-term administrative costs 
for credit programs versus grant programs by January 31, 1992. 
Their reports shall recommend to Congress any changes, if 
necessary, in the treatment of administrative costs under 
credit reform accounting.

SEC. 661C. BUDGETARY TREATMENT.

  (a) President's Budget.--Beginning with fiscal year 1992, the

loan guarantee programs. The budget shall also include the 
planned level of new direct loan obligations or loan guarantee 
commitments associated with each appropriations request.
  (b) Appropriations Required.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, new direct loan obligations may be incurred 
and new loan guarantee commitments may be made for fiscal year 
1992 and thereafter only to the extent that--
          (1) appropriations of budget authority to cover their 
        costs are made in advance;
          (2) a limitation on the use of funds otherwise 
        available for the cost of a direct loan or loan 
        guarantee program is enacted; or
          (3) authority is otherwise provided in appropriation 
        Acts.
  (c) Exemption for Mandatory Programs.--Subsection (b) of this 
section shall not apply to a direct loan or loan guarantee 
program that--
          (1) constitutes an entitlement (such as the 
        guaranteed student loan program or the veterans' home 
        loan guaranty program); or
          (2) all existing credit programs of the Commodity 
        Credit Corporation on November 5, 1990.
  (d) Budget Accounting.--
          (1) The authority to incur new direct loan 
        obligations, make new loan guarantee commitments, or 
        directly or indirectly alter the costs of outstanding 
        direct loans and loan guarantees shall constitute new 
        budget authority in an amount equal to the cost of the 
        direct loan or loan guarantee in the fiscal year in 
        which definite authority becomes available or 
        indefinite authority is used. Such budget authority 
        shall constitute an obligation of the credit program 
        account to pay to the financing account.
          (2) The outlays resulting from new budget authority 
        for the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees 
        described in paragraph (1) shall be paid from the 
        credit program account into the financing account and 
        recorded in the fiscal year in which the direct loan or 
        the guaranteed loan is disbursed or its costs altered.
          (3) All collections and payments of the financing 
        accounts shall be a means of financing.
  (e) Modifications.--A direct loan obligation or loan 
guarantee commitment shall not be modified in a manner that 
increases its cost unless budget authority for the additional 
cost is appropriated, or is available out of existing 
appropriations or from other budgetary resources.
  (f) Reestimates.--When the estimated cost for a group of 
direct loans or loan guarantees for a given credit program made 
in a single fiscal year is reestimated in a subsequent year, 
the difference between the reestimated cost and the previous 
cost estimate shall be displayed as a distinct and separately 
identified subaccount in the credit program account as a change 
in program costs and a change in net interest. There is hereby 
provided permanent indefinite authority for these reestimates.
  (g) Administrative Expenses.--All funding for an agency's 
administration of a direct loan or loan guarantee program shall 
be displayed as distinct and separately identified subaccounts 
within the same budget account as the program's cost.

Expenses.--There are authorized to be appropriated to existing 
accounts such sums as may be necessary for salaries and 
expenses to carry out the responsibilities under this 
subchapter.
  (f) Reinsurance.--Nothing in this subchapter shall be 
construed as authorizing or requiring the purchase of insurance 
or reinsurance on a direct loan or loan guarantee from private 
insurers. If any such reinsurance for a direct loan or loan 
guarantee is authorized, the cost of such insurance and any 
recoveries to the Government shall be included in the 
calculation of the cost.
  (g) Eligibility and Assistance.--Nothing in this subchapter

        the accounting for Federal deposit insurance programs 
        should be on a cash basis on the same basis as loan 
        guarantees, or on a different basis. Each Director 
        shall report findings and recommendations to the 
        President and the Congress on or before May 31, 1991.

        soon as practicable after a budget resolution is agreed

        (after consulting with the Committee on Appropriations 
        of the other House) shall suballocate each amount 
        allocated to it for the budget year under subsection 
        (a)(1)(A) or (a)(2) of this section among its

applicable, for the fiscal year of the resolution or for the 
total of all fiscal years made by the joint explanatory 
statement accompanying the applicable concurrent resolution on

        reported;
          (2) the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or
          (3) the enactment of such bill or resolution in the 
        form recommended in such conference report,

if the sum of any revenue increases provided in legislation 
already enacted during the current session (when added to 
revenue increases, if any, in excess of any outlay increase 
provided by the legislation proposed for consideration) is at 
least as great as the sum of the amount, if any, by which the 
aggregate level of Federal revenues should be increased as set 
forth in that concurrent resolution and the amount, if any, by 
which revenues are to be increased pursuant to pay-as-you-go 
procedures under section 632(b)(8) of this title if included in 
that concurrent resolution.
          (2) Revised allocations.--
                  (A) As soon as practicable after Congress 
                agrees to a bill or joint resolution that would 
                have been subject to a point of order under 
                section 633(f)(1) of this title but for the 
                exception provided in paragraph (1), the 
                chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the 
                House of Representatives may file with the 
                House appropriately revised allocations under 
                section 633(a) of this title and revised

                reflect that bill.
                  (B) such revised allocations, functional 
                levels, and budget aggregates shall be 
                considered for the purposes of this Act as 
                allocations, functional levels, and budget 
                aggregates contained in the most recently 
                agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget.

Representatives.--If legislation providing for a net reduction 
in revenues in any fiscal year (that, within the same measure, 
is not fully offset in that fiscal year by reductions in direct 
spending) is enacted, the Committee on the Budget of the House 
of Representatives may report, within 15 legislative days 
during a Congress, a pay-as-you-go reconciliation directive in 
the form of a concurrent resolution--
          (1) specifying the total amount by which revenues 
        sufficient to eliminate the net deficit increase 
        resulting from that legislation in each fiscal year are 
        to be changed; and
          (2) directing that the committees having jurisdiction 
        determine and recommend changes in the revenue law, 
        bills, and resolutions to accomplish a change of such 
        total amount.

        budget outlays or appropriate level of total revenues 
        set forth in the most recently agreed to concurrent 
        resolution on the budget for a fiscal year shall be 
        deemed to be a reference to the appropriate level for 
        that fiscal year and to the total of the appropriate 
        level for that year and the 4 succeeding years.
          (2) In the Senate, in the application of section

        level for that fiscal year and to the total of the 
        appropriate levels for that year and the 4 succeeding 
        years.

covered by that resolution that exceeds the maximum deficit 
amount specified for such fiscal year in section 655(a) of this 
title.

the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of the calendar year in 
which it is reported and for each of the 4 succeeding fiscal 
years for the matters described in section 632(a) of this 
title.
  (b) Point of Order in the House of Representatives.--It shall 
not be in order in the House of Representatives to consider any 
concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year or 
conference report thereon under section 632 or 635 of this 
title that exceeds the maximum deficit amount for each fiscal 
year covered by the concurrent resolution or conference report 
as determined under section 665(a) of this title, including 
possible revisions under part C of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 900 et 
seq.].
  (c) Point of Order in the Senate.--It shall not be in order 
in the Senate to consider any concurrent resolution on the 
budget for a fiscal year under section 632 of this title, or to 
consider any amendment to such a concurrent resolution, or to 
consider a conference report on such a concurrent resolution, 
if the level of total budget outlays for the first fiscal year 
that is set forth in such concurrent resolution or conference 
report exceeds the recommended level of Federal revenues set 
forth for that year by an amount that is greater than the 
maximum deficit amount for such fiscal year as determined under 
section 665(a) of this title or if the adoption of such 
amendment would result in a level of total budget outlays for 
that fiscal year which exceeds the recommended level of Federal 
revenues for that fiscal year, by an amount that is greater 
than the maximum deficit amount for such fiscal years as 
determined under section 665(a) of this title.
  (d) Adjustments.--
          (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
        concurrent resolutions on the budget for fiscal years 
        1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 under section 632 or 635 of 
        this title may set forth levels consistent with 
        allocations increased by--
                  (A) amounts not to exceed the budget 
                authority amounts in section 251(b)(2)(E) (i) 
                and (ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
                Deficit Control Act of 1985 [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 
                901(b)(2)(E) (i) and (ii)] and the composite 
                outlays per category consistent with them; and
                  (B) the budget authority and outlay amounts 
                in section 251(b)(1) of that Act [2 U.S.C.A. 
                Sec. 901(b)(1)].
          (2) For purposes of congressional consideration of 
        provisions described in sections 251(b)(2)(A), 
        251(b)(2)(B), 251(b)(2)(C), 251(b)(2)(D), and 252(e), 
        determinations under sections 633, 634, and 642 of this 
        title shall not take into account any new budget 
        authority, new entitlement authority, outlays, 
        receipts, or deficit effects in any fiscal year of 
        those provisions.

SEC. 683. RESCISSION OF BUDGET AUTHORITY.

  (a) Transmittal of special message.--Whenever the President 
determines that all or part of any budget authority will not be 
required to carry out the full objectives or scope of programs 
for which it is provided or that such budget authority should 
be rescinded for fiscal policy or other reasons (including the 
termination of authorized projects or activities for which 
budget authority has been provided), or whenever all or part of 
budget authority provided for only one fiscal year is to be 
reserved from obligation for such fiscal year, the President 
shall transmit to both Houses of Congress a special message 
specifying--
          (1) the amount of budget authority which he proposes 
        to be rescinded or which is to be so reserved;
          (2) any account, department, or establishment of the 
        Government to which such budget authority is available 
        for obligation, and the specific project or 
        governmental functions involved;
          (3) the reasons why the budget authority should be 
        rescinded or is to be so reserved;
          (4) to the maximum extent practicable, the estimated 
        fiscal, economic, and budgetary effect of the proposed 
        rescission or of the reservation; and
          (5) all facts, circumstances, and considerations 
        relating to or bearing upon the proposed rescission or 
        the reservation and the decision to effect the proposed 
        rescission or the reservation, and to the maximum 
        extent practicable, the estimated effect of the 
        proposed rescission or the reservation upon the 
        objects, purposes, and programs for which the budget 
        authority is provided.
  (b) Requirement To Make Available for Obligation.--Any amount 
of budget authority proposed to be rescinded or that is to be 
reserved as set forth in such special message shall be made 
available for obligation unless, within the prescribed 45-day 
period, the Congress has completed action on a rescission bill 
rescinding all or part of the amount proposed to be rescinded 
or that is to be reserved. Funds made available for obligation 
under this procedure may not be proposed for rescission again.

SEC. 684. PROPOSED DEFERRALS OF BUDGET AUTHORITY.

  (a) Transmittal of Special Message.--Whenever the President, 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the head 
of any department or agency of the United States, or any 
officer or employee of the United States proposes to defer any 
budget authority provided for a specific purpose or project, 
the President shall transmit to the House of Representatives 
and the Senate a special message specifying--
          (1) the amount of the budget authority proposed to be 
        deferred;
          (2) any account, department, or establishment of the 
        Government to which such budget authority is available 
        for obligation, and the specific projects or 
        governmental functions involved;
          (3) the period of time during which the budget 
        authority is proposed to be deferred;
          (4) the reasons for the proposed deferral, including 
        any legal authority invoked to justify the proposed 
        deferral;
          (5) to the maximum extent practicable, the estimated 
        fiscal, economic, and budgetary effect of the proposed 
        deferral; and
          (6) all facts, circumstances, and considerations 
        relating to or bearing upon the proposed deferral and 
        the decision to effect the proposed deferral, including 
        an analysis of such facts, circumstances, and 
        considerations in terms of their application to any 
        legal authority, including specific elements of legal 
        authority, invoked to justify such proposed deferral, 
        and to the maximum extent practicable, the estimated 
        effect of the proposed deferral upon the objects, 
        purposes, and programs for which the budget authority 
        is provided.
A special message may include one or more proposed deferrals of 
budget authority. A deferral may not be proposed for any period 
of time extending beyond the end of the fiscal year in which 
the special message proposing the deferral is transmitted to 
the House and the Senate.
  (b) Consistency With Legislative Policy.--Deferrals shall be 
permissible only--
          (1) to provide for contingencies;
          (2) to achieve savings made possible by or through 
        changes in requirements or greater efficiency of 
        operations; or
          (3) as specifically provided by law.
No officer or employee of the United States may defer any 
budget authority for any other purpose.
  (c) Exception.--The provisions of this section do not apply 
to any budget authority proposed to be rescinded or that is to 
be reserved as set forth in a special message required to be 
transmitted under section 683 of this title.

SEC. 685. TRANSMISSION OF MESSAGES; PUBLICATION.

  (a) Delivery to House and Senate.--Each special message

shall be transmitted to the Comptroller General on the same day 
it is transmitted to the House of Representatives and the

functions under sections 683 and 684 of this title, the 
Comptroller General shall review each such message and inform 
the House of Representatives and the Senate as promptly as 
practicable with respect to--
          (1) in the case of a special message transmitted 
        under section 683 of this title, the facts surrounding 
        the proposed rescission or the reservation of budget 
        authority (including the probable effects thereof); and
          (2) in the case of a special message transmitted 
        under section 684 of this title, (A) the facts 
        surrounding each proposed deferral of budget authority 
        (including the probable effects thereof) and (B) 
        whether or not (or to what extent), in his judgment, 
        such proposed deferral is in accordance with existing 
        statutory authority.
    (c) Transmission of Supplementary Messages.--If any 
information contained in a special message transmitted under 
section 683 or 684 of this title is subsequently revised, the 
President shall transmit to both Houses of Congress and the 
Comptroller General a supplementary message stating and 
explaining such revision. Any such supplementary message shall 
be delivered, referred, and printed as provided in subsection 
(a) of this section. The Comptroller General shall promptly 
notify the House of Representatives and the Senate of any 
changes in the information submitted by him under subsection 
(b) of this section which may be necessitated by such revision.
  (d) Printing in Federal Register.--Any special message 
transmitted under section 683 or 684 of this title, and any

Register published after such transmittal.
  (e) Cumulative Reports of Proposed Rescissions, Reservations, 
and Deferrals of Budget Authority.--
          (1) The President shall submit a report to the House 
        of Representatives and the Senate, not later than the 
        10th day of each month during a fiscal year, listing 
        all budget authority for that fiscal year with respect 
        to which, as of the first day of such month--
                  (A) he has transmitted a special message 
                under section 683 of this title with respect to 
                a proposed rescission or a reservation; and
                  (B) he has transmitted a special message 
                under section 684 of this title proposing a 
                deferral.
        Such report shall also contain, with respect to each 
        such proposed rescission or deferral, or each such 
        reservation, the information required to be submitted 
        in the special message with respect thereto under 
        section 683 or 684 of this title.
          (2) Each report submitted under paragraph (1) shall 
        be printed in the first issue of the Federal Register 
        published after its submission.

SEC. 686. REPORTS BY COMPTROLLER GENERAL.

  (a) Failure To Transmit Special Message.--If the Comptroller 
General finds that the President, the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, the head of any department or agency of 
the United States, or any other officer or employee of the 
United States--
          (1) is to establish a reserve or proposes to defer 
        budget authority with respect to which the President is 
        required to transmit a special message under section 
        683 or 684 of this title; or
          (2) has ordered, permitted, or approved the 
        establishment of such a reserve or a deferral of budget 
        authority;
and that the President has failed to transmit a special message 
with respect to such reserve or deferral, the Comptroller 
General shall make a report on such reserve or deferral and any 
available information concerning it to both Houses of Congress. 
The provisions of sections 682 to 688 of this title shall apply 
with respect to such reserve or deferral in the same manner and 
with the same effect as if such report of the Comptroller 
General were a special message transmitted by the President 
under section 683 or 684 of this title, and, for purposes of 
sections 682 to 688 of this title, such report shall be 
considered a special message transmitted under section 683 or 
684 of this title.
  (b) Incorrect Classification of Special Message.--If the 
President has transmitted a special message to both Houses of 
Congress in accordance with section 683 or 684 of this title, 
and the Comptroller General believes that the President so 
transmitted the special message in accordance with one of those 
sections when the special message should have been transmitted 
in accordance with the other of those sections, the Comptroller 
General shall make a report to both Houses of the Congress 
setting forth his reasons.

SEC. 687. SUITS BY COMPTROLLER GENERAL.

  If, under this chapter, budget authority is required to be 
made available for obligation and such budget authority is not 
made available for obligation, the Comptroller General is 
hereby expressly empowered, through attorneys of his own 
selection, to bring a civil action in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia to require such 
budget authority to be made available for obligation, and such 
court is hereby expressly empowered to enter in such civil 
action, against any department, agency, officer or employee of 
the United States, any decree, judgment, or order which may be 
necessary or appropriate to make such budget authority 
available for obligation. No civil action shall be brought by 
the Comptroller General under this section until the expiration 
of 25 calendar days of continuous session of the Congress 
following the date on which an explanatory statement by the 
Comptroller General of the circumstances giving rise to the 
action contemplated has been filed with the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives and the President of the Senate.

SEC. 688. PROCEDURE IN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND SENATE.

  (a) Referral.--Any rescission bill introduced with respect to 
a special message or impoundment resolution introduced with 
respect to a proposed deferral of budget authority shall be 
referred to the appropriate committee of the House of 
Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be.
  (b) Discharge of Committee.--
          (1) If the committee to which a rescission bill or 
        impoundment resolution has been referred has not 
        reported it at the end of 25 calendar days of 
        continuous session of the Congress after its 
        introduction, it is in order to move either to 
        discharge the committee from further consideration of 
        the bill or resolution or to discharge the committee 
        from further consideration of any other rescission bill 
        with respect to the same special message or impoundment 
        resolution with respect to the same proposed deferral, 
        as the case may be, which has been referred to the 
        committee.
          (2) A motion to discharge may be made only by an 
        individual favoring the bill or resolution, may be made 
        only if supported by one-fifth of the Members of the 
        House involved (a quorum being present), and is highly 
        privileged in the House and privileged in the Senate 
        (except that it may not be made after the committee has 
        reported a bill or resolution with respect to the same 
        special message or the same proposed deferral, as the 
        case may be); and debate thereon shall be limited to 
        not more than 1 hour, the time to be divided in the 
        House equally between those favoring and those opposing 
        the bill or resolution, and to be divided in the Senate 
        equally between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
        and the minority leader or their designees. An 
        amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not 
        in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the 
        motion is agreed to or disagreed to.
  (c) Floor Consideration in the House.--
          (1) When the committee of the House of 
        Representatives has reported, or has been discharged 
        from further consideration of, a rescission bill or 
        impoundment resolution, it shall at any time thereafter 
        be in order (even though a previous motion to the same 
        effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the 
        consideration of the bill or resolution. The motion 
        shall be highly privileged and not debatable. An 
        amendment to the motion shall not be in order, nor 
        shall it be in order to move to reconsider the vote by 
        which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to.
          (2) Debate on a rescission bill or impoundment 
        resolution shall be limited to not more than 2 hours, 
        which shall be divided equally between those favoring 
        and those opposing the bill or resolution. A motion 
        further to limit debate shall not be debatable. In the 
        case of an impoundment resolution, no amendment to, or 
        motion to recommit, the resolution shall be in order. 
        It shall not be in order to move to reconsider the vote 
        by which a rescission bill or impoundment resolution is 
        agreed to or disagreed to.
          (3) Motions to postpone, made with respect to the 
        consideration of a rescission bill or impoundment 
        resolution, and motions to proceed to the consideration 
        of other business, shall be decided without debate.
          (4) All appeals from the decisions of the Chair 
        relating to the application of the Rules of the House 
        of Representatives to the procedure relating to any 
        rescission bill or impoundment resolution shall be 
        decided without debate.
          (5) Except to the extent specifically provided in the 
        preceding provisions of this subsection, consideration 
        of any rescission bill or impoundment resolution and 
        amendments thereto (or any conference report thereon) 
        shall be governed by the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives applicable to other bills and 
        resolutions, amendments, and conference reports in 
        similar circumstances.
  (d) Floor Consideration in the Senate.--
          (1) Debate in the Senate on any rescission bill or 
        impoundment resolution, and all amendments thereto (in 
        the case of a rescission bill) and debatable motions 
        and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited 
        to not more than 10 hours. The time shall be equally 
        divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
        and the minority leader or their designees.
          (2) Debate in the Senate on any amendment to a 
        rescission bill shall be limited to 2 hours, to be 
        equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover 
        and the manager of the bill. Debate on any amendment to 
        an amendment, to such a bill, and debate on any 
        debatable motion or appeal in connection with such a 
        bill or an impoundment resolution shall be limited to 1 
        hour, to be equally divided between, and controlled by, 
        the mover and the manager of the bill or resolution, 
        except that in the event the manager of the bill or 
        resolution is in favor of any such amendment, motion, 
        or appeal, the time in opposition thereto, shall be 
        controlled by the minority leader or his designee. No 
        amendment that is not germane to the provisions of a 
        rescission bill shall be received. Such leaders, or 
        either of them, may, from the time under their control 
        on the passage of a rescission bill or impoundment 
        resolution, allot additional time to any Senator during 
        the consideration of any amendment, debatable motion, 
        or appeal.
          (3) A motion to further limit debate is not 
        debatable. In the case of a rescission bill, a motion 
        to recommit (except a motion to recommit with 
        instructions to report back within a specified number 
        of days, not to exceed 3, not counting any day on which 
        the Senate is not in session) is not in order. Debate

        shall be in order in the Senate at any time after the 
        third day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
        holidays) following the day on which such a conference 
        report is reported and is available to Members of the 
        Senate. A motion to proceed to the consideration of the 
        conference report may be made even though a previous 
        motion to the same effect has been disagreed to.
          (5) During the consideration in the Senate of the 
        conference report on any rescission bill, debate shall 
        be limited to 2 hours, to be equally divided between,

        leader or their designees. Debate on any debatable 
        motion or appeal related to the conference report shall 
        be limited to 30 minutes, to be equally divided 
        between, and controlled by, the mover and the manager 
        of the conference report.
          (6) Should the conference report be defeated, debate 
        on any request for a new conference and the appointment 
        of conferees shall be limited to one hour, to be 
        equally divided between, and controlled by, the manager 
        of the conference report and the minority leader or his 
        designee, and should any motion be made to instruct the 
        conferees before the conferees are named, debate on 
        such motion shall be limited to 30 minutes, to be 
        equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover 
        and the manager of the conference report. Debate on any

        20 minutes, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the mover and the manager of the 
        conference report. In all cases when the manager of the 
        conference report is in favor of any motion, appeal, or 
        amendment, the time in opposition shall be under the 
        control of the minority leader or his designee.
          (7) In any case in which there are amendments in 
        disagreement, time on each amendment shall be limited 
        to 30 minutes, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the manager of the conference report and 
        the minority leader or his designee. No amendment that 
        is not germane to the provisions of such amendments 
        shall be received.

                             Budget Control

  By the authority vested in me as President of the United 
States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, including section 1105 of title 31, United States Code 
[section 1105 of Title 31, Money and Finance], it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
  Section 1.--Purpose. The purpose of this order is to create a 
mechanism to monitor total costs of direct spending programs, 
and, in the event that actual or projected costs exceed 
targeted levels, to require that the budget address adjustments 
in direct spending.
    Sec. 2.--Establishment of Direct Spending Targets.
  (a) In General.--The initial direct spending targets for each 
of fiscal years 1994 through 1997 shall equal total outlays for 
all direct spending except net interest and deposit insurance 
as determined by the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget (Director) under subsection (b).
  (b) Initial Report by Director.--(1) Not later than 30 days 
after the date of enactment of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA) [Aug. 10, 1993], the Director 
shall submit a report to the Congress setting forth projected 
direct spending targets for each of fiscal years 1994 through 
1997.
  (2) The Director's projections shall be based on legislation 
enacted as of 5 days before the report is submitted under 
paragraph (1). To the extent feasible, the Director shall use 
the same economic and technical assumptions used in preparing 
the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1994 
(H.Con.Res. 64).
  (c) Adjustments. Direct spending targets shall be 
subsequently adjusted by the Director under Section 6.
    Sec. 3. Annual Review of Direct Spending and Receipts by 
President. As part of each budget submitted under section 
1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the Director shall 
provide an annual review of direct spending and receipts, which 
shall include (1) information supporting the adjustment of 
direct spending targets pursuant to Section 6, (2) information 
on total outlays for programs covered by the direct spending 
targets, including actual outlays for the prior fiscal year and 
projected outlays for the current fiscal year and the 5 
succeeding fiscal years, and (3) information on the major 
categories of Federal receipts, including a comparison between 
the levels of those receipts and the levels projected as of the 
date of enactment of OBRA [Aug. 10, 1993].
    Sec. 4. Special Direct Spending Message by President. (a) 
Trigger.--In the event that the information submitted under 
Section 3 indicates--
          (1) that actual outlays for direct spending in the 
        prior fiscal year exceeded the applicable direct 
        spending target, or
          (2) that outlays for direct spending for the current 
        or budget year are projected to exceed the applicable 
        direct spending targets, the Director shall include in 
        the budget a special direct spending message meeting 
        the requirements of subsection (b) of this Section.
  (b) Contents.--(1) The special direct spending message shall 
include:
          (A) An explanation of any adjustments to the direct 
        spending targets pursuant to Section 6.
          (B) An analysis of the variance in direct spending 
        over the adjusted direct spending targets.
          (C) The President's recommendations for addressing 
        the direct spending overages, if any, in the prior, 
        current, or budget year.
  (2) The recommendations may consist of any of the following:
          (A) Proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays, 
        increase revenues, or both, in order to recoup or 
        eliminate the overage for the prior, current, and 
        budget years in the current year, the budget year, and 
        the 4 out-years.
          (B) Proposed legislative changes to reduce outlays, 
        increase revenues, or both, in order to recoup or 
        eliminate part of the overage for the prior, current, 
        and budget year in the current year, the budget year, 
        and the 4 out-years, accompanied by a finding by the 
        President that, because of economic conditions or for 
        other specified reasons, only some of the overage 
        should be recouped or eliminated by outlay reductions 
        or revenue increases, or both.
          (C) A proposal to make no legislative changes to 
        recoup or eliminate any overage, accompanied by a 
        finding by the President that, because of economic 
        conditions or for other specified reasons, no 
        legislative changes are warranted.
  (3) Any proposed legislative change under paragraph (2) to 
reduce outlays may include reductions in direct spending or in 
the discretionary spending limits under section 601 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 [section 665 of this title].
    Sec. 5. Proposed Special Direct Spending Resolution. If the 
President recommends reductions consistent with subsection 
4(b)(2)(A) or (B), the special direct spending message shall 
include the text of a special direct spending resolution 
implementing the President's recommendations through 
reconciliation directives instructing the appropriate 
committees of the House of Representatives and Senate to 
determine and recommend changes in laws within their 
jurisdictions to reduce outlays or increase revenues by 
specified amounts. If the President recommends no reductions 
pursuant to Section 4(b)(2)(C), the special direct spending 
message shall include the text of a special resolution 
concurring in the President's recommendation of no legislative 
action.
    Sec. 6. Adjustments to Direct Spending Targets.
  (a) Required Annual Adjustments.--Prior to the submission of 
the President's budget for each of fiscal years 1995 through 
1997, the Director shall adjust the direct spending targets in 
accordance with this Section. Any such adjustments shall be 
reflected in the targets used in the report under Section 3 and 
message (if any) under Section 4.
  (b) Adjustment for Increases in Beneficiaries.--(1) The 
Director shall adjust the direct spending targets for increases 
(if any) in actual or projected numbers of beneficiaries under 
direct spending programs for which the number of beneficiaries 
is a variable in determining costs.
  (2) The adjustment shall be made by--
          (A) computing, for each program under paragraph (1), 
        the percentage change between (i) the annual average 
        number of beneficiaries under that program (including 
        actual numbers of beneficiaries for the prior fiscal 
        year and projections for the budget and subsequent 
        fiscal years) to be used in the President's budget with 
        which the adjustments will be submitted, and (ii) the 
        annual average number of beneficiaries used in the 
        adjustments made by the Director in the previous year 
        (or, in the case of adjustments made in 1994, the 
        annual average number of beneficiaries used in the 
        Director's initial report under Section 2(b));
          (B) applying the percentages computed under 
        subparagraph (A) to the projected levels of outlays for 
        each program consistent with the direct spending 
        targets in effect immediately prior to the adjustment; 
        and
          (C) adding the results of the calculations required 
        by subparagraph (B) to the direct spending targets in 
        effect immediately prior to the adjustment.
  (3) No adjustment shall be made for any program for a fiscal 
year in which the percentage increase computed under paragraph 
(2)(A) is less than or equal to zero.
  (c) Adjustments for Revenue Legislation.--The Director shall 
adjust the targets as follows:
          (1) they shall be increased by the amount of any 
        increase in receipts; or
          (2) they shall be decreased by the amount of any 
        decrease in receipts, resulting from receipts 
        legislation enacted after the date of enactment of OBRA 
        [Aug. 10, 1993], except legislation enacted in response 
        to the message transmitted under Section 4.
  (d) Adjustments To Reflect Congressional Decisions.--Upon 
enactment of a reconciliation bill enacted in response to a 
message submitted under Section 4, the Director shall adjust 
direct spending targets for the current year, the budget year, 
and each outyear through 1997 by--
          (1) increasing the target for the current year and 
        the budget year by the amount stated for that year in 
        that reconciliation bill (but if a separate vote was 
        required by Congressional rules, only if that vote has 
        occurred); and
          (2) decreasing the target for the current, budget, 
        and outyears through 1997 by the amount of reductions 
        in direct spending enacted in that reconciliation bill.
  (e) Designated Emergencies.--The Director shall adjust the 
targets to reflect the costs of legislation that is designated 
as an emergency by Congress and the President under section 
252(e) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
of 1985 [section 902(e) of this title].
    Sec. 7. Relationship to Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act. Recommendations pursuant to Section 4 
shall include a provision specifying that reductions in outlays 
or increases in receipts resulting from that legislation shall 
not be taken into account for purposes of any budget 
enforcement procedures under the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985 [Pub.L. 99-177; see Tables].
    Sec. 8. Estimating Margin. For any fiscal year for which 
the overage is less than one-half of 1 percent of the direct 
spending target for that year, the procedures set forth in 
Section 4 shall not apply.
    Sec. 9. Means-Tested Programs. In making recommendations 
under Section 4, the Director shall seriously consider all 
other alternatives before proposing reductions in means-tested 
programs.
    Sec. 10. Effective Date. This order shall take effect upon 
enactment of OBRA [Pub.L. 103-66, which was approved Aug. 10, 
1993]. This order shall apply to direct spending targets for 
fiscal years 1994 through 1997 and shall expire at the end of 
fiscal year 1997.

        title and section 903 of this title, there shall be a 
        sequestration to eliminate a budget-year breach, if 
        any, within any category.
          (2) Eliminating a breach.--Each non-exempt account 
        within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount 
        calculated by multiplying the baseline level of 
        sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at 
        that time by the uniform percentage necessary to 
        eliminate a breach within that category; except that 
        the health programs set forth in section 906(e) of this 
        title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent and 
        the uniform percent applicable to all other programs 
        under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) 
        to a level sufficient to eliminate that breach. If, 
        within a category, the discretionary spending limits 
        for both new budget authority and outlays are breached, 
        the uniform percentage shall be calculated by--
                  (A) first, calculating the uniform percentage 
                necessary to eliminate the breach in new budget 
                authority, and
                  (B) second, if any breach in outlays remains, 
                increasing the uniform percentage to a level 
                sufficient to eliminate that breach.
          (3) Military personnel.--If the President uses the 
        authority to exempt any military personnel from 
        sequestration under section 905(h) of this title, each 
        account within subfunctional category 051 (other than 
        those military personnel accounts for which the 
        authority provided under section 905(h) of this title 
        has been exercised) shall be further reduced by a 
        dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted 
        level of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account 
        at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to 
        offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not 
        reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the 
        use of such authority.
          (4) Part-year appropriations.--If, on the date 
        specified in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act 
        making or continuing appropriations for part of a 
        fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar 
        sequestration calculated for that account under 
        paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from--
                  (A) the annualized amount otherwise available 
                by law in that account under that or a 
                subsequent part-year appropriation; and
                  (B) when a full-year appropriation for that 
                account is enacted, from the amount otherwise 
                provided by the full-year appropriation.
          (5) Look-back.--If, after June 30, an appropriation 
        for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes 
        a breach within a category for that year (after taking 
        into account any sequestration of amounts within that 
        category), the discretionary spending limits for that 
        category for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by 
        the amount or amounts of that breach.
          (6) Within-session sequestration.--If an 
        appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted 
        (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that 
        budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that 
        causes a breach within a category for that year (after 
        taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts 
        within that category), 15 days later there shall be a 
        sequestration to eliminate that breach within that 
        category following the procedures set forth in 
        paragraphs (2) through (4).
          (7) OMB estimates.--As soon as practicable after 
        Congress completes action on any discretionary 
        appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the 
        Committees on the Budget of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with 
        an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget 
        authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and 
        the budget year provided by that legislation. Within 5 
        calendar days after the enactment of any discretionary 
        appropriation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House 
        of Representatives and to the Senate containing the CBO 
        estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the 
        amount of discretionary new budget authority and 
        outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget 
        year provided by that legislation, and an explanation 
        of any difference between the two estimates. For 
        purposes of this paragraph, amounts provided by annual 
        appropriations shall include any new budget authority 
        and outlays for those years in accounts for which 
        funding is provided in that legislation that result 
        from previously enacted legislation. Those OMB 
        estimates shall be made using current economic and 
        technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates 
        transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph for 
        the purposes of this subsection. OMB and CBO shall 
        prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance 
        with scorekeeping guidelines determined after 
        consultation among the House and Senate Committees on 
        the Budget, CBO, and OMB.
  (b) Adjustments to Discretionary Spending Limits.--
          (1) When the President submits the budget under 
        section 1105(a) of Title 31 for budget year 1992, 1993, 
        1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998 (except as otherwise 
        indicated), OMB shall calculate (in the order set forth 
        below), and the budget shall include, adjustments to 
        discretionary spending limits (and those limits as 
        cumulatively adjusted) for the budget year and each 
        outyear through 1998 to reflect the following:
                  (A) Changes in concepts and definitions.--The 
                adjustments produced by the amendments made by 
                Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
                Act of 1990 or by any other changes in concepts 
                and definitions shall equal the baseline levels 
                of new budget authority and outlays using up-
                to-date concepts and definitions minus those 
                levels using the concepts and definitions in 
                effect before such changes. Such other changes 
                in concepts and definitions may only be made in 
                consultation with the Committees on 
                Appropriations, the Budget, Government 
                Operations, and Governmental Affairs of the 
                House of Representatives and Senate.
                  (B) Changes in inflation.--
                          (i) For a budget submitted for budget 
                        year 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995, the 
                        adjustments produced by changes in 
                        inflation shall equal the levels of 
                        discretionary new budget authority and 
                        outlays in the baseline (calculated 
                        using current estimates) subtracted 
                        from those levels in that baseline 
                        recalculated with the baseline 
                        inflators for the budget year only, 
                        multiplied by the inflation adjustment 
                        factor computed under clause (ii).
                          (ii) For a budget year the inflation 
                        adjustment factor shall equal the ratio 
                        between the level of year-over-year 
                        inflation measured for the fiscal year 
                        most recently completed and the 
                        applicable estimated level for that 
                        year set forth below: For 1990, 1.041; 
                        for 1991, 1.052; for 1992, 1.041; and 
                        for 1993, 1.033.
                        Inflation shall be measured by the 
                        average of the estimated gross national 
                        product implicit price deflator index 
                        for a fiscal year divided by the 
                        average index for the prior fiscal 
                        year.
                          (iii) For a budget submitted for 
                        budget year 1996, 1997, or 1998, the 
                        adjustments shall be those necessary to 
                        reflect changes in inflation estimates 
                        since those of March 31, 1993, set 
                        forth on page 46 of House Conference 
                        Report 103-48.
                  (C) Credit reestimates.--For a budget 
                submitted for fiscal year 1993 or 1994, the 
                adjustments produced by reestimates to costs of 
                Federal credit programs shall be, for any such 
                program, a current estimate of new budget 
                authority and outlays associated with a 
                baseline projection of the prior year's gross 
                loan level for that program minus the baseline 
                projection of the prior year's new budget 
                authority and associated outlays for that 
                program.
          (2) When OMB submits a sequestration report under 
        section 904(g) or (h) of this title for fiscal year 
        1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998 
        (except as otherwise indicated), OMB shall calculate 
        (in the order set forth below), and the sequestration 
        report, and subsequent budgets submitted by the 
        President under section 1105(a) of Title 31, shall 
        include, adjustments to discretionary spending limits 
        (and those limits as adjusted) for the fiscal year and 
        each succeeding year through 1998, as follows:
                  (A) IRS funding.--To the extent that 
                appropriations are enacted that provide 
                additional new budget authority or result in 
                additional outlays (as compared with the CBO 
                baseline constructed in June 1990) for the 
                Internal Revenue Service compliance initiative 
                in any fiscal year, the adjustments for that 
                year shall be those amounts, but shall not 
                exceed the amounts set forth below--
                          (i) for fiscal year 1991, 
                        $191,000,000 in new budget authority 
                        and $183,000,000 in outlays; s
                          (ii) for fiscal year 1992, 
                        $172,000,000 in new budget authority 
                        and $169,000,000 in outlays;
                          (iii) for fiscal year 1993, 
                        $183,000,000 in new budget authority 
                        and $179,000,000 in outlays;
                          (iv) for fiscal year 1994, 
                        $187,000,000 in new budget authority 
                        and $183,000,000 in outlays; and
                          (v) for fiscal year 1995, 
                        $188,000,000 in new budget authority 
                        and $184,000,000 in outlays; and
                the prior-year outlays resulting from these 
                appropriations of budget authority.
                  (B) Debt forgiveness.--If, in calendar year 
                1990 or 1991, an appropriation is enacted that 
                forgives the Arab Republic of Egypt's foreign 
                military sales indebtedness to the United 
                States and any part of the Government of 
                Poland's indebtedness to the United States, the 
                adjustment shall be the estimated costs (in new 
                budget authority and outlays, in all years) of 
                that forgiveness.
                  (C) IMF funding.--If, in fiscal year 1991, 
                1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 an appropriation is 
                enacted to provide to the International 
                Monetary Fund the dollar equivalent, in terms 
                of Special Drawing Rights, of the increase in 
                the United States quota as part of the 
                International Monetary Fund Ninth General 
                Review of Quotas, the adjustment shall be the 
                amount provided by that appropriation.
                  (D) Emergency appropriations.--
                          (i) If, for any fiscal year, 
                        appropriations for discretionary 
                        accounts are enacted that the President 
                        designates as emergency requirements 
                        and that the Congress so designates in 
                        statute, the adjustment shall be the 
                        total of such appropriations in 
                        discretionary accounts designated as 
                        emergency requirements and the outlays 
                        flowing in all years from such 
                        appropriations. This subparagraph shall 
                        not apply to appropriations to cover 
                        agricultural crop disaster assistance.
                          (ii) The costs for operation Desert 
                        Shield are to be treated as emergency 
                        funding requirements not subject to the 
                        defense spending limits. Funding for 
                        Desert Shield will be provided through 
                        the normal legislative process. Desert 
                        Shield costs should be accommodated 
                        through Allied burden-sharing, 
                        subsequent appropriation Acts, and if 
                        the President so chooses, through 
                        offsets within other defense accounts. 
                        Emergency Desert Shield costs mean 
                        those incremental costs associated with 
                        the increase in operations in the 
                        Middle East and do not include costs 
                        that would be experienced by the 
                        Department of Defense as part of its 
                        normal operations absent Operation 
                        Desert Shield.
                  (E) Special allowance for discretionary new 
                budget authority.--
                          (i) For each of fiscal years 1992 and 
                        1993, the adjustment for the domestic 
                        category in each year shall be an 
                        amount equal to 0.1 percent of the sum 
                        of the adjusted discretionary spending 
                        limits on new budget authority for all 
                        categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, 
                        and 1993 (cumulatively), together with 
                        outlays associated therewith 
                        (calculated at the composite outlay 
                        rate for the domestic category);
                          (ii) for each of fiscal years 1992 
                        and 1993, the adjustment for the 
                        international category in each year 
                        shall be an amount equal to 0.079 
                        percent of the sum of the adjusted 
                        discretionary spending limits on new 
                        budget authority for all categories for 
                        fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 
                        (cumulatively), together with outlays 
                        associated therewith (calculated at the 
                        composite outlay rate for the 
                        international category);
                          (iii) if, for fiscal years 1992 and 
                        1993, the amount of new budget 
                        authority provided in appropriation 
                        Acts exceeds the discretionary spending 
                        limit on new budget authority for any 
                        category due to technical estimates 
                        made by the Director of the Office of 
                        Management and Budget, the adjustment 
                        is the amount of the excess, but not to 
                        exceed an amount (for 1992 and 1993 
                        together) equal to 0.042 percent of the 
                        sum of the adjusted discretionary 
                        limits on new budget authority for all

                        1996, 1997, and 1998, the amount of new 
                        budget authority provided in 
                        appropriation Acts exceeds the 
                        discretionary spending limit on new 
                        budget authority due to technical 
                        estimates made by the director of the 
                        Office of Management and Budget, the 
                        adjustment is the amount of the excess, 
                        but not to exceed an amount (for any 
                        one fiscal year) equal to 0.1 percent 
                        of the adjusted descretionary spending 
                        limit on new budget authority for that 
                        fiscal year.
                  (F) Special outlay allowance.--If in any 
                fiscal year outlays for a category exceed the 
                discretionary spending limit for that category 
                but new budget authority does not exceed its 
                limit for that category (after application of 
                the first step of a sequestration described in 
                subsection (a)(2) of this section, if 
                necessary), the adjustment in outlays is the 
                amount of the excess, but not to exceed 
                $2,500,000,000 in the defense category, 
                $1,500,000,000 in the international category, 
                or $2,500,000,000 in the domestic category (as 
                applicable) in fiscal year 1991, 1992, or 1993, 
                and not to exceed $6,500,000,000 in fiscal year 
                1994 or 1995 less any of the outlay adjustments 
                made under subparagraph (E) for a category for 
                a fiscal year, and not to exceed 0.5 percent of 
                the adjusted descretionary spending limit on 
                outlays for the fiscal year in fiscal year 
                1996, 1997, or 1998.

                fiscal year 1994 and 1995 of the appropriation 
                made under section 2186 of Title 22 are not 
                subject to the discretionary spending limits or 
                the Appropriations Committee's Foreign 
                Operations Subcommittee's 602(b) allocation in 
                fiscal year 1994 and 1995.

SEC. 902. ENFORCING PAY-AS-YOU-GO.

  (a) Fiscal year 1992-1998 Enforcement.--The purpose of this 
section is to assure that any legislation (enacted after 
November 5, 1990) affecting direct spending or receipts that 
increases the deficit in any fiscal year covered by this Act 
will trigger an offsetting sequestration.
  (b) Sequestration; Look-back.--Within 15 calendar days after 
Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One 
Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration 
(if any) under section 901 of this title and section 903 of 
this title, there shall be a sequestration to offset the amount 
of any net deficit increase in that fiscal year and the prior 
fiscal year caused by all direct spending and receipts 
legislation enacted after the date of enactment of this section 
(after adjusting for any prior sequestration as provided by 
paragraph (2)). OMB shall calculate the amount of deficit 
increase, if any, in those fiscal years by adding--
          (1) all applicable estimates of direct spending and 
        receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d) 
        of this section applicable to those fiscal years, other 
        than any amounts included in such estimates resulting 
        from--
                  (A) full funding of, and continuation of, the 
                deposit insurance guarantee commitment in 
                effect on November 5, 1990, and
                  (B) emergency provisions as designated under 
                subsection (e) of this section; and
          (2) the estimated amount of savings in direct 
        spending programs applicable to those fiscal years 
        resulting from the prior year's sequestration under 
        this section or section 903 of this title, if any 
        (except for any amounts sequestered as a result of a 
        net deficit increase in the fiscal year immediately 
        preceding the prior fiscal year), as published in OMB's 
        end-of-session sequestration report for that prior 
        year.
  (c) Eliminating a Deficit Increase.--
          (1) The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal 
        year under subsection (b) of this section shall be 
        obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts from 
        actions taken in the following order:
                  (A) First.--All reductions in automatic 
                spending increases specified in section 906(a) 
                of this title shall be made.
                  (B) Second.--If additional reductions in 
                direct spending accounts are required to be 
                made, the maximum reductions permissible under 
                sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed 
                student loans) and 906(c) of this title (foster 
                care and adoption assistance) shall be made.
                  (C) Third.--
                          (i) If additional reductions in 
                        direct spending accounts are required 
                        to be made, each remaining non-exempt 
                        direct spending account shall be 
                        reduced by the uniform percentage 
                        necessary to make the reductions in 
                        direct spending required by paragraph 
                        (1); except that the medicare programs 
                        specified in section 906(d) of this 
                        title shall not be reduced by more than 
                        4 percent and the uniform percentage 
                        applicable to all other direct spending 
                        programs under this paragraph shall be 
                        increased (if necessary) to a level 
                        sufficient to achieve the required 
                        reduction in direct spending.
                          (ii) For purposes of determining 
                        reductions under clause (i), outlay 
                        reductions (as a result of 
                        sequestration of Commodity Credit 
                        Corporation commodity price support 
                        contracts in the fiscal year of a 
                        sequestration) that would occur in the 
                        following fiscal year shall be credited 
                        as outlay reductions in the fiscal year 
                        of the sequestration.
                  (2) For purposes of this subsection, accounts 
                shall be assumed to be at the level in the 
                baseline.
  (d) OMB Estimates.--As soon as practicable after Congress 
completes action on any direct spending or receipts legislation 
enacted after November 5, 1990, after consultation with the 
Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate, CBO shall provide OMB with an estimate of the 
amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in 
each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that 
legislation. Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any 
direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 
5, 1990, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of 
Representatives and to the Senate containing such CBO estimate 
of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of change in 
outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year 
through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation, and 
an explanation of any difference between the two estimates. 
Those OMB estimates shall be made using current economic and 
technical assumptions. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates 
under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping 
guidelines determined after consultation among the House and 
Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.
  (e) Emergency Legislation.--If, for any fiscal year from 1991 
through 1998, a provision of direct spending or receipts 
legislation is enacted that the President designates as an 
emergency requirement and that the Congress so designates in 
statute, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and 
receipts in all fiscal years through 1995 resulting from that 
provision shall be designated as an emergency requirement in 
the reports required under subsection (d) of this section. This 
subsection shall not apply to direct spending provisions to 
cover agricultural crop disaster assistance.

        part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 
        [20 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1071 et seq.], as a consequence of an 
        order issued pursuant to section 904 of this title, 
        shall be achieved only from loans described in 
        paragraphs (2) and (3) by the application of the 
        measures described in such paragraphs.
          (2) For any loan made during the period beginning on 
        the date that an order issued under section 904 of this 
        title takes effect with respect to a fiscal year and 
        ending at the close of such fiscal year, the rate used

        the reduction made in payments under that order shall 
        achieve the required total percentage reduction in

                applied to payment for services furnished 
                during the effective period of the order. For 
                purposes of the previous sentence, in the case

                relating to the reasonable cost incurred for 
                the services during a cost reporting period of 
                the provider, if a reduction is made under 
                paragraph (1), in payment amounts pursuant to a 
                sequestration order, the reduction shall be 
                applied to payment for costs for such services 
                incurred at any time during each cost reporting 
                period of the provider any part of which occurs 
                during the effective period of the order, but 
                only (for each such cost reporting period) in 
                the same proportion as the fraction of the cost 
                reporting period that occurs during the 
                effective period of the order.
          (3) No increase in beneficiary charges in assignment-
        related cases.--If a reduction in payment amounts is 
        made under paragraph (1) for services for which payment

        of an assignment described in section 1842(b)(3)(B)(ii)

        with section 1842(b)(6)(B) [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 
        1395u(b)(6)(B)], or under the procedure described in 
        section 1870(f)(1) [42 U.S.C.A Sec. 1395gg(f)(1)], of 
        such Act, the person furnishing the services shall be 
        considered to have accepted payment of the reasonable 
        charge for the services, less any reduction in payment 
        amount made pursuant to a sequestration order, as 
        payment in full.
          (4) No effect on computation of adjusted average per 
        capita cost.--In computing the adjusted average per 
        capita cost for purposes of section 1876(a)(4) of the

        U.S.C.A. Sec. 3304(A)(11)].
  (j) Commodity Credit Corporation.--
          (1) Powers and authorities of commodity credit 
        corporation.--This title shall not restrict the

        proceeds as a revolving fund to meet other obligations 
        and otherwise operate as a corporation, the purpose for

          (2) Reduction in payments made under contracts.--
                  (A) Payments and loan eligibility under any 
                contract entered into with a person by the 
                Commodity Credit Corporation prior to the time 
                an order has been issued under section 904 of 
                this title shall not be reduced by an order 
                subsequently issued. Subject to subparagraph 
                (B), after an order is issued under such 
                section for a fiscal year, any cash payments 
                made by the Commodity Credit Corporation--
                          (i) under the terms of any one-year 
                        contract entered into in such fiscal 
                        year and after the issuance of the 
                        order; and
                          (ii) out of an entitlement account,
                to any person (including any producer, lender, 
                or guarantee entity) shall be subject to 
                reduction under the order.
                  (B) Each contract entered into with producers 
                or producer cooperatives with respect to a 
                particular crop of a commodity and subject to 
                reduction under subparagraph (A) shall be 
                reduced in accordance with the same terms and 
                conditions. If some, but not all, contracts 
                applicable to a crop of a commodity have been 
                entered into prior to the issuance of an order 
                under section 904 of this title, the order 
                shall provide that the necessary reduction in 
                payments under contracts applicable to the 
                commodity be uniformly applied to all contracts 
                for the next succeeding crop of the commodity, 
                under the authority provided in paragraph (3).
          (3) Delayed reduction in outlays permissible.--
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this joint 
        resolution, if an order under section 904 of this title 
        is issued with respect to a fiscal year, any reduction 
        under the order applicable to contracts described in 
        paragraph (1) may provide for reductions in outlays for 
        the account involved to occur in the fiscal year 
        following the fiscal year to which the order applies. 
        No other account, or other program, project, or 
        activity, shall bear an increased reduction for the 
        fiscal year to which the order applies as a result of 
        the operation of the preceding sentence.
          (4) Uniform percentage rate of reduction and other 
        limitations.--All reductions described in paragraph (2) 
        which are required to be made in connection with an 
        order issued under section 904 of this title with 
        respect to a fiscal year--
                  (A) shall be made so as to ensure that 
                outlays for each program, project, activity, or 
                account involved are reduced by a percentage 
                rate that is uniform for all such programs, 
                projects, activities, and accounts, and may not 
                be made so as to achieve a percentage rate of 
                reduction in any such item exceeding the rate 
                specified in the order; and
                  (B) with respect to commodity price support 
                and income protection programs, shall be made 
                in such manner and under such procedures as 
                will attempt to ensure that--
                          (i) uncertainty as to the scope of 
                        benefits under any such program is 
                        minimized;
                          (ii) any instability in market prices 
                        for agricultural commodities resulting 
                        from the reduction is minimized; and
                          (iii) normal production and marketing 
                        relationships among agricultural 
                        commodities (including both contract 
                        and non-contract commodities) are not 
                        distorted.
                In meeting the criterion set out in clause 
                (iii) of subparagraph (B) of the preceding 
                sentence, the President shall take into 
                consideration that reductions under an order 
                may apply to programs for two or more 
                agricultural commodities that use the same type 
                of production or marketing resources or that 
                are alternative commodities among which a 
                producer could choose in making annual 
                production decisions.
          (5) No double reduction.--No agricultural price 
        support or income protection program that is subject to 
        reduction under an order issued under section 904 of 
        this title for a fiscal year may be subject, as well, 
        to modification or suspension under such order as an 
        automatic spending increase.
          (6) Certain authority not to be limited.--Nothing in 
        this joint resolution shall limit or reduce, in any 
        way, any appropriation that provides the Commodity 
        Credit Corporation with budget authority to cover the 
        Corporation's net realized losses.
  (k) Special Rules for the JOBS portion of AFDC.--
          (1) Full amount of sequestration required.--Any order 
        issued by the President under section 904 of this title 
        shall accomplish the full amount of any required 
        sequestration of the job opportunities and basic skills 
        training program under section 402(a)(19) [42 U.S.C.A. 
        Sec. 602(a)(19)], and part F of title VI, of the Social 
        Security Act, in the manner specified in this 
        subsection. Such an order may not reduce any Federal 
        matching rate pursuant to section 403(l) of the Social 
        Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 603(l)].
          (2) New allotment formula.--
                  (A) General rule.--Notwithstanding section 
                403(k) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. 
                Sec. 603(k)], each State's percentage share of 
                the amount available after sequestration for 
                direct spending pursuant to section 403(l) of 
                such Act [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 603(l)] for the 
                fiscal year to which the sequestration applies 
                shall be equal to--
                          (I) that percentage of the total 
                        amount paid to the States pursuant to 
                        such section 403(l) for the prior 
                        fiscal year that is represented by the 
                        amount paid to such State pursuant to 
                        such section 403(l) [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 
                        603(l)] for the prior fiscal year; or
                          (II) the amount that would have been 
                        allotted to such State pursuant to such 
                        section 403(k) [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 
                        603(k)] had the sequestration not been 
                        in effect.
                  (B) Reallotment of amounts remaining 
                unallotted after application of general rule.--
                Any amount made available after sequestration 
                for direct spending pursuant to section 403(l) 
                of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 
                603(l)] for the fiscal year to which the 
                sequestration applies that remains unallotted 
                as a result of subparagraph (A) of this 
                paragraph shall be allotted among the States in 
                proportion to the absolute difference between 
                the amount allotted, respectively, to each 
                State as a result of such subparagraph and the 
                amount that would have been allotted to such 
                State pursuant to section 403(k) [42 U.S.C.A. 
                Sec. 603(k)] of such Act had the sequestration 
                not been in effect, except that a State may not 
                be allotted an amount under this subparagraph 
                that results in a total allotment to the State 
                under this paragraph of more than the amount 
                that would have been allotted to such State 
                pursuant to such section 403(k) [42 U.S.C.A. 
                Sec. 603(k)] had the sequestration not been in 
                effect.
  (l) Effects of Sequestration.--The effects of sequestration 
shall be as follows:
          (1) Budgetary resources sequestered from any account 
        other than a trust or special fund account shall be 
        permanently cancelled.
          (2) Except as otherwise provided, the same percentage 
        sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, 
        and activities within a budget account (with programs, 
        projects, and activities as delineated in the 
        appropriation Act or accompanying report for the 
        relevant fiscal year covering that account, or for 
        accounts not included in appropriation Acts, as 
        delineated in the most recently submitted President's 
        budget).
          (3) Administrative regulations or similar actions 
        implementing a sequestration shall be made within 120 
        days of the sequestration order. To the extent that 
        formula allocations differ at different levels of 
        budgetary resources within an account, program, 
        project, or activity, the sequestration shall be 
        interpreted as producing a lower total appropriation, 
        with the remaining amount of the appropriation being 
        obligated in a manner consistent with program 
        allocation formulas in substantive law.
          (4) Except as otherwise provided, obligations in 
        sequestered accounts shall be reduced only in the 
        fiscal year in which a sequester occurs.
          (5) If an automatic spending increase is sequestered, 
        the increase (in the applicable index) that was 
        disregarded as a result of that sequestration shall not 
        be taken into account in any subsequent fiscal year.
          (6) Except as otherwise provided, sequestration in 
        trust and special fund accounts for which obligations 
        are indefinite shall be taken in a manner to ensure 
        that obligations in the fiscal year of a sequestration 
        are reduced, from the level that would actually have 
        occurred, by the applicable sequestration percentage.

SEC. 907. THE BASELINE.

  (a) In General.--For any budget year, the baseline refers to 
a projection of current-year levels of new budget authority, 
outlays, revenues, and the surplus or deficit into the budget 
year and the outyears based on laws enacted through the 
applicable date.
  (b) Direct Spending and Receipts.--For the budget year and 
each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the 
following assumptions:
          (1) In general.--Laws providing or creating direct 
        spending and receipts are assumed to operate in the 
        manner specified in those laws for each such year and 
        funding for entitlement authority is assumed to be 
        adequate to make all payments required by those laws.
          (2) Exceptions.--
                  (A) No program with estimated current-year 
                outlays greater than $50 million shall be 
                assumed to expire in the budget year or 
                outyears.
                  (B) The increase for veterans' compensation 
                for a fiscal year is assumed to be the same as 
                that required by law for veterans' pensions 
                unless otherwise provided by law enacted in 
                that session.
                  (C) Excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund, 
                if expiring, are assumed to be extended at 
                current rates.
          (3) Hospital insurance trust fund.--Notwithstanding 
        any other provision of law, the receipts and 
        disbursements of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund 
        shall be included in all calculations required by this 
        Act.
  (c) Discretionary Appropriations.--For the budget year and 
each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the 
following assumptions regarding all amounts other than those 
covered by subsection (b) of this section:
          (1) Inflation of current-year appropriations.--
        Budgetary resources other than unobligated balances 
        shall be at the level provided for the budget year in 
        full-year appropriation Acts. If for any account a 
        full-year appropriation has not yet been enacted, 
        budgetary resources other than unobligated balances 
        shall be at the level available in the current year, 
        adjusted sequentially and cumulatively for expiring 
        housing contracts as specified in paragraph (2), for 
        social insurance administrative expenses as specified 
        in paragraph (3), to offset pay absorption and for pay 
        annualization as specified in paragraph (4), for 
        inflation as specified in paragraph (5), and to account 
        for changes required by law in the level of agency 
        payments for personnel benefits other than pay.
          (2) Expiring housing contracts.--New budget authority 
        to renew expiring multiyear subsidized housing 
        contracts shall be adjusted to reflect the difference 
        in the number of such contracts that are scheduled to 
        expire in that fiscal year and the number expiring in 
        the current year, with the per-contract renewal cost 
        equal to the average current-year cost of renewal 
        contracts.
          (3) Social insurance administrative expenses.--
        Budgetary resources for the administrative expenses of 
        the following trust funds shall be adjusted by the 
        percentage change in the beneficiary population from 
        the current year to that fiscal year: the Federal 
        Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary 
        Medical Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust 
        Fund, and the railroad retirement account.
          (4) Pay annualization; offset to pay absorption.--
        Current-year new budget authority for Federal employees 
        shall be adjusted to reflect the full 12-month costs 
        (without absorption) of any pay adjustment that 
        occurred in that fiscal year.
          (5) Inflators.--The inflator used in paragraph (1) to 
        adjust budgetary resources relating to personnel shall 
        be the percent by which the average of the Bureau of 
        Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (wages and 
        salaries, private industry workers) for that fiscal 
        year differs from such index for the current year. The 
        inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust all other 
        budgetary resources shall be the percent by which the 
        average of the estimated gross national product fixed-
        weight price index for that fiscal year differs from 
        the average of such estimated index for the current 
        year.
          (6) Current-year appropriations.--If, for any 
        account, a continuing appropriation is in effect for 
        less than the entire current year, then the current-
        year amount shall be assumed to equal the amount that 
        would be available if that continuing appropriation 
        covered the entire fiscal year. If law permits the 
        transfer of budget authority among budget accounts in 
        the current year, the current-year level for an account 
        shall reflect transfers accomplished by the submission 
        of, or assumed for the current year in, the President's 
        original budget for the budget year.
  (d) Up-to-Date Concepts.--In deriving the baseline for any 
budget year or outyear, current-year amounts shall be 
calculated using the concepts and definitions that are required 
for that budget year.
  (e) Sale of Assets or Prepayment of Loans.--The sale of an 
asset or prepayment of a loan shall not alter the deficit or 
produce any net deficit reduction in the budget baseline, 
except that the budget baseline estimate shall include asset 
sales mandated by law before September 18, 1987, and routine, 
ongoing asset sales and loan prepayments at levels consistent 
with agency operations in fiscal year 1986.

SEC. 907A. SUSPENSION IN THE EVENT OF WAR OR LOW GROWTH.

  (a) Procedures in the Event of a Low Growth Report.--
          (1) Trigger.--Whenever CBO issues a low-growth report 
        under section 254(j), the Majority Leader of the House 
        of Representatives may, and the Majority Leader of the 
        Senate shall, introduce a joint resolution (in the form 
        set forth in paragraph (2)) declaring that the 
        conditions specified in section 254(j) are met and 
        suspending the relevant provisions of this title, 
        titles III and VI of the Congressional Budget Act of 
        1974, and section 1103 of title 31, United States Code.
          (2) Form of joint resolution.--
                  (A) The matter after the resolving clause in 
                any joint resolution introduced pursuant to 
                paragraph (1) shall be as follows: That the 
                Congress declares that the conditions specified 
                in section 254(j) of the Balanced Budget and 
                Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 are met, 
                and the implementation of the Congressional 
                Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 
                chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code, and 
                part C of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
                Deficit Control Act of 1985 are modified as 
                described in section 258(b) of the Balanced 
                Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
                1985.
                  (B) The title of the joint resolution shall 
                be ``Joint resolution suspending certain 
                provisions of law pursuant to section 258(a)(2) 
                of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
                Control Act of 1985.''; and the joint 
                resolution shall not contain any preamble.
          (3) Committee action.--Each joint resolution 
        introduced pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be referred 
        to the appropriate committees of the House of 
        Representatives or the Committee on the Budget of the 
        Senate, as the case may be; and such Committee shall 
        report the joint resolution to its House without 
        amendment on or before the fifth day on which such 
        House is in session after the date on which the joint 
        resolution is introduced. If the Committee fails to 
        report the joint resolution within the five-day period 
        referred to in the preceding sentence, it shall be 
        automatically discharged from further consideration of 
        the joint resolution, and the joint resolution shall be 
        placed on the appropriate calendar.
          (4) Consideration of joint resolution.--
                  (A) A vote on final passage of a joint 
                resolution reported to the Senate or discharged 
                pursuant to paragraph (3) shall be taken on or 
                before the close of the fifth calendar day of 
                session after the date on which the joint 
                resolution is reported or after the Committee 
                has been discharged from further consideration 
                of the joint resolution. If prior to the 
                passage by one House of a joint resolution of 
                that House, that House receives the same joint 
                resolution from the other House, then--
                          (i) the procedure in that House shall 
                        be the same as if no such joint 
                        resolution had been received from the 
                        other House, but
                          (ii) the vote on final passage shall 
                        be on the joint resolution of the other 
                        House.
                When the joint resolution is agreed to, the 
                Clerk of the House of Representatives (in the 
                case of a House joint resolution agreed to in 
                the House of Representatives) or the Secretary 
                of the Senate (in the case of a Senate joint 
                resolution agreed to in the Senate) shall cause 
                the joint resolution to be engrossed, 
                certified, and transmitted to the other House 
                of the Congress as soon as practicable.
                  (B) (i) In the Senate, a joint resolution 
                under this paragraph shall be privileged. It 
                shall not be in order to move to reconsider the 
                vote by which the motion is agreed to or 
                disagreed to.
                  (ii) Debate in the Senate on a joint 
                resolution under this paragraph, and all 
                debatable motions and appeals in connection 
                therewith, shall be limited to not more than 
                five hours. The time shall be equally divided 
                between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
                and the minority leader or their designees.
                  (iii) Debate in the Senate on any debatable 
                motion or appeal in connection with a joint 
                resolution under this paragraph shall be 
                limited to not more than one hour, to be 
                equally divided between, and controlled by, the 
                mover and the manager of the joint resolution, 
                except that in the event the manager of the 
                joint resolution is in favor of any such motion 
                or appeal, the time in opposition thereto shall 
                be controlled by the minority leader or his 
                designee.
                  (iv) A motion in the Senate to further limit 
                debate on a joint resolution under this 
                paragraph is not debatable. A motion to table 
                or to recommit a joint resolution under this 
                paragraph is not in order.
                  (C) No amendment to a joint resolution 
                considered under this paragraph shall be in 
                order in the Senate.
  (b) Suspension of Sequestration Procedures.--Upon the 
enactment of a declaration of war or a joint resolution 
described in subsection (a)--
          (1) the subsequent issuance of any sequestration 
        report or any sequestration order is precluded;
          (2) sections 302(f), 310(d), 311(a), and title VI of 
        the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 are suspended; and
          (3) section 1103 of title 31, United States Code, is 
        suspended.
  (c) Restoration of Sequestration Procedures.--
          (1) In the event of a suspension of sequestration 
        procedures due to a declaration of war, then, effective 
        with the first fiscal year that begins in the session 
        after the state of war is concluded by Senate 
        ratification of the necessary treaties, the provisions 
        of subsection (b) triggered by that declaration of war 
        are no longer effective.
          (2) In the event of a suspension of sequestration 
        procedures due to the enactment of a joint resolution 
        described in subsection (a), then, effective with 
        regard to the first fiscal year beginning at least 12 
        months after the enactment of that resolution, the 
        provisions of subsection (b) triggered by that 
        resolution are no longer effective.

SEC. 907B. MODIFICATION OF PRESIDENTIAL ORDER.

  (a) Introduction of Joint Resolution.--At any time after the 
Director of OMB issues a final sequestration report under 
section 904 of this title for a fiscal year, but before the 
close of the twentieth calendar day of the session of Congress 
beginning after the date of issuance of such report, the 
majority leader of either House of Congress may introduce a 
joint resolution which contains provisions directing the 
President to modify the most recent order issued under section 
904 of this title or provide an alternative to reduce the 
deficit for such fiscal year. After the introduction of the 
first such joint resolution in either House of Congress in any 
calendar year, then no other joint resolution introduced in 
such House in such calendar year shall be subject to the 
procedures set forth in this section.
  (b) Procedures for Consideration of Joint Resolutions.--
          (1) Referral to committee.--A joint resolution 
        introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) of this 
        section shall not be referred to a committee of the 
        Senate and shall be placed on the calendar pending 
        disposition of such joint resolution in accordance with 
        this subsection.
          (2) Consideration in the senate.--On or after the 
        third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and 
        legal holidays) beginning after a joint resolution is 
        introduced under subsection (a) of this section, 
        notwithstanding any rule or precedent of the Senate, 
        including Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the 
        Senate, it is in order (even though a previous motion 
        to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any 
        Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the 
        consideration of the joint resolution. The motion is 
        not in order after the eighth calendar day (excluding 
        Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after 
        a joint resolution (to which the motion applies) is 
        introduced. The joint resolution is privileged in the 
        Senate. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the 
        motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in 
        order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
        the joint resolution is agreed to, the Senate shall 
        immediately proceed to consideration of the joint 
        resolution without intervening motion, order, or other 
        business, and the joint resolution shall remain the 
        unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of.
          (3) Debate in the senate.--
                  (A) In the Senate, debate on a joint 
                resolution introduced under subsection (a) of 
                this section, amendments thereto, and all 
                debatable motions and appeals in connection 
                therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 
                hours, which shall be divided equally between 
                the majority leader and the minority leader (or 
                their designees).
                  (B) A motion to postpone, or a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of other business 
                is not in order. A motion to reconsider the 
                vote by which the joint resolution is agreed to 
                or disagreed to is not in order, and a motion 
                to recommit the joint resolution is not in 
                order.
                  (C) (i) No amendment that is not germane to 
                the provisions of the joint resolution or to 
                the order issued under section 904 of this 
                title shall be in order in the Senate. In the 
                Senate, an amendment, any amendment to an 
                amendment, or any debatable motion or appeal is 
                debatable for not to exceed 30 minutes to be 
                equally divided between, and controlled by, the 
                mover and the majority leader (or their 
                designees), except that in the event that the 
                majority leader favors the amendment, motion, 
                or appeal, the minority leader (or the minority 
                leader's designee) shall control the time in 
                opposition to the amendment, motion, or appeal.
                  (ii) In the Senate, an amendment that is 
                otherwise in order shall be in order 
                notwithstanding the fact that it amends the 
                joint resolution in more than one place or 
                amends language previously amended. It shall 
                not be in order in the Senate to vote on the 
                question of agreeing to such a joint resolution 
                or any amendment thereto unless the figures 
                then contained in such joint resolution or 
                amendment are mathematically consistent.
          (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the 
        conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution 
        introduced under subsection (a) of this section, a 
        single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if 
        requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate, 
        and the disposition of any pending amendments under 
        paragraph (3), the vote on final passage of the joint 
        resolution shall occur.
          (5) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair 
        shall be decided without debate.
          (6) Conference reports.--In the Senate, points of 
        order under titles III, IV, and VI of the Congressional 
        Budget Act of 1974 [2 U.S.C.A. Secs. 631 et seq., 651 
        et seq., and 665 et seq.] are applicable to a 
        conference report on the joint resolution or any 
        amendments in disagreement thereto.
          (7) Resolution from other house.--If, before the 
        passage by the Senate of a joint resolution of the 
        Senate introduced under subsection (a) of this section, 
        the Senate receives from the House of Representatives a 
        joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of 
        this section, then the following procedures shall 
        apply:
                  (A) The joint resolution of the House of 
                Representatives shall not be referred to a 
                committee and shall be placed on the calendar.
                  (B) With respect to a joint resolution 
                introduced under subsection (a) of this section 
                in the Senate--
                          (i) the procedure in the Senate shall 
                        be the same as if no joint resolution 
                        had been received from the House; but
                          (ii)(I) the vote on final passage 
                        shall be on the joint resolution of the 
                        House if it is identical to the joint 
                        resolution then pending for passage in 
                        the Senate; or
                          (II) if the joint resolution from the 
                        House is not identical to the joint 
                        resolution then pending for passage in 
                        the Senate and the Senate then passes 
                        the Senate joint resolution, the Senate 
                        shall be considered to have passed the 
                        House joint resolution as amended by 
                        the text of the Senate joint 
                        resolution.
                  (C) Upon disposition of the joint resolution 
                received from the House, it shall no longer be 
                in order to consider the resolution originated 
                in the Senate.
          (8) Senate action on house resolution.--If the Senate 
        receives from the House of Representatives a joint 
        resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this 
        section after the Senate has disposed of a Senate 
        originated resolution which is identical to the House 
        passed joint resolution, the action of the Senate with 
        regard to the disposition of the Senate originated 
        joint resolution shall be deemed to be the action of 
        the Senate with regard to the House originated joint 
        resolution. If it is not identical to the House passed 
        joint resolution, then the Senate shall be considered 
        to have passed the joint resolution of the House as 
        amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.

SEC. 907C. FLEXIBILITY AMONG DEFENSE PROGRAMS, PROJECTS, AND 
                    ACTIVITIES.

  (a) Reductions Beyond Amount Specified in Presidential 
Order.--Subject to subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this 
section, new budget authority and unobligated balances for any 
programs, projects, or activities within major functional 
category 050 (other than a military personnel account) may be 
further reduced beyond the amount specified in an order issued 
by the President under section 904 of this title for such 
fiscal year. To the extent such additional reductions are made 
and result in additional outlay reductions, the President may 
provide for lesser reductions in new budget authority and 
unobligated balances for other programs, projects, or 
activities within major functional category 050 for such fiscal 
year, but only to the extent that the resulting outlay 
increases do not exceed the additional outlay reductions, and 
no such program, project, or activity may be increased above 
the level actually made available by law in appropriation Acts 
(before taking sequestration into account). In making 
calculations under this subsection, the President shall use 
account outlay rates that are identical to those used in the 
report by the Director of OMB under section 904 of this title.
  (b) Base Closures Prohibited.--No actions taken by the 
President under subsection (a) of this section for a fiscal 
year may result in a domestic base closure or realignment that 
would otherwise be subject to section 2687 of Title 10.
  (c) Report and Joint Resolution Required.--The President may 
not exercise the authority provided by this paragraph for a 
fiscal year unless--
          (1) the President submits a single report to Congress 
        specifying, for each account, the detailed changes 
        proposed to be made for such fiscal year pursuant to 
        this section;
          (2) that report is submitted within 5 calendar days 
        of the start of the next session of Congress; and
          (3) a joint resolution affirming or modifying the 
        changes proposed by the President pursuant to this 
        paragraph becomes law.
  (d) Introduction of Joint Resolution.--Within 5 calendar days 
of session after the President submits a report to Congress 
under subsection (c)(1) of this section for a fiscal year, the 
majority leader of each House of Congress shall (by request) 
introduce a joint resolution which contains provisions 
affirming the changes proposed by the President pursuant to 
this paragraph.
  (e) Form and Title of Joint Resolution.--
          (1) The matter after the resolving clause in any 
        joint resolution introduced pursuant to subsection (d) 
        of this section shall be as follows: ``That the report 
        of the President as submitted on [Insert Date] under 
        section 258B is hereby approved.''
          (2) The title of the joint resolution shall be 
        ``Joint resolution approving the report of the 
        President submitted under section 258B of the Balanced 
        Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.''
          (3) Such joint resolution shall not contain any 
        preamble.
  (f) Calendaring and Consideration of Joint Resolution in the 
Senate.--
          (1) A joint resolution introduced in the Senate under 
        subsection (d) of this section shall be referred to the 
        Committee on Appropriations, and if not reported within 
        5 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and 
        legal holidays) from the date of introduction shall be 
        considered as having been discharged therefrom and 
        shall be placed on the appropriate calendar pending 
        disposition of such joint resolution in accordance with 
        this subsection. In the Senate, no amendment proposed 
        in the Committee on Appropriations shall be in order 
        other than an amendment (in the nature of a substitute) 
        that is germane or relevant to the provisions of the 
        joint resolution or to the order issued under section 
        904 of this title. For purposes of this paragraph, an 
        amendment shall be considered to be relevant if it 
        relates to function 050 (national defense).
          (2) On or after the third calendar day (excluding 
        Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after 
        a joint resolution is placed on the Senate calendar, 
        notwithstanding any rule or precedent of the Senate, 
        including Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the 
        Senate, it is in order (even though a previous motion 
        to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any 
        Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the 
        consideration of the joint resolution. The motion is 
        not in order after the eighth calendar day (excluding 
        Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after 
        such joint resolution is placed on the appropriate 
        calendar. The motion is not debatable. The joint 
        resolution is privileged in the Senate. A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or 
        disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to 
        proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution is 
        agreed to, the Senate shall immediately proceed to 
        consideration of the joint resolution without 
        intervening motion, order, or other business, and the 
        joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business 
        of the Senate until disposed of.
  (g) Debate of Joint Resolution; Motions.--
          (1) In the Senate, debate on a joint resolution 
        introduced under subsection (d) of this section, 
        amendments thereto, and all debatable motions and 
        appeals in connection therewith shall be limited to not 
        more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally 
        between the majority leader and the minority leader (or 
        their designees).
          (2) A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to 
        the consideration of other business is not in order. A 
        motion to reconsider the vote by which the joint 
        resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in 
        order. In the Senate, a motion to recommit the joint 
        resolution is not in order.
  (h) Amendment of Joint Resolution.--
          (1) No amendment that is not germane or relevant to 
        the provisions of the joint resolution or to the order 
        issued under section 904 of this title shall be in 
        order in the Senate. For purposes of this paragraph, an 
        amendment shall be considered to be relevant if it 
        relates to function 050 (national defense). In the 
        Senate, an amendment, any amendment to an amendment, or 
        any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for not to 
        exceed 30 minutes to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the mover and the majority leader (or 
        their designees), except that in the event that the 
        majority leader favors the amendment, motion, or 
        appeal, the minority leader (or the minority leader's 
        designee) shall control the time in opposition to the 
        amendment, motion, or appeal.
          (2) In the Senate, an amendment that is otherwise in 
        order shall be in order notwithstanding the fact that 
        it amends the joint resolution in more than one place 
        or amends language previously amended, so long as the 
        amendment makes or maintains mathematical consistency. 
        It shall not be in order in the Senate to vote on the 
        question of agreeing to such a joint resolution or any 
        amendment thereto unless the figures then contained in 
        such joint resolution or amendment are mathematically 
        consistent.
          (3) It shall not be in order in the Senate to 
        consider any amendment to any joint resolution 
        introduced under subsection (d) of this section or any 
        conference report thereon if such amendment or 
        conference report would have the effect of decreasing 
        any specific budget outlay reductions below the level 
        of such outlay reductions provided in such joint 
        resolution unless such amendment or conference report 
        makes a reduction in other specific budget outlays at 
        least equivalent to any increase in outlays provided by 
        such amendment or conference report.
          (4) For purposes of the application of paragraph (3), 
        the level of outlays and specific budget outlay 
        reductions provided in an amendment shall be determined 
        on the basis of estimates made by the Committee on the 
        Budget of the Senate.
  (i) Vote on Final Passage of Joint Resolution.--Immediately 
following the conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution 
introduced under subsection (d) of this section, a single 
quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in 
accordance with the rules of the Senate, and the disposition of 
any pending amendments under subsection (h) of this section, 
the vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.
  (j) Appeal From Decision of Chair.--Appeals from the 
decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules 
of the Senate to the procedure relating to a joint resolution 
described in subsection (d) of this section shall be decided 
without debate.
  (k) Conference Reports.--In the Senate, points of order under 
titles III [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 631 et seq.] and IV [2 U.S.C.A. 
Sec. 651 et seq.] of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
(including points of order under sections 302(c) [2 U.S.C.A. 
Sec. 633(c)], 303(a) [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 634(a)], 306 [2 U.S.C.A. 
Sec. 637], and 401(b)(1) [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 651(b)(1)]) are 
applicable to a conference report on the joint resolution or 
any amendments in disagreement thereto.
  (l) Resolution From Other House.--If, before the passage by 
the Senate of a joint resolution of the Senate introduced under 
subsection (d) of this section, the Senate receives from the 
House of Representatives a joint resolution introduced under 
subsection (d) of this section, then the following procedures 
shall apply:
          (1) The joint resolution of the House of 
        Representatives shall not be referred to a committee.
          (2) With respect to a joint resolution introduced 
        under subsection (d) of this section in the Senate--
                  (A) the procedure in the Senate shall be the 
                same as if no joint resolution had been 
                received from the House; but
                  (B)(i) the vote on final passage shall be on 
                the joint resolution of the House if it is 
                identical to the joint resolution then pending 
                for passage in the Senate; or
                  (ii) if the joint resolution from the House 
                is not identical to the joint resolution then 
                pending for passage in the Senate and the 
                Senate then passes the Senate joint resolution, 
                the Senate shall be considered to have passed 
                the House joint resolution as amended by the 
                text of the Senate joint resolution.
          (3) Upon disposition of the joint resolution received 
        from the House, it shall no longer be in order to 
        consider the joint resolution originated in the Senate.
  (m) Senate Action on House Resolution.--If the Senate 
receives from the House of Representatives a joint resolution 
introduced under subsection (d) of this section after the 
Senate has disposed of a Senate originated joint resolution 
which is identical to the House passed joint resolution, the 
action of the Senate with regard to the disposition of the 
Senate originated joint resolution shall be deemed to be the 
action of the Senate with regard to the House originated joint 
resolution. If it is not identical to the House passed joint 
resolution, then the Senate shall be considered to have passed 
the joint resolution of the House as amended by the text of the 
Senate joint resolution.

SEC. 907D. SPECIAL RECONCILIATION PROCESS.

  (a) Reporting of Resolutions and Reconciliation Bills and 
Resolutions, in the Senate.--
          (1) Committee alternatives to presidential order.--
        After the submission of an OMB sequestration update 
        report under section 904 of this title that envisions a 
        sequestration under section 902 of this title or 903 of 
        this title, each standing committee of the Senate may, 
        not later than October 10, submit to the Committee on 
        the Budget of the Senate information of the type 
        described in section 632(d) of this title with respect 
        to alternatives to the order envisioned by such report 
        insofar as such order affects laws within the 
        jurisdiction of the committee.
          (2) Initial budget committee action.--After the 
        submission of such a report, the Committee on the 
        Budget of the Senate may, not later than October 15, 
        report to the Senate a resolution. The resolution may 
        affirm the impact of the order envisioned by such 
        report, in whole or in part. To the extent that any 
        part is not affirmed, the resolution shall state which 
        parts are not affirmed and shall contain instructions 
        to committees of the Senate of the type referred to in 
        section 641(a) of this title, sufficient to achieve at 
        least the total level of deficit reduction contained in 
        those sections which are not affirmed.
          (3) Response of committees.--Committees instructed 
        pursuant to paragraph (2), or affected thereby, shall 
        submit their responses to the Budget Committee no later 
        than 10 days after the resolution referred to in 
        paragraph (2) is agreed to, except that if only one 
        such Committee is so instructed such Committee shall, 
        by the same date, report to the Senate a reconciliation 
        bill or reconciliation resolution containing its 
        recommendations in response to such instructions. A 
        committee shall be considered to have complied with all 
        instructions to it pursuant to a resolution adopted 
        under paragraph (2) if it has made recommendations with 
        respect to matters within its jurisdiction which would 
        result in a reduction in the deficit at least equal to 
        the total reduction directed by such instructions.
          (4) Budget committee action.--Upon receipt of the 
        recommendations received in response to a resolution 
        referred to in paragraph (2), the Budget Committee 
        shall report to the Senate a reconciliation bill or 
        reconciliation resolution, or both, carrying out all 
        such recommendations without any substantive revisions. 
        In the event that a committee instructed in a 
        resolution referred to in paragraph (2) fails to submit 
        any recommendation (or, when only one committee is 
        instructed, fails to report a reconciliation bill or 
        resolution) in response to such instructions, the 
        Budget Committee shall include in the reconciliation 
        bill or reconciliation resolution reported pursuant to 
        this subparagraph legislative language within the 
        jurisdiction of the noncomplying committee to achieve 
        the amount of deficit reduction directed in such 
        instructions.
          (5) Point of order.--It shall not be in order in the 
        Senate to consider any reconciliation bill or 
        reconciliation resolution reported under paragraph (4) 
        with respect to a fiscal year, any amendment thereto, 
        or any conference report thereon if--
                  (A) the enactment of such bill or resolution 
                as reported;
                  (B) the adoption and enactment of such 
                amendment; or
                  (C) the enactment of such bill or resolution 
                in the form recommended in such conference 
                report,
        would cause the amount of the deficit for such fiscal 
        year to exceed the maximum deficit amount for such 
        fiscal year, unless the low-growth report submitted 
        under section 904 of this title projects negative real 
        economic growth for such fiscal year, or for each of 
        any two consecutive quarters during such fiscal year.
          (6) Treatment of certain amendments.--In the Senate, 
        an amendment which adds to a resolution reported under 
        paragraph (2) an instruction of the type referred to in 
        such paragraph shall be in order during the 
        consideration of such resolution if such amendment 
        would be in order but for the fact that it would be 
        held to be non-germane on the basis that the 
        instruction constitutes new matter.
          (7) Definition.--For purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), 
        and (3), the term ``day'' shall mean any calendar day 
        on which the Senate is in session.
  (b) Procedures.--
          (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), 
        in the Senate the provisions of sections 636 and 641 of 
        this title for the consideration of concurrent 
        resolutions on the budget and conference reports 
        thereon shall also apply to the consideration of 
        resolutions, and reconciliation bills and 
        reconciliation resolutions reported under this

SEC. 908. MODIFICATION OF PRESIDENTIAL ORDER.

  (a) Introduction of Joint Resolution.--At any time after the 
Director of OMB issues a report under section 901(c)(2) of this 
title for a fiscal year, but before the close of the tenth 
calendar day of session in that session of Congress beginning 
after the date of issuance of such report, the majority leader 
of either House of Congress may introduce a joint resolution 
which contains provisions directing the President to modify the 
most recent order issued under section 902 of this title for 
such fiscal year. After the introduction of the first such 
joint resolution in either House of Congress in any calendar 
year, then no other joint resolution introduced in such House 
in such calendar year shall be subject to the procedures set 
forth in this section.
  (b) Procedures for Consideration of Joint Resolutions.--
          (1) No referral to committee.--A joint resolution 
        introduced in the Senate or the House of 
        Representatives under subsection (a) of this section 
        shall not be referred to a committee of the Senate or 
        the House of Representatives, as the case may be, and 
        shall be placed on the appropriate calendar pending 
        disposition of such joint resolution in accordance with 
        this subsection.
          (2) Immediate consideration.--On or after the third 
        calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
        holidays) beginning after a joint resolution is 
        introduced under subsection (a) of this section, 
        notwithstanding any rule or precedent of the Senate, 
        including Rule 22 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, 
        it is in order (even though a previous motion to the 
        same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of 
        the respective House to move to proceed to the 
        consideration of the joint resolution, and all points 
        of order against the joint resolution (and against 
        consideration of the joint resolution) are waived, 
        except for points of order under titles III [2 U.S.C.A. 
        Sec. 631 et seq.] or IV [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 651 et seq.] 
        of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The motion is 
        not in order after the eighth calendar day (excluding 
        Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after 
        a joint resolution (to which the motion applies) is 
        introduced. The motion is highly privileged in the 
        House of Representatives and is privileged in the 
        Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject 
        to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a 
        motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
        business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the 
        motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in 
        order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
        the joint resolution is agreed to, the respective House 
        shall immediately proceed to consideration of the joint 
        resolution without intervening motion, order, or other 
        business, and the joint resolution shall remain the 
        unfinished business of the respective House until 
        disposed of.
          (3) Debate--
                  (A) In the Senate, debate on a joint 
                resolution introduced under subsection (a) of 
                this section, amendments thereto, and all 
                debatable motions and appeals in connection 
                therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 
                hours, which shall be divided equally between 
                the majority leader and the minority leader (or 
                their designees). In the House, general debate 
                on a joint resolution introduced under 
                subsection (a) of this section shall be limited 
                to not more than 4 hours which shall be equally 
                divided between the majority and minority 
                leaders.
                  (B) A motion to postpone, or a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of other business 
                is not in order. A motion to reconsider the 
                vote by which the joint resolution is agreed to 
                or disagreed to is not in order. In the Senate, 
                a motion to recommit the joint resolution is 
                not in order. In the House, a motion further to 
                limit debate is in order and not debatable. In 
                the House, a motion to recommit is in order.
                  (C)(i) In the House of Representatives, an 
                amendment and any amendment thereto is 
                debatable for not to exceed 30 minutes to be 
                equally divided between the proponent of the 
                amendment and a Member opposed thereto.
                  (ii) No amendment that is not germane or 
                relevant to the provisions of the joint 
                resolution or to the order issued under section 
                902(b)(1) of this title shall be in order in 
                the Senate. In the Senate, an amendment, any 
                amendment to an amendment, or any debatable 
                motion or appeal is debatable for not to exceed 
                30 minutes to be equally divided between the 
                majority leader and the minority leader (or 
                their designees).
                  (iii) In the Senate, an amendment that is 
                otherwise in order shall be in order 
                notwithstanding the fact that it amends the 
                joint resolution in more than one place or 
                amends language previously amended. It shall 
                not be in order in the Senate to vote on the 
                question of agreeing to such a joint resolution 
                or any amendment thereto unless the figures 
                then contained in such joint resolution or 
                amendment are mathematically consistent.
          (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the 
        conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution 
        introduced under subsection (a) of this section, a 
        single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if 
        requested in accordance with the rules of the 
        appropriate House, and the disposition of any 
        amendments under paragraph (3) (except for the motion 
        to recommit in the House of Representatives), the vote 
        on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.
          (5) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair 
        relating to the application of the rules of the Senate 
        or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to 
        the procedure relating to a joint resolution described 
        in subsection (a) of this section shall be decided 
        without debate.
          (6) Conference reports.--In the Senate, points of 
        order under titles III [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 631 et seq.] 
        and IV [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 651 et seq.] of the 
        Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (including points of 
        order under sections 302(c) [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 633(c)], 
        303(a) [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 634(a)], 306 [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 
        637], and 401(b)(1) [2 U.S.C.A. Sec. 651(b)(1)]) are 
        applicable to a conference report on the joint 
        resolution or any amendments in disagreement thereto.
          (7) Resolution from other house.--If, before the 
        passage by the Senate of a joint resolution of the 
        Senate introduced under subsection (a) of this section, 
        the Senate receives from the House of Representatives a 
        joint resolution introduced under subsection (a), of 
        this section, then the following procedures shall 
        apply:
                  (A) The joint resolution of the House of 
                Representatives shall not be referred to a 
                committee.
                  (B) With respect to a joint resolution 
                introduced under subsection (a) of this section 
                in the Senate--
                          (i) the procedure in the Senate shall 
                        be the same as if no joint resolution 
                        had been received from the House; but
                          (ii)(I) the vote on final passage 
                        shall be on the joint resolution of the 
                        House if it is identical to the joint 
                        resolution then pending for passage in 
                        the Senate; or
                          (II) if the joint resolution from the 
                        House is not identical to the joint 
                        resolution then pending for passage in 
                        the Senate and the Senate then passes 
                        it, the Senate shall be considered to 
                        have passed the joint resolution as 
                        amended by the text of the Senate joint 
                        resolution.
                  (C) Upon disposition of the joint resolution 
                received from the House, it shall no longer be 
                in order to consider the resolution originated 
                in the Senate.
          (8) Senate action on house resolution.--If the Senate 
        receives from the House of Representatives a joint 
        resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this 
        section after the Senate has disposed of a Senate 
        originated resolution which is identical to the House 
        passed joint resolution, the action of the Senate with 
        regard to the disposition of the Senate originated 
        joint resolution shall be deemed to be the action of 
        the Senate with regard to the House originated joint 
        resolution. If it is not identical to the House passed 
        joint resolution, then the Senate shall be considered 
        to have passed the joint resolution of the House as 
        amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.

        any determination relating to the qualifications, 
        character, rights, or opportunities of, or benefits to 
        the individual that may be made on the basis of such 
        record, and consequently a determination is made which 
        is adverse to the individual; or
          (D) fails to comply with any other provision of this 
        section, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a 
        way as to have an adverse effect on an individual,
the individual may bring a civil action against the agency, and 
the district courts of the United States shall have 
jurisdiction in the matters under the provisions of this 
subsection.
  (2)(A) In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection 
(g)(1)(A) of this section, the court may order the agency to 
amend the individual's record in accordance with his request or

any case under this paragraph in which the complainant has 
substantially prevailed.

(g)(1)(B) of this section, the court may enjoin the agency from 
withholding the records and order the production to the 
complainant of any agency records improperly withheld from him. 
In such a case the court shall determine the matter de novo, 
and may examine the contents of any agency records in camera to 
determine whether the records or any portion thereof may be 
withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection 
(k) of this section, and the burden is on the agency to sustain 
its action.
  (B) The court may assess against the United States reasonable 
attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in 
any case under this paragraph in which the complainant has 
substantially prevailed.
  (4) In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection

that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or 
willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual in 
an amount equal to the sum of--
          (A) actual damages sustained by the individual as a 
        result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall 
        a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum 
        of $1,000; and
          (B) the costs of the action together with reasonable 
        attorney fees as determined by the court.

his principal place of business, or in which the agency records 
are situated, or in the District of Columbia, without regard to 
the amount in controversy, within two years from the date on 
which the cause of action arises, except that where an agency 
has materially and willfully misrepresented any information 
required under this section to be disclosed to an individual

establishment of the liability of the agency to the individual 
under this section, the action may be brought at any time 
within two years after discovery by the individual of the 
misrepresentation. Nothing in this section shall be construed 
to authorize any civil action by reason of any injury sustained 
as the result of a disclosure of a record prior to September 
27, 1975.

        otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance 
        of such material, such material shall be provided to 
        such individual, except to the extent that the 
        disclosure of such material would reveal the identity

        all records of a recipient agency or a non-Federal 
        agency that the Comptroller General deems necessary in 
        order to monitor or verify compliance with the 
        agreement.
  (2)(A) A copy of each agreement entered into pursuant to 
paragraph (1) shall--
          (i) be transmitted to the Committee on Governmental 
        Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government 
        Operations of the House of Representatives; and
          (ii) be available upon request to the public.
  (B) No such agreement shall be effective until 30 days after 
the date on which such a copy is transmitted pursuant to 
subparagraph (A)(i).
  (C) Such an agreement shall remain in effect only for such 
period, not to exceed 18 months, as the Data Integrity Board of 
the agency determines is appropriate in light of the purposes, 
and length of time necessary for the conduct, of the matching 
program.
  (D) Within 3 months prior to the expiration of such an 
agreement pursuant to subparagraph (C), the Data Integrity 
Board of the agency may, without additional review, renew the 
matching agreement for a current, ongoing matching program for 
not more than one additional year if--
          (i) such program will be conducted without any 
        change; and
          (ii) each party to the agreement certifies to the 
        Board in writing that the program has been conducted in 
        compliance with the agreement.
  (p) Verification and Opportunity To Contest Findings.--(1) In 
order to protect any individual whose records are used in a 
matching program, no recipient agency, non-Federal agency, or 
source agency may suspend, terminate, reduce, or make a final 
denial of any financial assistance or payment under Federal 
benefit program to such individual, or take other adverse 
action against such individual, as a result of information 
produced by such matching program, until--
          (A)(i) the agency has independently verified the 
        information; or
          (ii) the Data Integrity Board of the agency, or in 
        the case of a non-Federal agency the Data Integrity 
        Board of the source agency determines in accordance 
        with guidance issued by the Director of the Office of 
        Management and Budget that--
                  (I) the information is limited to 
                identification and amount of benefits paid by 
                the source agency under a Federal benefit 
                program; and
                  (II) there is a high degree of confidence 
                that the information provided to the recipient 
                agency is accurate;
          (B) the individual receives a notice from the agency 
        containing a statement of its findings and informing 
        the individual of the opportunity to contest such 
        findings; and
          (C)(i) the expiration of any time period established 
        for the program by statute or regulation for the 
        individual to respond to that notice; or
          (ii) in the case of a program for which no such 
        period is established, the end of the 30-day period 
        beginning on the date on which notice under 
        subparagraph (B) is mailed or otherwise provided to the 
        individual.
  (2) Independent verification referred to in paragraph (1) 
requires investigation and confirmation of specific information 
relating to an individual that is used as a basis for an 
adverse action against the individual, including where 
applicable investigation and confirmation of--
          (A) the amount of any asset or income involved;
          (B) whether such individual actually has or had 
        access to such asset or income for such individual's 
        own use; and
          (C) the period or periods when the individual 
        actually had such asset or income.
  (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an agency may take any 
appropriate action otherwise prohibited by such paragraph if 
the agency determines that the public health or public safety 
may be adversely affected or significantly threatened during 
any notice period required by such paragraph.
  (q) Sanctions.--(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, no source agency may disclose any record which is 
contained in a system of records to a recipient agency or non-
Federal agency for a matching program if such source agency has 
reason to believe that the requirements of subsection (p), or 
any matching agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (o), 
or both, are not being met by such recipient agency.
  (2) No source agency may renew a matching agreement unless--
          (A) the recipient agency or non-Federal agency has 
        certified that it has complied with the provisions of 
        that agreement; and
          (B) the source agency has no reason to believe that 
        the certification is inaccurate.
  (r) Report on New Systems and Matching Programs.--Each agency 
that proposes to establish or make a significant change in a 
system of records or a matching program shall provide adequate 
advance notice of any such proposal (in duplicate) to the 
Committee on Government Operations of the House of 
Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the 
Senate, and the Office of Management and Budget in order to 
permit an evaluation of the probable or potential effect of 
such proposal on the privacy or other rights of individuals.
  (s) Biennial Report.--The President shall biennially submit 
to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the 
President pro tempore of the Senate a report--
          (1) describing the actions of the Director of the 
        Office of Management and Budget pursuant to section 6 
        of the Privacy Act of 1974 during the preceding 2

          (2) describing the exercise of individual rights of 
        access and amendment under this section during such 
        years;
          (3) identifying changes in or additions to systems of 
        records;
          (4) containing such other information concerning 
        administration of this section as may be necessary or 
        useful to the Congress in reviewing the effectiveness 
        of this section in carrying out the purposes of the 
        Privacy Act of 1974.
  (t) Effect of Other Laws.--(1) No agency shall rely on any 
exemption contained in section 552 of this title to withhold 
from an individual any record which is otherwise accessible to 
such individual under the provisions of this section.
  (2) No agency shall rely on any exemption in this section to 
withhold from an individual any record which is otherwise 
accessible to such individual under the provisions of section 
552 of this title.
  (u) Data Integrity Boards.--(1) Every agency conducting or 
participating in a matching program shall establish a Data 
Integrity Board to oversee and coordinate among the various

officials designated by the head of the agency, and shall 
include any senior official designated by the head of the 
agency as responsible for implementation of this section, and 
the inspector general of the agency, if any. The inspector 
general shall not serve as chairman of the Data Integrity 
Board.

          (A) shall review, approve, and maintain all written 
        agreements for receipt or disclosure of agency records 
        for matching programs to ensure compliance with 
        subsection (o), and all relevant statutes, regulations, 
        and guidelines;
          (B) shall review all matching programs in which the 
        agency has participated during the year, either as a 
        source agency or recipient agency, determine compliance 
        with applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, and 
        agency agreements, and assess the costs and benefits of 
        such programs;
          (C) shall review all recurring matching programs in 
        which the agency has participated during the year, 
        either as a source agency or recipient agency, for 
        continued justification for such disclosures;
          (D) shall compile an annual report, which shall be 
        submitted to the head of the agency and the Office of 
        Management and Budget and made available to the public 
        on request, describing the matching activities of the 
        agency, including--
                  (i) matching programs in which the agency has 
                participated as a source agency or recipient 
                agency;
                  (ii) matching agreements proposed under 
                subsection (o) that were disapproved by the 
                Board;
                  (iii) any changes in membership or structure 
                of the Board in the preceding year;
                  (iv) the reasons for any waiver of the 
                requirement in paragraph (4) of this section 
                for completion and submission of a cost-benefit 
                analysis prior to the approval of a matching 
                program;
                  (v) any violations of matching agreements 
                that have been alleged or identified and any 
                corrective action taken; and
                  (vi) any other information required by the 
                Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
                to be included in such report;
          (E) shall serve as a clearinghouse for receiving and 
        providing information on the accuracy, completeness, 
        and reliability of records used in matching programs;
          (F) shall provide interpretation and guidance to 
        agency components and personnel on the requirements of 
        this section for matching programs;
          (G) shall review agency recordkeeping and disposal

        compliance with this section; and
          (H) may review and report on any agency matching 
        activities that are not matching programs.
  (4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a 
Data Integrity Board shall not approve any written agreement 
for a matching program unless the agency has completed and 
submitted to such Board a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed 
program and such analysis demonstrates that the program is 
likely to be cost effective.
  (B) The Board may waive the requirements of subparagraph (A) 
of this paragraph if it determines in writing, in accordance 
with guidelines prescribed by the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, that a cost-benefit analysis is not 
required.
  (C) A cost-benefit analysis shall not be required under 
subparagraph (A) prior to the initial approval of a written 
agreement for a matching program that is specifically required 
by statute. Any subsequent written agreement for such a program 
shall not be approved by the Data Integrity Board unless the 
agency has submitted a cost-benefit analysis of the program as 
conducted under the preceding approval of such agreement.
  (5)(A) If a matching agreement is disapproved by a Data 
Integrity Board, any party to such agreement may appeal the 
disapproval to the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget. Timely notice of the filing of such an appeal shall be 
provided by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the 
Committee on Government Operations of the House of 
Representatives.
  (B) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget may 
approve a matching agreement notwithstanding the disapproval of 
a Data Integrity Board if the Director determines that--
          (i) the matching program will be consistent with all 
        applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements;
          (ii) there is adequate evidence that the matching 
        agreement will be cost-effective; and
          (iii) the matching program is in the public interest.
  (C) The decision of the Director to approve a matching 
agreement shall not take effect until 30 days after it is 
reported to committees described in subparagraph (A).
  (D) If the Data Integrity Board and the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget disapprove a matching program 
proposed by the inspector general of an agency, the inspector 
general may report the disapproval to the head of the agency 
and to the Congress.
  (6) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
shall, annually during the first 3 years after the date of 
enactment of this subsection and biennially thereafter, 
consolidate in a report to the Congress the information 
contained in the reports from the various Data Integrity Boards 
under paragraph (3)(D). Such report shall include detailed 
information about costs and benefits of matching programs that 
are conducted during the period covered by such consolidated 
report, and shall identify each waiver granted by a Data 
Integrity Board of the requirement for completion and 
submission of a cost-benefit analysis and the reasons for 
granting the waiver.
  (7) In the reports required by paragraphs (3)(D) and (6), 
agency matching activities that are not matching programs may 
be reported on an aggregate basis, if and to the extent 
necessary to protect ongoing law enforcement or 
counterintelligence investigations.
  (v) Office of Management and Budget Responsibilities.--The 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall--
          (1) develop and, after notice and opportunity for 
        public comment, prescribe guidelines and regulations

        of this section; and
          (2) provide continuing assistance to and oversight of 
        the implementation of this section by agencies.

                   CHAPTER 14A--AID TO SMALL BUSINESS

SEC. 644. AWARDS OR CONTRACTS

  (a) Determination.--To effectuate the purposes of this 
chapter, small-business concerns within the meaning of this 
chapter shall receive any award or contract or any part 
thereof, and be awarded any contract for the sale of Government 
property, as to which it is determined by the Administration 
and the contracting procurement or disposal agency (1) to be in 
the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full 
productive capacity, (2) to be in the interest of war or 
national defense programs, (3) to be in the interest of 
assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and 
contracts for property and services for the Government in each 
industry category are placed with small-business concerns, or 
(4) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of 
the total sales of Government property be made to small-
business concerns; but nothing contained in this chapter shall 
be construed to change any preferences or priorities 
established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power 
or other property by the Government or any agency thereof. 
These determinations may be made for individual awards or 
contracts or for classes of awards or contracts. If a proposed 
procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services 
currently being performed by a small business, and if the 
proposed procurement is in a quantity or estimated dollar value 
the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract 
participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for 
construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete 
construction projects, the Procurement Activity shall provide a 
copy of the proposed procurement to the Procurement Activity's 
Small Business Procurement Center Representative at least 30 
days prior to the solicitation's issuance along with a 
statement explaining (1) why the proposed acquisition cannot be 
divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic 
production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the 
total requirement, (2) why delivery schedules cannot be 
established on a realistic basis that will encourage small 
business participation to the extent consistent with the actual 
requirements of the Government, (3) why the proposed 
acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business 
participation likely, or (4) why construction cannot be 
procured as separate discrete projects. The thirty-day 
notification process shall occur concurrently with other 
processing steps required prior to issuance of the 
solicitation. Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed 
procurement and accompanying statement, if the Procurement 
Center Representative believes that the procurement as proposed 
will render small business prime contract participation 
unlikely, the Representative shall recommend to the Procurement 
Activity alternative procurement methods which would increase 
small business prime contracting opportunities. Whenever the 
Administration and the contracting procurement agency fail to 
agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the 
Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency 
by the Administrator. For purposes of clause (3) of the first 
sentence of this subsection, an industry category is a discrete 
group of similar goods and services. Such groups shall be 
determined by the Administration in accordance with the four-
digit standard industrial classification codes contained in the 
Standard Industrial Classification Manual published by the 
Office of Management and Budget, except that the Administration 
shall limit such an industry category to a greater extent than 
provided under such classification codes if the Administration 
receives evidence indicating that further segmentation for 
purposes of this paragraph is warranted due to special capital 
equipment needs or special labor or geographic requirements or 
to recognize a new industry. A market for goods or services may 
not be segmented under the preceding sentence due to geographic 
requirements unless the Government typically designates the 
area where work for contracts for such goods or services is to 
be performed and Government purchases comprise the major 
portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or 
services and, due to the fixed location of facilities, high 
mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it is 
unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns 
located outside of the general areas where such concerns are 
located. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if 
the award of the contract would result in a cost to the 
awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price.
  (b) Placement of Contracts by Contracting Procurement 
Agency.--With respect to any work to be performed the amount of 
which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which 
a surety may be guaranteed against loss under section 694b of 
this title, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the 
extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than 
one small business concern to perform such work.
  (c) Programs for Blind and Handicapped Individuals.--(1) As 
used in this subsection:
          (A) The term ``Committee'' means the Committee for 
        Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled 
        established under section 46 of Title 41.
          (B) The term ``public or private organization for the 
        handicapped'' has the same meaning given such term in 
        section 3(e).
          (C) The term ``handicapped individual'' has the same 
        meaning given such term in section 632(f) of this 
        title.
  (2)(A) During fiscal year 1995, public or private 
organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to 
participate in programs authorized under this section in an 
aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.
  (B) None of the amounts authorized for participation by 
subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list 
maintained by the Committee pursuant to section 47 of Title 41.
  (3) The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such 
participation.
  (4)(A) Not later than ten days after the announcement of a 
proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a 
public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-
profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely 
to experience severe economic injury as the result of the 
proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with 
the Administrator.
  (B) If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award 
under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after 
consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, 
finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to 
experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed 
award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the 
appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and 
department having procurement powers to take such action as may 
be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely 
to be sustained by the concern.
  (5) Each agency and department having procurement powers 
shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each 
time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, 
and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher 
bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The 
Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data 
reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal 
procurement data system and shall report to the Administration 
which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the 
maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has 
been made during any fiscal year.
  (6) For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be 
awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor 
performed on each item being produced under the contract in the 
sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of 
service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is 
performed by handicapped individuals.
  (7) Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an 
organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may 
use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.
  (d) Priority.--For purposes of this section priority shall be 
given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of 
subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a 
substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and 
subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or 
underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding 
any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides 
pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. 
Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the 
Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is 
a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a 
sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be 
made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the 
extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, 
consideration shall be given to those persons who would be 
available for employment were suitable employment available. 
Until such definition reflects such number, the present 
criteria of such policy shall govern.
  (e), (f) Repealed.--Pub. L. 103-355, Title VII, Sec. 7101(a), 
Oct. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 3367
  (g) Goals for Participation of Small Business Concerns in 
Procurement Contracts.--
          (1) The President shall annually establish 
        Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded 
        to small business concerns, small business concerns 
        owned and controlled by socially and economically 
        disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns 
        owned and controlled by women. The Government-wide goal 
        for participation by small business concerns shall be 
        established at not less than 20 percent of the total 
        value of all prime contract awards for each fiscal 
        year. The Government-wide goal for participation by 
        small business concerns owned and controlled by 
        socially and economically disadvantaged individuals 
        shall be established at not less than 5 percent of the 
        total value of all prime contract and subcontract 
        awards for each fiscal year. The Government-wide goal 
        for participation by small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by women shall be established at not less 
        than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract 
        and subcontract awards for each fiscal year. 
        Notwithstanding the Government-wide goal, each agency 
        shall have an annual goal that presents, for that 
        agency, the maximum practicable opportunity for small 
        business concerns, small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals, and small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by women to participate in the performance 
        of contracts let by such agency. The Administration and 
        the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement 
        Policy shall, when exercising their authority pursuant 
        to paragraph (2), insure that the cumulative annual 
        prime contract goals for all agencies meet or exceed 
        the annual Government-wide prime contract goal 
        established by the President pursuant to this 
        paragraph.
          (2) The head of each Federal agency shall, after 
        consultation with the Administration, establish goals 
        for the participation by small business concerns, owned 
        and controlled by socially and economically 
        disadvantaged individuals, and by small business 
        concerns owned and controlled by women in procurement 
        contracts of such agency. Goals established under this 
        subsection shall be jointly established by the 
        Administration and the head of each Federal agency and 
        shall realistically reflect the potential of small 
        business concerns, small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals, and small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by women to perform such contracts and to 
        perform subcontracts under such contracts. Whenever the 
        Administration and the head of any Federal agency fail 
        to agree on established goals, the disagreement shall 
        be submitted to the Administrator of the Office of 
        Federal Procurement Policy for final determination. For 
        the purpose of establishing goals under this 
        subsection, the head of each Federal agency shall make 
        consistent efforts to annually expand participation by 
        small business concerns from each industry category in 
        procurement contracts of the agency, including 
        participation by small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals and participation by small business 
        concerns owned and controlled by women. The head of 
        each Federal agency, in attempting to attain such 
        participation, shall consider--
                  (A) contracts awarded as the result of 
                unrestricted competition; and
                  (B) contracts awarded after competition 
                restricted to eligible small business concerns 
                under this section and under the program 
                established under section 637(a) of this title.
  (h) Reports to Administration; Submittal of Information To 
Congress.--
          (1) At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the head 
        of each Federal agency shall report to the 
        Administration on the extent of participation by small 
        business concerns, small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals, and small business concerns owned and 
        controlled by women in procurement contracts of such 
        agency. Such reports shall contain appropriate 
        justifications for failure to meet the goals 
        established under subsection (g) of this section.
          (2) The Administration shall annually compile and 
        analyze the reports submitted by the individual 
        agencies pursuant to paragraph (1) and shall submit 
        them to the President. The Administration's submission 
        to the President shall include the following:
                  (A) The Government-wide goals for 
                participation by small business concerns, small 
                business concerns owned and controlled by 
                socially and economically disadvantaged 
                individuals, and small business concerns owned 
                and controlled by women and the performance in 
                attaining such goals.
                  (B) The goals in effect for each agency and 
                the agency's performance in attaining such 
                goals.
                  (C) An analysis of any failure to achieve the 
                Government-wide goals or any individual agency 
                goals and the actions planned by such agency 
                (and approved by the Administration) to achieve 
                the goals in the succeeding fiscal year.
                  (D) The number and the dollar value of 
                contracts awarded to small business concerns, 
                small business concerns owned and controlled by 
                socially and economically disadvantaged 
                individuals, and small business concerns owned 
                and controlled by women through--
                          (i) noncompetitive negotiation,
                          (ii) competition restricted to small 
                        business concerns owned and controlled 
                        by socially and economically 
                        disadvantaged individuals,
                          (iii) competition restricted to small 
                        business concerns, and
                          (iv) unrestricted competitions, for 
                        each agency and on a Government-wide 
                        basis.
                  (E) The number and dollar value of 
                subcontracts awarded to small business 
                concerns, small business concerns owned and 
                controlled by socially and economically 
                disadvantaged individuals, and small business 
                concerns owned and controlled by women.
                  (F) The number and dollar value of prime 
                contracts and subcontracts awarded to small 
                business concerns owned and controlled by 
                women.
          (3) The President shall include the information 
        required by paragraph (2) in each annual report to the 
        Congress on the state of small business prepared 
        pursuant to section 631b(a) of this title.
  (i) Small Business Set-asides.--Nothing in this chapter or 
any other provision of law precludes exclusive small business 
set-asides for procurements of architectural and engineering 
services, research, development, test and evaluation, and each 
Federal agency is authorized to develop such set-asides to 
further the interests of small business in those areas.
  (j) Small Business Reservation.--
          (1) Each contract for the purchase of goods and 
        services that has an anticipated value greater than 
        $2,500 but not greater than $100,000 shall be reserved 
        exclusively for small business concerns unless the 
        contracting officer is unable to obtain offers from two 
        or more small business concerns that are competitive 
        with market prices and are competitive with regard to 
        the quality and delivery of the goods or services being 
        purchased.
          (2) In carrying out paragraph (1), a contracting 
        officer shall consider a responsive offer timely 
        received from an eligible small business offeror.
          (3) Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed as 
        precluding an award of a contract with a value not 
        greater than $100,000 under the authority of subsection 
        (a) of section 637 of this title, section 2323 of Title 
        10, section 712 of the Business Opportunity Development 
        Reform Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-656; 15 U.S.C. 644 
        note), or section 7102 of the Federal Acquisition 
        Streamlining Act of 1994.
  (k) Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization; 
Director.--There is hereby established in each Federal agency 
having procurement powers an office to be known as the ``Office 
of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization''. The 
management of each such office shall be vested in an officer or 
employee of such agency who shall--
          (1) be known as the ``Director of Small and 
        Disadvantaged Business Utilization'' for such agency,
          (2) be appointed by the head of such agency,
          (3) be responsible only to, and report directly to, 
        the head of such agency or to the deputy of such head, 
        except that the director for the Office of the 
        Secretary of Defense shall be responsible only to, and 
        report directly to, such Secretary or the Secretary's 
        designee,
          (4) be responsible for the implementation and 
        execution of the functions and duties under this 
        section and section 637 of this title which relate to 
        such agency,
          (5) assist small business concerns to obtain 
        payments, required late payment interest penalties, or 
        information regarding payments due to such concerns 
        from an executive agency or a contractor, in conformity 
        with chapter 39 of Title 31 or any other protection for 
        contractors or subcontractors (including suppliers) 
        that is included in the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
        or any individual agency supplement to such Government-
        wide regulation,
          (6) have supervisory authority over personnel of such 
        agency to the extent that the functions and duties of 
        such personnel relate to functions and duties under 
        this section and section 637 of this title,
          (7) assign a small business technical adviser to each 
        office to which the Administration has assigned a 
        procurement center representative--
                  (A) who shall be a full-time employee of the 
                procuring activity and shall be well qualified, 
                technically trained and familiar with the 
                supplies or services purchased at the activity, 
                and
                  (B) whose principal duty shall be to assist 
                the Administration procurement center 
                representative in his duties and functions 
                relating to this section and section 637 of 
                this title, and
          (8) cooperate, and consult on a regular basis, with 
        the Administration with respect to carrying out the 
        functions and duties described in paragraph (4) of this 
        subsection, and
          (9) make recommendations to contracting officers as 
        to whether a particular contract requirement should be 
        awarded pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or 
        section 637(a) of this title or section 2323 of Title 
        10. Such recommendations shall be made with due regard 
        to the requirements of subsection (m) of this section, 
        and the failure of the contracting officer to accept 
        any such recommendations shall be documented and 
        included within the appropriate contract file. This 
        subsection shall not apply to the Administration.
  (l) Breakout Procurement Center Representatives.--(1) The 
Administration shall assign to each major procurement center a 
breakout procurement center representative with such assistance 
as may be appropriate. The breakout procurement center 
representative shall carry out the activities described in 
paragraph (2), and shall be an advocate for the breakout of 
items for procurement through full and open competition, 
whenever appropriate, while maintaining the integrity of the 
system in which such items are used, and an advocate for the 
use of full and open competition, whenever appropriate, for the 
procurement of supplies and services by such center. Any 
breakout procurement center representative assigned under this 
subsection shall be in addition to the representative referred 
to in subsection (k)(6) of this section.
    (2) In addition to carrying out the responsibilities 
assigned by the Administration, a breakout procurement center 
representative is authorized to--
          (A) attend any provisioning conference or similar 
        evaluation session during which determinations are made 
        as to whether requirements are to be procured through 
        other than full and open competition and make 
        recommendations with respect to such requirements to 
        the members of such conference or session;
          (B) review, at any time, restrictions on competition 
        previously imposed on items through acquisition method 
        coding or similar procedures, and recommend to 
        personnel of the appropriate activity the prompt 
        reevaluation of such limitations;
          (C) review restrictions on competition arising out of 
        restrictions on the rights of the United States in 
        technical data, and, when appropriate, recommend that 
        personnel of the appropriate activity initiate a review 
        of the validity of such an asserted restriction;
          (D) obtain from any governmental source, and make 
        available to personnel of the appropriate activity, 
        technical data necessary for the preparation of a 
        competitive solicitation package for any item of supply 
        or service previously procured noncompetitively due to 
        the unavailability of such technical data;
          (E) have access to procurement records and other data 
        of the procurement center commensurate with the level 
        of such representative's approved security clearance 
        classification;
          (F) receive unsolicited engineering proposals and, 
        when appropriate (i) conduct a value analysis of such 
        proposal to determine whether such proposal, if 
        adopted, will result in lower costs to the United 
        States without substantially impeding legitimate 
        acquisition objectives and forward to personnel of the 
        appropriate activity recommendations with respect to 
        such proposal, or (ii) forward such proposals without 
        analysis to personnel of the activity responsible for 
        reviewing such proposals and who shall furnish the 
        breakout procurement center representative with 
        information regarding the disposition of any such 
        proposal; and
          (G) review the systems that account for the 
        acquisition and management of technical data within the 
        procurement center to assure that such systems provide 
        the maximum availability and access to data needed for 
        the preparation of offers to sell to the United States 
        those supplies to which such data pertain which 
        potential offerors are entitled to receive.
    (3) A breakout procurement center representative is 
authorized to appeal the failure to act favorably on any 
recommendation made pursuant to paragraph (2). Such appeal 
shall be filed and processed in the same manner and subject to 
the same conditions and limitations as an appeal filed by the 
Administrator pursuant to subsection (a).
    (4) The Administration shall assign and co-locate at least 
two small business technical advisers to each major procurement 
center in addition to such other advisers as may be authorized 
from time to time. The sole duties of such advisers shall be to 
assist the breakout procurement center representative for the 
center to which such advisers are assigned in carrying out the 
functions described in paragraph (2) and the representatives 
referred to in subsection (k)(6) of this section.
    (5)(A) The breakout procurement center representatives and 
technical advisers assigned pursuant to this subsection shall 
be--
          (i) full-time employees of the Administration; and
          (ii) fully qualified, technically trained, and 
        familiar with the supplies and services procured by the 
        major procurement center to which they are assigned.
    (B) In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (A), 
each breakout procurement center representative, and at least 
one technical adviser assigned to such representative, shall be 
an accredited engineer.
    (C) The Administration shall establish personnel positions 
for breakout procurement representatives and advisers assigned 
pursuant to this subsection, which are classified at a grade 
level of the General Schedule sufficient to attract and retain 
highly qualified personnel.
    (6) For purposes of this subsection, the term ``major 
procurement center'' means a procurement center that, in the 
opinion of the Administrator, purchases substantial dollar 
amounts of other than commercial items and which has the 
potential to incur significant savings as the result of the 
placement of a breakout procurement center representative.
    (7)(A) At such times as the Administrator deems 
appropriate, the breakout procurement center representative 
shall conduct familiarization sessions for contracting officers 
and other appropriate personnel of the procurement center to 
which such representative is assigned. Such sessions shall 
acquaint the participants with the provisions of this 
subsection and shall instruct them in methods designed to 
further the purposes of such subsection.
    (B) The breakout procurement center representative shall 
prepare and personally deliver an annual briefing and report to 
the head of the procurement center to which such representative 
is assigned. Such briefing and report shall detail the past and 
planned activities of the representative and shall contain such 
recommendations for improvement in the operation of the center 
as may be appropriate. The head of such center shall personally 
receive such briefing and report and shall, within sixty 
calendar days after receipt, respond, in writing, to each 
recommendation made by such representative.
  (m) Relationship to Other Procurement Programs.--
          (1) Each agency subject to the requirements of 
        section 2323 of Title 10 shall, when implementing such 
        requirements--
                  (A) establish policies and procedures that 
                insure that there will be no reduction in the 
                number of dollar value of contracts awarded 
                pursuant to this section and section 637(a) of 
                this title in order to achieve any goal or 
                other program objective; and
                  (B) assure that such requirements will not 
                alter or change the procurement process used to 
                implement this section or section 637(a) of 
                this title.
          (2) All procurement center representatives (including 
        those referred to in subsection (k)(6) of this 
        section), in addition to such other duties as may be 
        assigned by the Administrator, shall--
                  (A) monitor the performance of the 
                procurement activities to which they are 
                assigned to ascertain the degree of compliance 
                with the requirements of paragraph (1);
                  (B) report to their immediate supervisors all 
                instances of noncompliance with such 
                requirements; and
                  (C) increase, insofar as possible, the number 
                and dollar value of procurements that may be 
                used for the programs established under this 
                section, section 637(a) of this title, and 
                section 2323 of Title 10.
  (n) Determination of Labor Surplus Areas.--For purposes of 
this section, the determination of labor surplus areas shall be 
made on the basis of the criteria in effect at the time of the 
determination, except that any minimum population criteria 
shall not exceed twenty-five thousand. Such determination, as 
modified by the preceding sentence, shall be made by the 
Secretary of Labor.
  (o) Costs of Contract Performance and Manufacturing.--
          (1) A concern may not be awarded a contract under 
        subsection (a) as a small business concern unless the 
        concern agrees that--
                  (A) in the case of a contract for services 
                (except construction), at least 50 percent of 
                the cost of contract performance incurred for 
                personnel shall be expended for employees of 
                the concern; and
                  (B) in the case of a contract for procurement 
                of supplies (other than procurement from a 
                regular dealer in such supplies), the concern 
                will perform work for at least 50 percent of 
                the cost of manufacturing the supplies (not 
                including the cost of materials).
          (2) The Administrator may change the percentage under 
        subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) if the 
        Administrator determines that such change is necessary 
        to reflect conventional industry practices among 
        business concerns that are below the numerical size 
        standard for businesses in that industry category.
          (3) The Administration shall establish, through 
        public rulemaking, requirements similar to those 
        specified in paragraph (1) to be applicable to 
        contracts for general and specialty construction and to 
        contracts for any other industry category not otherwise 
        subject to the requirements of such paragraph. The 
        percentage applicable to any such requirement shall be 
        determined in accordance with paragraph (2).

        performance expressed as a tangible, measurable 
        objective, against which actual achievement shall be 
        compared, including a goal expressed as a quantitative 
        standard, value, or rate;
          (4) ``performance indicator'' refers to a particular

        related goals and objectives, for the major functions 
        and operations of the Postal Service;
          (3) a description of how the goals and objectives are 
        to be achieved, including a description of the 
        operational processes, skills and technology, and the 
        human, capital, information, and other resources 
        required to meet those goals and objectives;
          (4) a description of how the performance goals 
        included in the plan required under section 2803 shall 
        be related to the general goals and objectives in the 
        strategic plan;
          (5) an identification of those key factors external 
        to the Postal Service and beyond its control that could

and shall advise the Congress of the contents of the plan.

SEC. 2803. PERFORMANCE PLANS.

  (a) The Postal Service shall prepare an annual performance 
plan covering each program activity set forth in the Postal 
Service budget, which shall be included in the comprehensive 
statement presented under section 2401(g) of this title. Such 
plan shall--
          (1) establish performance goals to define the level 
        of performance to be achieved by a program activity;
          (2) express such goals in an objective, quantifiable, 
        and measurable form unless an alternative form is used 
        under subsection (b);
          (3) briefly describe the operational processes, 
        skills and technology, and the human, capital, 
        information, or other resources required to meet the 
        performance goals;
          (4) establish performance indicators to be used in 
        measuring or assessing the relevant outputs, service 
        levels, and outcomes of each program activity;
          (5) provide a basis for comparing actual program 
        results with the established performance goals; and
          (6) describe the means to be used to verify and 
        validate measured values.
  (b) If the Postal Service determines that it is not feasible 
to express the performance goals for a particular program 
activity in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form, 
the Postal Service may use an alternative form. Such 
alternative form shall--
          (1) include separate descriptive statements of--
                  (A) a minimally effective program, and
                  (B) a successful program,
        with sufficient precision and in such terms that would 
        allow for an accurate, independent determination of 
        whether the program activity's performance meets the 
        criteria of either description; or
          (2) state why it is infeasible or impractical to 
        express a performance goal in any form for the program 
        activity.
  (c) In preparing a comprehensive and informative plan under 
this section, the Postal Service may aggregate, disaggregate, 
or consolidate program activities, except that any aggregation 
or consolidation may not omit or minimize the significance of 
any program activity constituting a major function or 
operation.
  (d) The Postal Service may prepare a non-public annex to its 
plan covering program activities or parts of program activities 
relating to--
          (1) the avoidance of interference with criminal 
        prosecution; or
          (2) matters otherwise exempt from public disclosure 
        under section 410(c) of this title.

SEC. 2804. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE REPORTS.

  (a) The Postal Service shall prepare a report on program 
performance for each fiscal year, which shall be included in 
the annual comprehensive statement presented under section 
2401(g) of this title.
  (b)(1) The program performance report shall set forth the 
performance indicators established in the Postal Service 
performance plan, along with the actual program performance 
achieved compared with the performance goals expressed in the 
plan for that fiscal year.
  (2) If performance goals are specified by descriptive 
statements of a minimally effective program activity and a 
successful program activity, the results of such program shall 
be described in relationship to those categories, including 
whether the performance failed to meet the criteria of either 
category.
  (c) The report for fiscal year 2000 shall include actual 
results for the preceding fiscal year, the report for fiscal 
year 2001 shall include actual results for the two preceding 
fiscal years, and the report for fiscal year 2002 and all 
subsequent reports shall include actual results for the three 
preceding fiscal years.
  (d) Each report shall--
          (1) review the success of achieving the performance 
        goals of the fiscal year;
          (2) evaluate the performance plan for the current 
        fiscal year relative to the performance achieved 
        towards the performance goals in the fiscal year 
        covered by the report;
          (3) explain and describe, where a performance goal 
        has not been met (including when a program activity's 
        performance is determined not to have met the criteria 
        of a successful program activity under section 
        2803(b)(2))--
                  (A) why the goal was not met;
                  (B) those plans and schedules for achieving 
                the established performance goal; and
                  (C) if the performance goal is impractical or 
                infeasible, why that is the case and what 
                action is recommended; and
          (4) include the summary findings of those program 
        evaluations completed during the fiscal year covered by 
        the report.

SEC. 2805. INHERENTLY GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS.

  The functions and activities of this chapter shall be 
considered to be inherently Governmental functions. The 
drafting of strategic plans, performance plans, and program 
performance reports under this section shall be performed only 
by employees of the Postal Service.

        professional accounting organizations, contractors, and 
        other interested parties--
                  (i) the probable costs of implementation, 
                including inflationary effects, if any, 
                compared to the probable benefits;
                  (ii) the advantages, disadvantages, and

        Comptroller General may make; and
          (D) publish a notice of such proposed rulemaking in 
        the Federal Register and provide all parties affected a 
        period of not less than 60 days after such publication 
        to submit their views and comments.
    (2) Rules, regulations, cost accounting standards, and 
modifications thereof promulgated or amended under this section 
shall have the full force and effect of law, and shall become 
effective within 120 days after publication in the Federal 
Register in final form, unless the Board determines a longer 
period is necessary. Implementation dates for contractors and 
subcontractors shall be determined by the Board, but in no 
event shall such dates be later than the beginning of the 
second fiscal year of the contractor or subcontractor after the 
standard becomes effective. Rules, regulations, cost accounting 
standards, and modifications thereof promulgated or amended 
under this section shall be accompanied by prefatory comments 
and by illustrations, if necessary.
    (3) The functions exercised under this section are excluded

through 706 of Title 5.
  (h) Implementing Regulations.--(1) The Board shall promulgate 
rules and regulations for the implementation of cost accounting 
standards promulgated or interpreted under subsection (f) of 
this section. Such regulations shall be incorporated into the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation and shall require contractors 
and subcontractors as a condition of contracting with the 
United States to--
          (A) disclose in writing their cost accounting 
        practices, including methods of distinguishing direct 
        costs from indirect costs and the basis used for 
        allocating indirect costs; and
          (B) agree to a contract price adjustment, with 
        interest, for any increased costs paid to such 
        contractor or subcontractor by the United States by 
        reason of a change in the contractor's or 
        subcontractor's cost accounting practices or by reason 
        of a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to 
        comply with applicable cost accounting standards.
  (2) If the United States and a contractor or subcontractor 
fail to agree on a contract price adjustment, including whether 
the contractor or subcontractor has complied with the 
applicable cost accounting standards, the disagreement will 
constitute a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 
601).
  (3) Any contract price adjustment undertaken pursuant to 
paragraph (1)(B) shall be made, where applicable, on relevant 
contracts between the United States and the contractor that are 
subject to the cost accounting standards so as to protect the 
United States from payment, in the aggregate, of increased 
costs (as defined by the Board). In no case shall the 
Government recover costs greater than the increased cost (as 
defined by the Board) to the Government, in the aggregate, on 
the relevant contracts subject to the price adjustment, unless 
the contractor made a change in its cost accounting practices 
of which it was aware or should have been aware at the time of 
the price negotiation and which it failed to disclose to the 
Government.
  (4) The interest rate applicable to any contract price 
adjustment shall be the annual rate of interest established 
under section 6621 of Title 26 for such period. Such interest 
shall accrue from the time payments of the increased costs were 
made to the contractor or subcontractor to the time the United 
States receives full compensation for the price adjustment.
  (i) Reports to Congress.--The Board shall report to the 
Congress not later than one year after November 17, 1988, and 
annually thereafter, with respect to the activities and 
operations of the Board under this section, together with such 
recommendations as it considers appropriate.
  (j) Effect on Other Standards and Regulations.--(1) All cost 
accounting standards, waivers, exemptions, interpretations, 
modifications, rules, and regulations promulgated by the Cost 
Accounting Standards Board under section 2168 of this Appendix 
to Title 5 (50 U.S.C. App. 2168) shall remain in effect unless 
and until amended, superseded, or rescinded by the Board 
pursuant to this section.
  (2) Existing cost accounting standards referred to in 
paragraph (1) shall be subject to the provisions of this Act in 
the same manner as if promulgated by the Board under this 
chapter.
  (3) The Administrator, under the authority set forth in 
section 405 of this title, shall ensure that no regulation or 
proposed regulation of an executive agency is inconsistent with 
a cost accounting standard promulgated or amended under this 
section by rescinding or denying the promulgation of any such 
inconsistent regulation or proposed regulation and taking such 
other action authorized under section 405 of this title as may 
be appropriate.
  (4) Costs which are the subject of cost accounting standards 
promulgated under this section shall not be subject to 
regulations that are established by another executive agency 
that differ from such standards with respect to the 
measurement, assignment, and allocation of such costs.
  (k) Examinations.--For the purpose of determining whether a 
contractor or subcontractor has complied with cost accounting 
standards promulgated under this section and has followed 
consistently the contractor's or subcontractor's disclosed cost 
accounting practices, any authorized representative of the head 
of the agency concerned, of the offices of inspector general 
established pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, or 
of the Comptroller General of the United States shall have the 
right to examine and make copies of any documents, papers, or 
records of such contractor or subcontractor relating to 
compliance with such cost accounting standards.
  (l) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to 
be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the 
provisions of this section.

SEC. 605. DECISION BY CONTRACTING OFFICER.

  (a) Contractor Claims.--All claims by a contractor against 
the government relating to a contract shall be in writing and 
shall be submitted to the contracting officer for a decision. 
All claims by the government against a contractor relating to a 
contract shall be the subject of a decision by the contracting 
officer. Each claim by a contractor against the government 
relating to a contract and each claim by the government against 
a contractor relating to a contract shall be submitted within 6 
years after the accrual of the claim. The preceding sentence 
does not apply to a claim by the government against a 
contractor that is based on a claim by the contractor involving 
fraud. The contracting officer shall issue his decisions in 
writing, and shall mail or otherwise furnish a copy of the 
decision to the contractor. The decision shall state the 
reasons for the decision reached, and shall inform the 
contractor of his rights as provided in this chapter. Specific 
findings of fact are not required, but, if made, shall not be 
binding in any subsequent proceeding. The authority of this 
subsection shall not extend to a claim or dispute for penalties 
or forfeitures prescribed by statute or regulation which 
another Federal agency is specifically authorized to 
administer, settle, or determine. This section shall not 
authorize any agency head to settle, compromise, pay, or 
otherwise adjust any claim involving fraud.
  (b) Review; Performance of Contract Pending Appeal.--The 
contracting officer's decision on the claim shall be final and 
conclusive and not subject to review by any forum, tribunal, or 
Government agency, unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced 
as authorized by this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall 
prohibit executive agencies from including a clause in 
government contracts requiring that pending final decision of 
an appeal, action, or final settlement, a contractor shall 
proceed diligently with performance of the contract in 
accordance with the contracting officer's decision.
  (c) Amount of Claim; Certification; Notification; Time of 
Issuance; Presumption; Authorization of Certifier.--(1) A 
contracting officer shall issue a decision on any submitted 
claim of $100,000 or less within sixty days from his receipt of 
a written request from the contractor that a decision be 
rendered within that period. For claims of more than $100,000, 
the contractor shall certify that the claim is made in good 
faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to 
the best of his knowledge and belief, that the amount requested 
accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the 
contractor believes the government is liable, and that the 
certifier is duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of 
the contractor.
  (2) A contracting officer shall, within sixty days of receipt 
of a submitted certified claim over $100,000--
          (A) issue a decision; or
          (B) notify the contractor of the time within which a 
        decision will be issued.
  (3) The decision of a contracting officer on submitted claims 
shall be issued within a reasonable time, in accordance with 
regulations promulgated by the agency, taking into account such 
factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the 
adequacy of the information in support of the claim provided by 
the contractor.
  (4) A contractor may request the tribunal concerned to direct 
a contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period 
of time, as determined by the tribunal concerned, in the event 
of undue delay on the part of the contracting officer.
  (5) Any failure by the contracting officer to issue a 
decision on a contract claim within the period required will be 
deemed to be a decision by the contracting officer denying the 
claim and will authorize the commencement of the appeal or suit 
on the claim as otherwise provided in this chapter. However, in 
the event an appeal or suit is so commenced in the absence of a 
prior decision by the contracting officer, the tribunal 
concerned may, at its option, stay the proceedings to obtain a 
decision on the claim by the contracting officer.
  (6) The contracting officer shall have no obligation to 
render a final decision on any claim of more than $100,000 that 
is not certified in accordance with paragraph (1) if, within 60 
days after receipt of the claim, the contracting officer 
notifies the contractor in writing of the reasons why any 
attempted certification was found to be defective. A defect in 
the certification of a claim shall not deprive a court or an 
agency board of contract appeals of jurisdiction over that 
claim. Prior to the entry of a final judgment by a court or a 
decision by an agency board of contract appeals, the court or 
agency board shall require a defective certification to be 
corrected.
  (7) The certification required by paragraph (1) may be 
executed by any person duly authorized to bind the contractor 
with respect to the claim.
  (d) Alternative Means of Dispute Resolution.--Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this chapter, a contractor and a 
contracting officer may use any alternative means of dispute 
resolution under subchapter IV of chapter 5 of Title 5, or 
other mutually agreeable procedures, for resolving claims. In a 
case in which such alternative means of dispute resolution or 
other mutually agreeable procedures are used, the contractor 
shall certify that the claim is made in good faith, that the 
supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of his or 
her knowledge and belief, and that the amount requested 
accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the 
contractor believes the Government is liable. All provisions of 
subchapter IV of chapter 5 of Title 5 shall apply to such 
alternative means of dispute resolution.
  (e) Cessation of Authority in Dispute Resolution; Procedures 
Regarding Small Business Contractors.--The authority of 
agencies to engage in alternative means of dispute resolution 
proceedings under subsection (d) of this section shall cease to 
be effective on October 1, 1999, except that such authority 
shall continue in effect with respect to then pending dispute 
resolution proceedings which, in the judgment of the agencies 
that are parties to such proceedings, require such 
continuation, until such proceedings terminate. In any case in 
which the contracting officer rejects a contractor's request 
for alternative dispute resolution proceedings, the contracting 
officer shall provide the contractor with a written 
explanation, citing one or more of the conditions in section 
572(b) of Title 5, or such other specific reasons that 
alternative dispute resolution procedures are inappropriate for 
the resolution of the dispute. In any case in which a 
contractor rejects a request of an agency for alternative 
dispute resolution proceedings, the contractor shall inform the 
agency in writing of the contractor's specific reasons for 
rejecting the request.

SEC. 611. INTEREST.

  Interest on amounts found due contractors on claims shall be 
paid to the contractor from the date the contracting officer 
receives the claim pursuant to section 605(a) of this title 
from the contractor until payment thereof. The interest 
provided for in this section shall be paid at the rate 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Public 
Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97) for the Renegotiation Board.

        determines to be tier 2 benefits), shall be subject to 
        offset under this section.
  ``(ii) An amount of $9,000 which a debtor may receive under 
Federal benefit programs cited under clause (i) within a 12-
month period shall be exempt from offset under this subsection. 
In applying the $9,000 exemption, the disbursing official 
shall--
          ``(I) reduce the $9,000 exemption amount for the 12-
        month period by the amount of all Federal benefit 
        payments made during such 12-month period which are not 
        subject to offset under this subsection; and
          ``(II) apply a prorated amount of the exemption to 
        each periodic benefit payment to be made to the debtor 
        during the applicable 12-month period.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the amount of a 
periodic benefit payment shall be the amount after any 
reduction or deduction required under the laws authorizing the 
program under which such payment is authorized to be made 
(including any reduction or deduction to recover any 
overpayment under such program).
  ``(B) The Secretary of the Treasury shall exempt from 
administrative offset under this subsection payments under 
means-tested programs when requested by the head of the 
respective agency. The Secretary may exempt other payments from 
administrative offset under this subsection upon the written 
request of the head of a payment certifying agency. A written 
request for exemption of other payments must provide 
justification for the exemption under standards prescribed by 
the Secretary. Such standards shall give due consideration to 
whether administrative offset would tend to interfere 
substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment 
certifying agency's program. The Secretary shall report to the 
Congress annually on exemptions granted under this section.
  ``(C) The provisions of sections 205(b)(1) and 1631(c)(1) of 
the Social Security Act shall not apply to any administrative 
offset executed pursuant to this section against benefits 
authorized by either title II or title XVI of the Social 
Security Act, respectively.
  ``(4) The Secretary of the Treasury may charge a fee 
sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing this 
subsection. The fee may be collected either by the retention of 
a portion of amounts collected pursuant to this subsection, or 
by billing the agency referring or transferring a claim for 
those amounts. Fees charged to the agencies shall be based on 
actual administrative offsets completed. Amounts received by 
the United States as fees under this subsection shall be 
deposited into the account of the Department of the Treasury 
under section 3711(g)(7) of this title, and shall be collected 
and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of that 
section.
  ``(5) The Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the 
Commissioner of Social Security and the Director of the Office 
of Management and Budget, may prescribe such rules, 
regulations, and procedures as the Secretary of the Treasury 
considers necessary to carry out this subsection. The Secretary 
shall consult with the heads of affected agencies in the 
development of such rules, regulations, and procedures.
  ``(6) Any Federal agency that is owed by a person a past due, 
legally enforceable nontax debt that is over 180 days 
delinquent, including nontax debt administered by a third party 
acting as an agent for the Federal Government, shall notify the 
Secretary of the Treasury of all such nontax debts for purposes 
of administrative offset under this subsection.
  ``(7)(A) The disbursing official conducting an administrative 
offset with respect to a payment to a payee shall notify the 
payee in writing of--
          ``(i) the occurrence of the administrative offset to 
        satisfy a past due legally enforceable debt, including 
        a description of the type and amount of the payment 
        otherwise payable to the payee against which the offset 
        was executed;
          ``(ii) the identity of the creditor agency requesting 
        the offset; and
          ``(iii) a contact point within the creditor agency 
        that will handle concerns regarding the offset.
  ``(B) If the payment to be offset is a periodic benefit 
payment, the disbursing official shall take reasonable steps, 
as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide the 
notice to the payee not later than the date on which the payee 
is otherwise scheduled to receive the payment, or as soon as 
practical thereafter, but no later than the date of the 
administrative offset. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, 
the failure of the debtor to receive such notice shall not 
impair the legality of such administrative offset.
  ``(8) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
shall take precedence over requests for administrative offset 
pursuant to other laws.
  ``(d) Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the use 
of any other administrative offset authority existing under 
statute or common law.''.
  (3) Nontax Debt or Claim Defined.--Section 3701 of title 31, 
United States Code, is amended in subsection (a) by adding at 
the end the following new paragraph:
          ``(8) `nontax' means, with respect to any debt or 
        claim, any debt or claim other than a debt or claim 
        under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.''.

        Federal reserve bank shall withhold credit from banks 
        presenting Treasury checks for ultimate charge to the 
        account of the United States Treasury. By presenting 
        Treasury checks for payment a presenting bank is deemed 
        to authorize this offset.
          ``(2) Attempt to collect required.--Prior to 
        directing offset under subsection (a)(1), the Secretary 
        shall first attempt to collect amounts owed in the 
        manner provided by sections 3711 and 3716.''
  (e) Section 3716 of title 31, United States Code, as amended 
by subsection (d)(2) of this section, is further amended by 
adding at the end the following new subsections:

collection upon written certification by the head of a State or 
an executive, judicial, or legislative agency seeking to 
collect the claim that the requirements of subsection (a) of

Treasury established under 552a(u) of title 5 shall review and 
include in reports under paragraph (3)(D) of that section a

        fiscal, economic, and budgetary effect of the proposed 
        rescission or of the reservation; and
          (5) all facts, circumstances, and considerations 
        relating to or bearing upon the proposed rescission or 
        the reservation and the decision to effect the proposed 
        rescission or the reservation, and to the maximum 
        extent practicable, the estimated effect of the 
        proposed rescission or the reservation upon the 
        objects, purposes, and programs for which the budget 
        authority is provided.
    (b) Requirement to Make Available for Obligation.--Any 
amount of budget authority proposed to be rescinded or that is 
to be reserved as set forth in such special message shall be

bill rescinding all or part of the amount proposed to be 
rescinded or that is to be reserved.

    Sec. 1013. (a) Transmittal of Special Message.--Whenever 
the President, the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, the head of any department or agency of the United

        deferred;
          (2) any account, department, or establishment of the 
        Government to which such budget authority is available 
        for obligation, and the specific projects or 
        governmental functions involved;
          (3) the period of time during which the budget

        proposed deferral;
          (5) to the maximum extent practicable, the estimated 
        fiscal, economic, and budgetary effect of the proposed 
        deferral; and
          (6) all facts, circumstances, and considerations 
        relating to or bearing upon the proposed deferral and 
        the decision to effect the proposed deferral, including

        deferral, and to the maximum extent practicable, the 
        estimated effect of the proposed deferral upon the 
        objects, purposes, and programs for which the budget 
        authority is provided.
A special message may include one or more proposed deferrals of 
budget authority. A deferral may not be proposed for any period 
of time extending beyond the end of the fiscal year in which 
the special message proposing the deferral is transmitted to 
the House and the Senate.
    (b) Requirement To Make Available for Obligation.--Any 
amount of budget authority proposed to be deferred, as set 
forth in a special message transmitted under subsection (a), 
shall be made available for obligation if either House of 
Congress passes an impoundment resolution disapproving such 
proposed deferral.
    (c) Exception.--The provisions of this section do not apply 
to any budget authority proposed to be rescinded or that is to 
be reserved as set forth in a special message required to be 
transmitted under section 1012.
                 transmission of messages; publication
    Sec. 1014. (a) Delivery to House and Senate.--Each special 
message transmitted under section 1012 or 1013 shall be 
transmitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate on 
the same day, and shall be delivered to the Clerk of the House 
of Representatives if the House is not in session, and to the 
Secretary of the Senate if the Senate is not in session. Each 
special message so transmitted shall be referred to the 
appropriate committee of the House of Representatives and the 
Senate. Each such message shall be printed as a document of 
each House.
    (b) Delivery to Comptroller General.--A copy of each 
special message transmitted under section 1012 or 1013 shall be 
transmitted to the Comptroller General on the same day it is 
transmitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate. In 
order to assist the Congress in the exercise of its functions 
under sections 1012 and 1013, the Comptroller General shall 
review each such message and inform the House of 
Representatives and the Senate as promptly as practicable with 
respect to--
          (1) in the case of a special message transmitted 
        under section 1012, the facts surrounding the proposed 
        rescission or the reservation of budget authority 
        (including the probable effects thereof); and
          (2) in the case of a special message transmitted 
        under section 1013, (A) the facts surrounding each 
        proposed deferral of budget authority (including the 
        probable effects thereof) and (B) whether or not (or to 
        what extent), in his judgment, such proposed deferral 
        is in accordance with existing statutory authority.
    (c) Transmission of Supplementary Messages.--If any 
information contained in a special message transmitted under 
section 1012 or 1013 is subsequently revised, the President 
shall transmit to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller 
General a supplementary message stating and explaining such 
revision. Any such supplementary message shall be delivered, 
referred, and printed as provided in subsection (a). The 
Comptroller General shall promptly notify the House of 
Representatives and the Senate of any changes in the 
information submitted by him under his subsection (b) which may 
be necessitated by such revision.
    (d) Printing in Federal Register.--Any special message 
transmitted under section 1012 or 1013, and any supplementary 
message transmitted under subsection (c) shall be printed in 
the first issue of the Federal Register published after such 
transmittal.
    (e) Cumulative Reports of Proposed Rescissions, 
Reservations, and Deferrals of Budget Authority.--
          (1) The President shall submit a report to the House 
        of Representatives and the Senate, not later than the 
        10th day of each month during a fiscal year, listing 
        all budget authority for that fiscal year with respect 
        to which, as of the first day of such month--
                  (A) he has transmitted a special message 
                under section 1012 with respect to a proposed 
                rescission or a reservation; and
                  (B) he has transmitted a special message 
                under section 1013 proposing a deferral.
Such report shall also contain, with respect to each such 
proposed rescission or deferral, or each such reservation, the 
information required to be submitted in the special message 
with respect thereto under section 1012 or 1013.
          (2) Each report submitted under paragraph (1) shall 
        be printed in the first issue of the Federal Register 
        published after its submission.
                     reports by comptroller general
    Sec. 1015. (a) Failure To Transmit Special Message.--If the 
Comptroller General finds that the President, the Director of 
the Office of Management and Budget, the head of any department 
or agency of the United States, or any other officer or 
employee of the United States--
          (1) is to establish a reserve or proposes to defer 
        budget authority with respect to which the President is 
        required to transmit a special message under section 
        1012 or 1013; or
          (2) has ordered, permitted, or approved the 
        establishment of such a reserve or a deferral of budget 
        authority;
  and that the President has failed to transmit a special 
message with respect to such reserve or deferral, the 
Comptroller General shall make a report on such reserve or 
deferral and any available information concerning it to both 
Houses of Congress. The provisions of this part shall apply 
with respect to such reserve or deferral in the same manner and 
with the same effect as if such report of the Comptroller 
General were a special message transmitted by the President 
under section 1012 or 1013, and, for purposes of this part, 
such report shall be considered a special message transmitted 
under section 1012 or 1013.
    (b) Incorrect Classification of Special Message.--If the 
President has transmitted a special message to both Houses of 
Congress in accordance with section 1012 or 1013, and the 
Comptroller General believes that the President so transmitted 
the special message in accordance with one of those sections 
when the special message should have been transmitted in 
accordance with the other of those sections, the Comptroller 
General shall make a report to both Houses of the Congress 
setting forth his reasons.
                      suits by comptroller general
    Sec. 1016. If, under section 1012(b) or 1013(b), budget 
authority is required to be made available for obligation and 
such budget authority is not made available for obligation, the 
Comptroller General is hereby expressly empowered through 
attorneys of his own selection, to bring a civil action in the 
United States District Court for the District of Columbia to 
require such budget authority to be made available for 
obligation, and such court is hereby expressly empowered to 
enter in such civil action, against any department, agency, 
officer, or employee of the United States, any decree, 
judgment, or order which may be necessary or appropriate to 
make such budget authority available for obligation. The courts 
shall give precedence to civil actions brought under this 
section, and to appeals and writs from decisions in such 
actions, over all other civil actions, appeals, and writs. No 
civil action shall be brought by the Comptroller General under 
this section until the expiration of 25 calendar days of 
continuous session of the Congress following the date on which 
an explanatory statement by the Comptroller General of the 
circumstances giving rise to the action contemplated has been 
filed with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the 
President of the Senate.
                     procedure in house and senate
    Sec. 1017. (a) Referral.--Any rescission bill introduced 
with respect to a special message or impoundment resolution 
introduced with respect to a proposed deferral of budget 
authority shall be refereed to the appropriate committee of the 
House of Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be.
    (b) Discharge of Committee.--
          (1) If the committee to which a rescission bill or 
        impoundment resolution has been referred has not 
        reported it at the end of 25 calendar days of 
        continuous session of the Congress after its 
        introduction, it is in order to move either to 
        discharge the committee from further consideration of 
        the bill or resolution or to discharge the committee 
        from further consideration of any other rescission bill 
        with respect to the same special message or impoundment 
        resolution with respect to the same proposed deferral, 
        as the case may be, which has been referred to the 
        committee.
          (2) A motion to discharge may be made only by an 
        individual favoring the bill or resolution, may be made 
        only if supported by one-fifth of the Members of the 
        House involved (a quorum being present), and is highly 
        privileged in the House and privileged in the Senate 
        (except that it may not be made after the committee has 
        reported a bill or resolution with respect to the same 
        special message or the same proposed deferral, as the 
        case may be); and debate thereon shall be limited to 
        not more than 1 hour, the time to be divided in the 
        House equally between those favoring and those opposing 
        the bill or resolution, and to be divided in the Senate 
        equally between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
        and the minority leader or their designees. An 
        amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not 
        in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the 
        motion is agreed to or disagreed to.
    (c) Floor Consideration in the House.--
          (1) When the committee of the House of 
        Representatives has reported, or has been discharged 
        from further consideration of, a rescission bill or 
        impoundment resolution, it shall at any time thereafter 
        be in order (even though a previous motion to the same 
        effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the 
        consideration of the bill or resolution. The motion 
        shall be highly privileged and not debatable. An 
        amendment to the motion shall not be in order, nor 
        shall it be in order to move to reconsider the vote by 
        which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to.
          (2) Debate on a rescission bill or impoundment 
        resolution shall be limited to not more than 2 hours, 
        which shall be divided equally between those favoring 
        and those opposing the bill or resolution. A motion 
        further to limit debate shall not be debatable. In the 
        case of an impoundment resolution, no amendment to, or 
        motion to recommit, the resolution shall be in order. 
        It shall not be in order to move to reconsider the vote 
        by which a rescission bill or impoundment resolution is 
        agreed to or disagreed to.
          (3) Motions to postpone, made with respect to the 
        consideration of a rescission bill or impoundment 
        resolution, and motions to proceed to the consideration 
        of other business, shall be decided without debate.
          (4) All appeals from the decisions of the Chair 
        relating to the application of the Rules of the House 
        of Representatives to the procedure relating to any 
        rescission bill or impoundment resolution shall be 
        decided without debate.
          (5) Except to the extent specifically provided in the 
        preceding provisions of this subsection, consideration 
        of any rescission bill or impoundment resolution and 
        amendments thereto (or any conference report thereon) 
        shall be governed by the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives applicable to other bills and 
        resolutions, amendments, and conference reports in 
        similar circumstances.
    (d) Floor Consideration in the Senate.--
          (1) Debate in the Senate on any rescission bill or 
        impoundment resolution, and all amendments thereto (in 
        the case of a rescission bill) and debatable motions 
        and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited 
        to not more than 10 hours. The time shall be equally 
        divided between, and controlled by, the majority leader 
        and the minority leader or their designees.
          (2) Debate in the Senate on any amendment to a 
        rescission bill shall be limited to 2 hours, to be 
        equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover 
        and the manager of the bill. Debate on an amendment to 
        an amendment, to such a bill, and debate on any 
        debatable motion or appeal in connection with such a 
        bill or an impoundment resolution shall be limited to 
        1, hours to be equally divided between, and controlled 
        by, the mover and the manager of the bill or 
        resolution, except that in the event the manager of the 
        bill or resolution is in favor of any such amendment, 
        motion, or appeal, the time in opposition thereto, 
        shall be controlled by the minority leader or his 
        designee. No amendment that is not germane to the 
        provisions of a rescission bill shall be received. Such 
        leaders, or either of them, may, from time to time 
        under their control on the passage of a rescission bill 
        or impoundment resolution, allot additional time to any 
        Senator during the consideration of any amendment, 
        debatable motion, or appeal.
          (3) A motion to further limit debate is not 
        debatable. In the case of a rescission bill, a motion 
        to recommit (except a motion to recommit with 
        instructions to report back within a specified number 
        of days, not to exceed 3, not counting any day on which 
        the Senate is not in session) is not in order. Debate 
        on any such motion to recommit shall be limited to one 
        hour, to be equally divided between, and controlled by, 
        the mover and the manager of the concurrent resolution. 
        In the case of an impoundment resolution, no amendment 
        or motion to recommit is in order.
          (4) The conference report on any rescission bill 
        shall be in order in the Senate at any time after the 
        third day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
        holidays) following the day on which such a conference 
        report is reported and is available to Members of the 
        Senate. A motion to proceed to the consideration of the 
        conference report may be made even though a previous 
        motion to the same effect has been disagree to.
          (5) During the consideration in the Senate of the 
        conference report on any rescission bill, debate shall 
        be limited to 2 hours, to be equally divided between, 
        and controlled by, the majority leader and minority 
        leader or their designees. Debate on any debatable 
        motion or appeal related to the conference report shall 
        be limited to 30 minutes, to be equally divided 
        between, and controlled by, the mover and the manager 
        of the conference report.
          (6) Should the conference report be defeated, debate 
        on any request for a new conference and the appointment 
        of conferees shall be limited to one hour, to be 
        equally divided between, and controlled by, the manager 
        of the conference report and the minority leader or his 
        designee, and should any motion be made to instruct the 
        conferees before the conferees are named, debate on 
        such motion shall be limited to 30 minutes, to be 
        equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover 
        and the manager of the conference report. Debate on any 
        amendment to any such instructions shall be limited to 
        20 minutes, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the mover and the manager of the 
        conference report. In all cases when the manager of the 
        conference report is in favor of any motion, appeal, or 
        amendment, the time in opposition shall be under the 
        control of the minority leader or his designee.
          (7) In any case in which there are amendments in 
        disagreement, time on each amendment shall be limited 
        to 30 minutes, to be equally divided between, and 
        controlled by, the manager of the conference report and 
        the minority leader or his designee. No amendment that 
        is not germane to the provisions of such amendments 
        shall be received.

the United States of America in Congress assembled,
    Section 1. This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Managers'

    Sec. 2. Section 113 of the Accounting and Auditing Act of 
1950 (31 U.S.C. 66a) is amended by adding at the end thereof 
the following new subsection:
    ``(d)(1)(A) To ensure compliance with the requirements of 
subsection (a)(3) of this section, internal accounting and 
administrative controls of each executive agency shall be 
established in accordance with standards prescribed by the 
Comptroller General, and shall provide reasonable assurances 
that--
          ``(i) obligations and costs are in compliance with 
        applicable law;
          ``(ii) funds, property, and other assets are 
        safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or 
        misappropriation; and
          ``(iii) revenues and expenditures applicable to 
        agency operations are properly recorded and accounted 
        for to permit the preparation of accounts and reliable 
        financial and statistical reports and to maintain 
        accountability over the assets.
                  ``(B) The standards prescribed by the 
                Comptroller General under this paragraph shall 
                include standards to ensure the prompt 
                resolution of all audit findings.
                          ``(2) By December 31, 1982, the 
                        Director of the Office of Management 
                        and Budget, in consultation with the 
                        Comptroller General, shall establish

                        shall not prevent the United States or 
                        an officer or agency thereof from 
                        collecting any claim of the United

    ``Sec. 5. (a) The head of an agency or his designee may, 
after attempting to collect a claim from a Person under section 
3(a) of this Act, collect the claim by means of administrative 
offset, except that no claim under this Act that has been 
outstanding for more than ten years may be collected by means 
of administrative offset.
    ``(b) The head of an agency or his designee may not collect 
any claim by administrative offset authorized by subsection (a) 
unless the agency head has prescribed regulations for the 
exercise of such administrative offset, (31 U.S.C. 954) based 
on the best interests of the United States, the likelihood of 
collecting a claim by administrative offset, and, with respect 
to the collection of claims by means of administrative offset 
after the six-year period provided in section 2415 of title 28, 
United States Code, has expired for bringing an action on such 
a claim, the cost effectiveness of leaving such claim 
unresolved for more than six years.

case in which a statute either explicitly provides for or 
prohibits the collection through administrative offset of the 
claim or type of claim involved.
    ``(e) For purposes of this section--
          ``(1) the term `administrative offset' means the 
        withholding of money payable by the United States to or 
        held by the United States on behalf of a person to 
        satisfy a debt owed the United States by that person;

    Sec. 11. Section 3 of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 
1966 (31 U.S.C. 952) (as amended by section 3 of this Act) is 
further amended by adding at the end thereof the following new 
subsection:
          ``(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), the 
        head of an agency or his designee shall charge a 
        minimum annual rate of interest on outstanding debts on 
        claims owed by persons that is equal to the average 
        investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts 
        for the twelve-month period ending on September 30 of 
        each year, rounded to the nearest whole per centum. The 
        Secretary of the Treasury or his designee shall publish 
        such rate each year not later than October 31 and such 
        rate shall become effective on the first day of the 
        next calendar quarter. The Secretary of the Treasury 
        may revise such rate quarterly if the average 
        investment rate for the twelve-month period ending at 
        the close of that calendar quarter, rounded to the 
        nearest whole per centum, is greater or less than the 
        existing published rate by 2 per centum. For purposes 
        of this paragraph, `calendar quarter' means any three 
        month period beginning on January 1, April 1, July 1, 
        or October 1.

                6 per centum per annum, for failure to pay any 
                portion of a debt more than ninety days past 
                due.
          ``(3) Interest and charges under paragraphs (1) and 
        (2) shall not apply if an applicable statute, a 
        regulation required by statute, a loan agreement, or a 
        contract either prohibit the charging of interest or 
        charges, or explicitly fix interest or charges that 
        apply to claims involved. The head of an agency or his 
        designee may promulgate regulations identifying 
        circumstances appropriate to waive collection of 
        interest and charges in conformity with such standards 
        as may be promulgated jointly by the Attorney General 
        and the Comptroller General. Waivers in accordance with 
        such regulations shall constitute compliance with the 
        requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).

                such notification is first mailed after such 
                date of enactment.
  The rate of interest to be charged on a claim under paragraph 
(1) shall be the rate in effect on the date from which interest 
accrues on the claim under subparagraph (A) or (B), and shall 
remain fixed at that rate for the duration of the indebtedness.

Budget, (31 U.S.C. 955) in consultation with the Secretary of

        necessary in order to determine whether the agency is 
        engaging in aggressive action to collect the claims of 
        the agency.
    (b) The Director shall analyze the reports received by each 
agency under subsection (a) and shall report annually to the 
Congress on the management of agency debt collection 
activities, including the information provided to the Director

duplication of effort.

                            (104 Stat. 2838)

 AN ACT To amend title 31, United States Code, to improve the general 
 and financial management of the Federal Government by establishing a 
   Chief Financial Officer of the United States within the Office of 
Management and Budget; by establishing a Chief Financial Officer within 
 each executive department and within each major executive agency; and 
    by requiring the development of systems that provide complete, 
        accurate, and timely reporting of financial information.
    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled,

                      TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Chief Financial Officers Act 
of 1990''.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
          (1) General management functions of the Office of 
        Management and Budget need to be significantly enhanced 
        to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
        Federal Government.
          (2) Financial management functions of the Office of 
        Management and Budget need to be significantly enhanced 
        to provide overall direction and leadership in the 
        development of a modern Federal financial management 
        structure and associated systems.
          (3) Billions of dollars are lost each year through 
        fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement among the 
        hundreds of programs in the Federal Government.
          (4) These losses could be significantly decreased by 
        improved management, including improved central 
        coordination of internal controls and financial 
        accounting.
          (5) The Federal Government is in great need of 
        fundamental reform in financial management requirements 
        and practices as financial management systems are 
        obsolete and inefficient, and do not provide complete, 
        consistent, reliable, and timely information.
          (6) Current financial reporting practices of the 
        Federal Government do not accurately disclose the 
        current and probable future cost of operating and 
        investment decisions, including the future need for 
        cash or other resources, do not permit adequate 
        comparison of actual costs among executive agencies, 
        and do not provide the timely information required for 
        efficient management of programs.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:
          (1) Bring more effective general and financial 
        management practices to the Federal Government through 
        statutory provisions which would establish in the 
        Office of Management and Budget a Deputy Director for 
        Management, establish an Office of Federal Financial 
        Management headed by a Controller, and designate a 
        Chief Financial Officer in each executive department 
        and in each major executive agency in the Federal 
        Government.
          (2) Provide for improvement in each agency of the 
        Federal Government, of systems of accounting, financial 
        management, and internal controls to assure the 
        issuance of reliable financial information and to deter 
        fraud, waste, and abuse of Government resources.
          (3) Provide for the production of complete, reliable, 
        timely, and consistent financial information for use by 
        the executive branch of the Government and the Congress 
        in the financing, management, and evaluation of Federal 
        programs.

        Congress after its introduction, such committee shall

        Member of the respective House to move to proceed to 
        the consideration of the resolution. The motion is

        shall not be subject to amendment, or to a motion to 
        postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration 
        of other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by

        motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution 
        is passed or rejected shall not be in order.

        debate on the resolution and a single quorum call at 
        the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance 
        with the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on 
        final passage of the resolution shall occur.
  (D) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
application of the rules of the Senate or the House of 
Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating 
to a resolution described in paragraph (1), shall be decided 
without debate.
  (E) If, prior to the passage by one House of a resolution of 
that House, that House receives a resolution with respect to 
the same designation of executive agencies from the other 
House, then--
                  (i) the procedure in that House shall be the 
                same as if no resolution had been received from 
                the other House; but
                  (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on 
                the resolution of the other House.
          (F) It shall not be in order in either the House of 
        Representatives or the Senate to consider a resolution 
        described in paragraph (1), or to consider any 
        conference report on such a resolution, unless the 
        Director of the Office of Management and Budget submits 
        to the Congress a report under subsection (e).

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
          (1) waste and inefficiency in Federal programs 
        undermine the confidence of the American people in the 
        Government and reduces the Federal Government's ability 
        to address adequately vital public needs;
          (2) Federal managers are seriously disadvantaged in 
        their efforts to improve program efficiency and 
        effectiveness, because of insufficient articulation of 
        program goals and inadequate information on program 
        performance; and
          (3) congressional policymaking, spending decisions 
        and program oversight are seriously handicapped by 
        insufficient attention to program performance and 
        results.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
          (1) improve the confidence of the American people in 
        the capability of the Federal Government, by 
        systematically holding Federal agencies accountable for 
        achieving program results;
          (2) initiate program performance reform with a series 
        of pilot projects in setting program goals, measuring 
        program performance against those goals, and reporting 
        publicly on their progress;
          (3) improve Federal program effectiveness and public 
        accountability by promoting a new focus on results, 
        service quality, and customer satisfaction;
          (4) help Federal managers improve service delivery, 
        by requiring that they plan for meeting program 
        objectives and by providing them with information about 
        program results and service quality;
          (5) improve congressional decisionmaking by providing 
        more objective information on achieving statutory 
        objectives, and on the relative effectiveness and 
        efficiency of Federal programs and spending; and
          (6) improve internal management of the Federal 
        Government.

designate the agencies.

guidelines established by the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, such common administrative support 
services to the agency and to other agencies as the head of 
such agency, with the concurrence of the Director, determines 
can be provided more efficiently through such a fund than by 
other means. To provide such services, each such fund is

funds on a competitive basis.

accounts for the purposes to be carried out by the fund, the 
head of the agency may transfer such balances to the fund.

the agency at a level to cover the total estimated costs of 
providing such services. Such fees shall be deposited in the 
agency's fund to remain available until expended, and may be

program performance results of the pilot programs, including

        implementation of franchise funds to other Federal 
        agencies.
    (e) Procurement.--Nothing in this section shall be

procurement laws.
    (f) Termination.--The provisions of this section shall 
expire on October 1, 1999.

                               APPENDIX I

                          A BRIEF EXPLANATION

                                 OF THE

                           UNITED STATES CODE

======================================================================

      
                         The United States Code

    The United States Code (Code or U.S.C.) is divided into 50 
major parts, called titles, by subject matter. The names of the 
50 titles appear at the end of this appendix. Each title is 
subdivided into several categories and the most commonly used 
categories are chapters and sections. The chapters in each 
title are identified by subject matter and sequential numbers. 
However, the numbers in the series may be omitted. Each 
sequential section within a chapter contains the chapter number 
followed by the sequential number of the section.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ For example, Title 31, ``Money and Finance,'' Chapter 35, 
``Accounting and Collection,'' section 3511, ``Prescribing Accounting 
Requirements and Developing Accounting Systems'' is generally referred 
to or cited as ``31 U.S.C. 3511.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
             sections of the code contained in this report
    This report consists primarily of selected provisions from 
Title 31, ``Money and Finance,'' since this title contains most 
of the laws related to financial management. The provisions 
cover, among other subjects, the roles and responsibilities of 
governmental agencies involved in financial management 
(including agency Chief Financial Officers); the congressional 
fiscal and budget process; appropriations and appropriation 
accounting; the public debt; depositing, keeping and paying 
money; accounting and collection; claims process; prompt 
payment; and requirements for the single audit.
    This report also includes selected sections from eight 
other titles of the Code in addition to Title 31. Selected 
provisions of these other titles provide further requirements 
of congressional budget and fiscal operations and governmental 
functions and processes relating to financial management. The 
codified laws included in this report were taken from the Code 
as of December 31, 1995. These eight titles are:
          Title 1, ``General Provisions,''
          Title 2, ``The Congress,''
          Title 5, ``Government Organization and Employees,''
          Title 15, ``Commerce and Trade,''
          Title 39, ``Postal Service,''
          Title 40, ``Public Buildings, Property and Works,''
          Title 41, ``Public Contracts,'' and
          Title 44, ``Public Printing and Documents.''
                      acts included in this report
    This report also includes the recently enacted, but not yet 
codified, Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 and the 
Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, because of their direct 
relationship to financial management. Further, 11 major laws 
dealing with financial management, although included in the 
provisions of the Code in this report, also appear as 
originally enacted to provide users a historical perspective.
                        statutes and public laws
    Officially enacted laws are bound in volumes (referred to 
as ``Statutes at Large'') in chronological order of enactment. 
When citing a particular law, the volume number followed by the 
designation of ``Stat.'' (statute), followed by the page number 
of the volume is used. For example, the Chief Financial 
Officers Act of 1990, would be cited as ``104 Stat. 2838,'' 
meaning the 104th volume of the statutes at large, page 2,838.
    Beginning in 1957, laws have been assigned Public law 
numbers. The public law number contains two numbers separated 
by a dash. The first number indicates the Congress and the 
second number indicates the law number. For example, the Chief 
Financial Officers Act of 1990, is Public Law 101-576; the 
first number indicating the 101st Congress and the second the 
law number.
    Prior to 1957, statute citations usually included a chapter 
number. For example, the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, is 
cited as ``Chapter 18, 42 Stat. 20.''

                              APPENDIX II

                          A BRIEF EXPLANATION

                                 OF THE

                      CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

======================================================================

      
                    The Code of Federal Regulations

    The Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) is a codification 
of the general and permanent rules issued mostly by executive 
departments and agencies of the federal government. The C.F.R., 
published by the Director of the Federal Register, is a special 
edition of the Federal Register containing a compilation of 
federal regulations.
    The C.F.R. is divided into 50 parts called titles (48 
active, two reserved). The titles are listed on the following 
page. They represent broad areas subject to federal 
regulation.\18\ Each title is divided into chapters which 
usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is 
further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory 
areas. The parts are numbered sequentially throughout the 
title.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ Although the C.F.R. contains 50 titles, as does the Code, it 
is organized differently from the Code. Consequently, requirements 
related to a specific subject matter covered in one section of the Code 
may appear in several titles of the C.F.R.
    \19\ The C.F.R. citation contains the number of the title followed 
by the abbreviation ``C.F.R.,'' followed by the part number; such as 31 
C.F.R. 333.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The C.F.R. and the individual issues of the Federal 
Register (after the latest revision of the C.F.R.) provide the 
latest version of any given rule. Each title of the C.F.R., 
which is contained in one or two separate volumes, is revised 
at least once each calendar year.
    The C.F.R. citations in this report are taken from the 
``C.F.R. Index and Finding Aids,'' revised as of January 1, 
1995. The C.F.R. citations, where applicable, appear at the end 
of each chapter of the United States Code included in this 
report, with the section of the Code listed sequentially 
followed by the applicable C.F.R. citation(s). Of the 48 active 
titles of the C.F.R., 42 titles are cited in this report.

                                 OF THE

                       GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE

======================================================================

      
                     The General Accounting Office

    The General Accounting Office (GAO) was established by the 
Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 (31 U.S.C. 702) to 
independently audit Government agencies. The Office is under 
the control and direction of the Comptroller General of the 
United States who is appointed by the President with the advice 
and consent of the Senate for a term of 15 years. GAO is an 
investigative arm of the Congress and is charged with examining 
all matters relating to the receipt and disbursement of public 
funds. GAO's primary role is to ensure that the Congress has 
available for its use current, accurate, and complete financial 
management data. GAO also prescribes accounting principles and 
standards for the executive branch; advises other federal 
agencies on fiscal and related policies and procedures; and 
prescribes standards for auditing and evaluating Government 
programs.
    This appendix is divided into two parts. The first contains 
a description of GAO's issuances and the second contains a 
cross-index listing of the sections of the Code in sequential 
order followed by the related GAO issuance.
                        Description of Issuances

government assistance received by contractors, nonprofit 
organizations, and other nongovernment organizations. These 
standards, often referred to as generally accepted government 
auditing standards (GAGAS), are to be followed by auditors and 
audit organizations when required by law, regulation, 
agreement, or policy. The standards pertain to auditors' 
professional qualifications, the quality of the audit effort, 
and the characteristics of professional and meaningful audit 
reports.

                                 OF THE

                    OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET

======================================================================

      
                  THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), formerly the 
Bureau of the Budget, was established in the Executive Office 
of the President pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1939 
(5 U.S.C. app.). The Office is headed by the Director, who is 
appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. OMB 
evaluates, formulates, and coordinates management procedures 
and program objectives within and among federal departments and 
agencies. The Office's primary fiscal responsibilities include: 
assisting the President in preparing the Budget and formulating 
the federal government's fiscal program; supervising the 
control of the budgetary administration of the Executive 
Branch; and establishing and overseeing the implementation of 
financial management policies and requirements for the federal 
government.
    This appendix is divided into two parts. The first contains 
a description of the OMB's issuances pertaining to financial 
management requirements and the second contains a listing of 
the Code's section with the related OMB issuance.
                        DESCRIPTION OF ISSUANCES
    The primary issuances of OMB related to financial 
management requirements are its Circulars and Bulletins.
    Circulars, identified by the letter ``A'' and containing a 
sequential number in the order of issuance, are used when the 
nature of the subject matter is of continuing use. Between 1952 
and December 31, 1995, OMB issued 135 Circulars. Of the 135, 98 
have been superseded or rescinded, leaving 37 still applicable. 
Of the 37, 18 pertain to the financial management requirements 
relating to the sections of the Code contained in this report. 
The applicable 18 are listed below.

                               APPENDIX V

                     FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ISSUANCES

                                 OF THE

                         DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY

======================================================================

      
                     THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY
    The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) was created by an 
act of September 2, 1789 (31 U.S.C. 301 and 301 note). Many 
subsequent acts have figured in the development of Treasury, 
delegating new duties to its charge and establishing the 
numerous bureaus and divisions that now comprise the Treasury. 
Headed by the Secretary, the Treasury performs four basic 
functions: formulating and recommending economic, financial, 
tax, and fiscal policies; serving as the financial agent for 
the U.S. Government; enforcing the law; and manufacturing coins 
and currency. Its fiscal responsibilities also include managing 
the public debt by improving cash management, debt collection, 
and credit administration on a government wide basis.
    This appendix is divided into two parts. The first contains 
a description of Treasury's issuances pertaining to financial 
management requirements and the second contains a cross-index 
listing of the section of the Code in sequential order followed 
by the related Treasury issuance.
                        description of issuances
    The primary issuance of the Treasury related to financial 
management requirements is the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM). 
The TFM contains six volumes, with only Volume 1 having parts 
applicable to the sections of the Code included in this report. 
Volume 1 includes instructions for financial accounting and 
reporting of all receipts and disbursements of the federal 
government. The volume is divided into six parts, each part 
containing several chapters. The applicable parts and chapters 
of Volume 1 follow.

                    THE FEDERAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

                             ADVISORY BOARD

======================================================================

      
              Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board

                      Referenced to 31 U.S.C. 3511
    The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) was 
established in 1990 by the Secretary of the Treasury, the 
Director of the OMB, and the Comptroller General (principals) 
through a Memorandum of Understanding. The nine-member FASAB 
was created to consider and recommend to the principals for 
approval accounting principles and standards for the federal 
government. Approved recommendations only become effective as 
standards when published by OMB and GAO.
    As of December 31, 1995, the FASAB issued the following 
concept statements and accounting standards which have been 
approved.
    Approved Concept Statements:
          #1.  ``Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting,'' 
        September 1993.
          #2.  ``Entity and Display,'' June 1995.
    Approved Accounting Standards:
          #1.  ``Accounting for Selected Assets and 
        Liabilities,'' March 1993.
          #2.  ``Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan 
        Guarantees,'' August 1993.
          #3.  ``Accounting for Inventory and Related 
        Property,'' October 1993.
          #4.  ``Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and 
        Standards,'' July 1995.
          #5.  ``Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal 
        Government,'' December 1995.
          #6.  ``Accounting for Property, Plant, and 
        Equipment,'' October 1995.
    The FASAB also issued two exposure drafts for comment as of 
December 31, 1995, as follows.
          ``Accounting for Revenue and Other Financing 
        Sources,'' July 1995.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ This standard was approved in May 1996, but has not yet been 
issued.

                          THE COST ACCOUNTING

                            STANDARDS BOARD

======================================================================

      
                    Cost Accounting Standards Board

                      Referenced to 41 U.S.C. 422
    The Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB) was established 
as an independent board within the OMB's Office of Federal 
Procurement Policy. The CASB has exclusive authority to make, 
promulgate, amend, and rescind cost accounting standards and 
interpretations designed to achieve uniformity and consistency 
in cost accounting practices governing measurement, assignment, 
and allocation of costs to contracts and subcontracts with the 
federal government. The Board is a successor to the previous 
CASB which existed from 1970 to 1980. The CASB standards and 
requirements are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations 
(48 C.F.R. 9901 and 9903-9905).
    Although the CASB standards and requirements primarily 
pertain to government contractors, they may be referred to as 
authoritative guidance by federal agencies in specific subject 
areas (for example, determining which specific costs are part 
of pension costs) not covered by standards applicable to 
agencies.

    For additional information, contact the Cost Accounting 
Standards Board, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Office 
of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3254.

                       POPULAR NAMES OF SELECTED

                        MAJOR LAWS CROSS-INDEXED

                           TO SECTIONS OF THE

                         UNITED STATES CODE AND

                         STATUTE OR PUBLIC LAW

======================================================================

      
 Popular Names of Selected Major Laws Cross-Indexed to Sections of the 
              United States Code and Statute or Public Law

    The popular names of selected major laws related to federal 
financial management that appear below are cross-indexed to (1) 
sections of the Code contained in this report and (2) a statute 
citation or public law number. The Code indexed is the U.S.C.A. 
as of December 31, 1995. The statute or public law citations 
relate only to the listed law and do not include subsequent 
amendments.
    As explained in appendix I, public law numbers do not exist 
for laws enacted prior to 1957. Therefore, the statute citation 
is provided for laws enacted prior to 1957 and public law 
numbers are provided for laws enacted after 1956. Also, some 
public laws contain more than one act as identified by popular 
name. Consequently, the same public law number may appear for 
more than one popular named law. When this occurs, the part or 
title of the public law will be provided. For example, both the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974 are contained in PL 93-344. The Congressional 
Budget Act is in titles I-IX and will be indexed as ``PL 93-344 
(Titles I-IX),'' whereas, the Impoundment Control Act will be 
indexed as ``PL 93-344 (Title X).''

                               APPENDIX X

 SELECTED LAWS RELATING TO FEDERAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT BY STATUTE OR 
               PUBLIC LAW NUMBER INDEXED TO POPULAR NAME

======================================================================

      
 Selected Laws Relating to Federal Financial Management by Statute or 
               Public Law Number Indexed to Popular Name

    The list below shows the statute citation or Public Law 
number of selected laws related to federal financial 
management. Subsequent amendments are not shown and users 
should refer to other sources for subsequent amendments. As 
explained in appendix I, Public Law numbers were not used 
before 1957, and consequently, the statute citation is provided 
for those earlier laws. Following the statute list are the 
Public Law numbers, in numeric sequence for quick reference, 
cross-indexed to the popular name.
    Some public laws contain more than one act as identified by 
popular name. Consequently, the same public law number may 
appear for more than one law. When this occurs, the part or 
title of the public law will be provided. For example, both the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974 are contained in PL 93-344. The Congressional 
Budget Act is in titles I-IX and will be indexed as ``PL 93-344 
(Titles I-IX),'' whereas, the Impoundment Control Act will be 
indexed as ``PL 93-344 (Title X).''
