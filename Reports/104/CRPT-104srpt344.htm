               I. Background and Need for the Legislation

    In an effort to respond to concerns about a shortage of 
community-based social services for older persons and a desire 
by policy makers to improve the status of older Americans, 
Congress passed legislation known as the Older Americans Act 
(OAA) in 1965. In doing so, it created a Federal program 
specifically designed to meet the social services needs of 
older persons. Prior to the passage of the act in 1965, older 
persons were eligible for social services available through 
Federal programs; however, recognizing that older persons were 
becoming an increasingly large proportion of the population and 
that their needs were often not being formally addressed 
through existing programs, the act was put in place.
    The original legislation established authority for grants 
to be made to States for community planning and social 
services, research and development projects, and personnel 
training in the field of aging. The law also established the 
Administration on Aging (AOA) within the then- Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) to administer this new 
grant programs and to serve as the Federal focal point on 
matters concerning older persons.
    Although older persons may receive services under many 
other Federal programs, the act is considered to be a major 
vehicle for the organization and delivery of social, nutrition, 
and other services to the population in the United States aged 
60 and over. The act authorizes and provides funding for an 
array of service programs through a nationwide network of 57 
State agencies on aging and 660 area agencies on aging. It also 
supports a community service employment program for low-income 
workers aged 55 and over, the long-term care ombudsman program, 
research, training, and demonstration activities in the field 
of aging, and grants to Native American organizations for 
social and nutrition programs.
    The act has been reauthorized or amended 13 times since the 
original legislation was enacted. The first amendments to the 
act in 1967 extended authorization for the State grant program 
and for research, demonstration, and training programs created 
in 1965. In 1969, Congress added authority for a program of 
area-wide model projects to test new and varied approaches to 
meet the social service needs of the elderly and required 
States to assume statewide responsibility for planning, 
coordination and evaluation of programs for older persons. The 
1969 amendments also authorized the foster grandparent and 
retired senior volunteer programs to provide part-time 
volunteer opportunities for the elderly. (Subsequent 
legislation authorized these programs as part of the Domestic 
Volunteer Service Act of 1973.)
    Major amendments to the act occurred in 1972 with the 
creation of the national nutrition program for the elderly, and 
in 1973, with the establishment of substate area agencies on 
aging. The 1973 amendments represented a major change because, 
for the first time, Federal law authorized the creation of 
local agencies whose purpose is to plan and coordinate services 
for older persons and to act as advocates for programs on their 
behalf. These amendments also created legislative authority for 
the community service employment program for older Americans 
which had previously operated as a demonstration initiative 
under the Economic Opportunity Act. In 1975, Congress extended 
the Older Americans Act through 1978 and specified certain 
services to receive priority under the State and area agency on 
aging program.
    The 1978 amendments represented a major structural change 
to the act when the separate grant programs for social 
services, nutrition services, and multipurpose senior center 
facilities were consolidated into one program under the 
authority of State and area agencies on aging. The intent of 
these amendments was to improve coordination among the various 
service programs under the act. Among other changes were 
requirements that States establish long-term care ombudsman 
programs whose purpose is to investigate and resolve complaints 
of residents of nursing facilities and board and care homes. 
This legislation also created a new title VI authorizing grants 
to Indian tribal organizations for social and nutrition 
services to older Indians.
    The 1981 amendments made no major changes in the act, but 
made modifications intended to give State and area agencies on 
aging more flexibility in the administration of their service 
programs. These amendments also emphasized the transition of 
participants to private sector employment under the community 
service employment program. In 1984, Congress enacted a number 
of provisions, including: new responsibilities for the AOA; 
giving States more flexibility regarding service funds 
allocation under the State grant program; and giving priority 
to the needs of Alzheimer's victims and their families.
    The 1987 amendments expanded some service components of the 
State and area agency program to address the special needs of 
certain populations. Congress authorized a number of distinct 
programs, including the long-term care ombudsman program. Among 
other changes were provisions designed to give special 
attention to the needs of older Native Americans and the 
disabled; emphasize targeting of services to those most in 
need; elevate the status of the AOA within the Department of 
Health and Human Services (DHHS); and liberalize eligibility of 
community service employment participants for other Federal 
programs.
    Amendments in 1992 restructured several of the act's 
programs. The long-term care ombudsman program and elder abuse 
prevention activities were consolidated into an additional 
title, along with a program designed to provide outreach, 
counseling, and assistance to older persons regarding public 
and private benefit programs. In addition, provisions were 
included to strengthen requirements related to targeting of 
title III services on special population groups. Other 
amendments clarified the role of title III agencies in working 
with the for-profit sector and required improvements in AOA 
data collection.
    The Older Americans Act has expanded from a program that 
authorized small grants to States for service programs to a 
nationwide network of State and area agencies that are 
responsible for administration of multiple and complex service 
programs in addition to planning, advocacy, and coordination of 
policies and programs that affect the older population. During 
the late 1960s and early 1970s, much effort was spent on 
establishing the infrastructure of aging programs. During the 
course of various amendments, Congress has made changes 
designed not only to clarify the mission of the program and to 
provide greater flexibility in its administration, but also to 
sharpen responsibilities of State and area agencies in certain 
areas, such as targeting of services to special groups of older 
persons. Other amendments have extended State and area 
agencies' scope of operations to many specific areas, including 
prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, 
coordination of community-based long-term care services, and 
disease prevention and health promotion activities.
    Although the program's funding does not represent a 
significant proportion of the total Federal budget devoted to 
the elderly, a number of aspects of the program contribute to 
its importance to older persons. Over the last three decades, a 
fair level of effort has been devoted to drawing in non-Older 
Americans Act resources to support aging service activities. 
Because emphasis has been placed on coordinating and planning 
services for older persons, and on requiring State and area 
agencies on aging to attract other resources for aging services 
programs, the act has even more potential to improve services 
beyond those funded under its auspices.
    The service programs supported by the act are among the 
most visible programs for older persons within every community 
in the United States. In fiscal year 1994, the national 
nutrition program, the largest component of the act, provided 
240 million meals to over 3 million older persons. About 53 
percent of meals were provided in congregate settings and the 
balance were delivered to frail older persons in their homes. 
Preliminary results from an AOA-sponsored national evaluation 
of the nutrition program, required by the 1992 amendments, has 
pointed to the success of the nutrition program in generating 
State, local, and voluntary contributions. The evaluation found 
that for every $1 in Federal resources, the nutrition program 
leverages nearly $2 in public and private contributions. The 
nutrition program was found to have a positive impact on the 
diets of participants. Meals consumed by both congregate and 
home-delivered meals participants were the primary source of 
nutrients consumed for the day.
    The supportive services program funds a wide variety of 
social services programs. It is a primary source of funds for 
information and referral, outreach, senior center and 
transportation services. In fiscal year 1994, nearly 6.9 
million older persons received supportive services. This 
program also serves as the major source of Federal funds for 
the long-term care ombudsman program.

             II. Legislative History and Votes in Committee

    S. 1643, the ``Older Americans Act Amendments of 1996,'' 
was introduced by Senator Gregg with Senator Kassebaum on March 
26, 1996. Prior to the drafting of the legislation, the 
Subcommittee on Aging of the Committee on Labor and Human 
Resources held two hearings.

                                hearings

    The first hearing was held on March 21, 1995, and was 
entitled ``Bringing Nutrition Programs into the 21st Century.'' 
In an effort to learn more about the day-to-day workings of the 
OAA nutrition programs, the subcommittee heard testimony from 
Herb Stupp, commissioner, New York City Department for the 
Aging, New York, NY; Toby Felcher, special assistant to the 
executive director of CARE, Baltimore, MD; Debra Perou-Hermans, 
executive director, Rockingham Nutrition and Meals on Wheels 
Program, Brentwood, NH; Margot Clark, executive director, North 
West Indiana Meals on Wheels, Crown Point, IN; and Barbara 
Harris, associate director, Senior Citizen Services, Inc., Fort 
Worth, TX. Testimony focused on the need for significantly 
increased flexibility in the use of funds under the act, 
especially the nutrition program dollars. Eliminating the 
artificial division between congregate and home-delivered meals 
program funds, and expanding the authority to impose cost-
sharing requirements were the two themes most emphasized.
    The second hearing was held on June 29, 1995, and was 
entitled ``Maximizing Resources in the Face of Growing 
Demands.'' The subcommittee heard testimony from Julie Govert-
Walter, executive director, North Central-Flint Hills Area 
Agency on Aging, Manhattan, KS; Cheryll Schramm, director, 
Atlanta Regional Commission, Aging Services Division, Atlanta, 
GA; Neetu Dhawan-Gray, director, Baltimore Commission on Aging, 
Baltimore, MD; J. Douglas Mickle, director of advertising and 
marketing services, Reynolds Metals, Richmond, VA; and Jim 
Dunn, director of customer programs and planning, Consumers 
Power Company, Jackson, MI. Removing barriers that stand in the 
way of public/private partnerships in meeting the needs of our 
seniors received significant emphasis. These providers and 
persons involved in independent efforts to eliminate such 
obstacles shared with us the successes of their endeavors. The 
subcommittee believed it was critical to find ways to allow 
Americans to direct their own futures, by supporting and 
promoting such partnerships.
    These hearings provided the basis for the underlying 
principles included in this legislation, having focused on how 
quality services can best be provided to our older population 
and how public/private partnerships can be leveraged to promote 
this important safety net protecting our senior citizens' 
independence. The subcommittee also followed closely the 
hearing process before the House Committee on Economic and 
Educational Opportunities, in an effort to gain as broad a 
perspective as possible.

  Committee Action on the Senior Community Service Employment Program 
                                (SCSEP)

    Under current law, the Department of Labor awards SCSEP 
funds to 10 national program sponsors as well as to State 
agencies for subsidized employment/community service programs 
for older workers. Eligibility restrictions require 
participants to be 55 years old or older, and low-income (at 
125 percent of the poverty level) with ``poor employment 
prospects.'' Preference is given to persons over 60 years of 
age. The majority of the funds (78 percent) goes to the 
entitled organizations, and only 22 percent to the State-run 
programs. Funds are not awarded on a competitive basis and new 
contractors are not afforded an opportunity to apply for the 
funds and offer innovative programs to meet the challenges 
SCSEP is designed to address.
    The SCSEP was included in S. 143, the work force 
development legislation reported out of the Committee on Labor 
and Human Resources on June 21, 1995. S. 143 maintained the 
SCSEP until July 1, 1998, when all individual job training 
programs would have been repealed and consolidated. The bill 
continued to define eligible older workers as individuals over 
55 years of age and low-income. The accountability section 
required States to develop goals for their system and then 
establish special benchmarks for meeting progress toward those 
goals for five specific populations, including older workers. 
The Federal governing board would negotiate with the States, 
with an incentive structure for meeting--and exceeding--the 
benchmarks. It was expected by the committee members supporting 
this change to the program that States would be highly 
motivated to serve their older-worker population well, contrary 
to concerns that this new system would diminish current efforts 
to assist older workers. Under the bill, States are required to 
show exactly how many older workers are being placed in 
meaningful jobs through the statewide system. If they fail to 
meet their benchmarks, States will face monetary sanctions.
    On June 21, 1995, Senator Mikulski offered an amendment in 
committee to strip this provision from S. 143. This amendment 
failed by a vote of 7-9. While all agreed that this program 
does meet important community needs, Republican members of the 
committee believed that States would continue to address these 
needs in the context of a streamlined work force development 
system. In light of the efforts that the 104th Congress is 
making to reduce the Federal deficit, it was believed that it 
is critical that such funds be consolidated to maintain a 
system that will be able to address employment and income 
supplementation needs of seniors.
    S. 143 was incorporated into S. 1120, the Work Opportunity 
Act, which was offered as a substitute to H.R. 4, the Family 
Self-Sufficiency Act. On September 13, 1995, Senator Mikulski 
offered an amendment to H.R. 4 on the Senate floor to remove 
the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) from 
title VII, the job training consolidation provisions. This 
amendment passed by a vote of 55-45, repealing the 
consolidation of the SCSEP with other federally subsidized 
employment programs.

                Improvements to the Older Americans Act

    After these hearings were held and the action on SCSEP 
ensured it was once again within the jurisdiction of the act, 
legislation was drafted and circulated to all committee members 
in December 1995. The subcommittee, at the beginning of the 
104th Congress, had clearly stated that it would focus on 
issues relating to the health and quality of life of senior 
citizens and that sound economic principles would be an 
important theme. The subcommittee, very aware of the 
demographic challenges seniors' programs face in the near 
future, decided all legislative proposals would have to extend 
what has often been short-sighted vision to consider not only 
the problems that confront our seniors today but those facing 
the next generations of older Americans. These themes were 
incorporated into each aspect of the reauthorization draft.
    That draft contained provisions that simplified the OAA, 
restructuring the act into four titles from seven, based on the 
authority administering each component of the act rather than 
the individual programs within the act. The bill contained a 
Federal title, a State title, a title for local programs, and a 
Native American title. This eliminated a number of burdensome, 
bureaucratic requirements that had been introduced into the act 
over the years, while preserving the best qualities and the 
essential structure of the aging network that is supported by 
Federal funds.
    Within the nutrition and supportive services grants program 
in titles II and III (title III of current law) the legislation 
consolidated six separately authorized funding streams into 
two, and increased the transfer authority to up to 25 percent 
between the accounts and provided waiver authority for an 
additional 25 percent transfer. The goal of these provisions 
was to maximize limited funding by increasing the flexibility 
of these programs, allowing those providing services to meet 
the needs that exist from community to community. This was 
directly in response to concerns voiced by service providers 
and program administrators at the local and area agency levels. 
The artificial funding barrier set up between congregate and 
home-delivered meals was removed; States will receive a single 
grant which will be used to appropriately fund both programs. 
The interstate funding formula was also improved, essentially 
replacing the 1987 ``hold harmless'' provisions with a formula 
based on current 60+ population figures, phased in over 5 
years.
    Other important activities funded under the act, including 
the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman program, legal assistance 
services, outreach and counseling, and elder abuse prevention 
program authority were continued, but moved to title II of OAA, 
the State title (currently these activities are in title VII of 
the act.) A specific funding stream was maintained for the 
ombudsman program, recognizing the importance of this program. 
The funding and authority for research and demonstration grants 
were retained in title I of S. 1643 (title IV of current law). 
However, the purpose of these grants was clarified to 
facilitate innovative ways to deliver the broader range of 
services provided for in the act.
    Funding authorization levels in the draft bill were based 
upon the amounts in the Senate Committee on Appropriations-
passed fiscal year 1996 Labor/Health and Human Services 
appropriations bill.

                  Modifications Made to the Draft Bill

    A number of additions were then made to this draft bill 
pursuant to discussions with both Republicans and Democrats on 
the committee, as well as the Administration and numerous 
providers who are part of the aging network. Changes made to 
the draft included adding: authority for the Assistant 
Secretary to continue operating a nationwide toll-free 
telephone line providing information on community elder care 
resources; language permitting States to waive, for 
organizations that have historically provided case management 
and other direct services, the prohibition against providing 
both, with safeguards included to minimize conflicts of 
interests; and a separate line item to fund the ombudsman 
program, with language clarifying that States can reserve 
additional funds from the appropriations for supportive 
services to operate their ombudsman program; and more 
prescriptive provisions related to the ombudsman program were 
reinstated, establishing requirements as to how programs are to 
be organized and operated in States and how to avoid conflicts 
of interest.
    A requirement was added to ensure that the aging network 
provide older individuals with information about health 
insurance and public benefit options available to them 
(including those available through Federal and State programs). 
In addition, other provisions added include: a separate line 
item to fund research and demonstration projects under the act; 
a requirement that States establish and publish procedures for 
changing the designation of an area agency on aging; emphasis 
on the importance of information and assistance services; 
assurance that confidentiality of individual information 
related to cost sharing will be maintained and clarification 
that no older individual can be denied services due to an 
inability to pay; specific targeting of services to minority 
populations; and a separate grant program for disease 
prevention and health promotion.
    Authority was retained for the Assistant Secretary to 
operate a National Center on Elder Abuse. A requirement was 
added for State plans to specify, with respect to legal 
assistance, that a specific percentage of the amount allotted 
for supportive services to each area agency on aging be 
expended for the delivery of legal assistance. A requirement 
was also added providing that whenever a State chooses to 
provide services for the prevention of elder abuse, neglect, 
and exploitation, the State plan must specify a specific 
percentage of the amount allotted for supportive services that 
will be expended for the program.
    The definition of low-income was clarified to mean an 
individual who is a member of a family that has income not more 
than 150 percent of the Federal poverty line (excluding the 
economic eligibility requirement for the SCSEP program, which 
is set at 125 percent of the Federal poverty line); specific 
authority was added to permit the Assistant Secretary to 
evaluate the impact of all programs under the act; and disaster 
relief provisions were added to authorize the Assistant 
Secretary to set aside an amount equal to .06 percent of the 
total amount appropriated for supportive and nutrition services 
to provide grants to States and Indian tribes during major 
disasters declared by the President--funds not distributed by 
the end of the fiscal year will be distributed to the States 
under the formula.
    Also, States must consider the geographical distribution of 
older individuals, the incidence of the need for services, the 
distribution of older individuals who have the greatest 
economic or social need, the distribution of resources 
available to provide such services, the boundaries of existing 
areas within the State, and any other relevant factors when 
dividing the State into planning and service areas. Whenever a 
federally recognized Indian reservation is denied designation 
as a planning and service area, the Indian tribe may appeal the 
decision of the State to the Assistant Secretary who may order 
the State to designate the Indian reservation as a planning and 
service area. More detailed State reporting requirements were 
incorporated.
    In response to concerns raised about potential restrictions 
on the appropriation of funds, all authorizing levels were 
changed to ``such sums.''

                      Introduction of Legislation

    The OAA reauthorization bill was introduced on March 26, 
1996 by Senator Gregg and Senator Kassebaum. The introduced 
legislation included the draft provisions as amended by the 
changes listed above. The bill, S. 1643, may be cited as the 
``Older Americans Act Amendments of 1996.''

                            Committee Action

    The committee completed action on this over the course of 
two executive sessions held on May 1 and 8, 1996. Seven 
amendments were considered during the consideration of S. 1643, 
with three amendments being adopted, and the legislation as 
amended was favorably reported by a roll call vote of 9 yeas to 
7 nays.

A. Amendment modified and accepted during the executive sessions

    One amendment was modified and accepted during the 
executive sessions:
    1. Senator Simon offered an amendment to restore a number 
of references to giving priority for services to minority 
populations. The amendment was modified and accepted. The 
provisions included expand the application of the definition of 
``greatest social need'' which specifically incorporates 
``cultural, social, or geographical isolation, including 
isolation caused by racial or ethnic status'' and ``greatest 
economic need'' which is defined as ``need resulting from an 
income level at or below the poverty line.''

B. Rollcall votes taken during the executive sessions

    Six amendments were offered and rollcall votes were taken. 
Two of these amendments passed and were adopted.
    1. At the May 1 executive session, Senator Mikulski offered 
an amendment regarding the Senior Community Service and 
Employment Program (SCSEP). Under the amendment, 75 percent of 
SCSEP funds in 1997 (decreasing to 65 percent by 1999 through 
2001) would continue to be provided by the Federal Government 
directly to national organizations. National organizations to 
receive funds would be selected through a competitive process; 
national organizations having ``demonstrated effectiveness in 
providing community service employment'' would be granted 50 
percent of the points on any rating scale employed in the 
competitive process. States could carry out SCSEP projects with 
funds remaining. The amendment would require that 75 percent of 
program funds be used for wages and fringe benefits, with a 13 
percent cap on administrative costs. The Assistant Secretary 
could waive the administrative cap in ``appropriate cases;'' no 
criteria for what constitutes ``appropriate cases'' are 
specified. States would have to limit the number of agreements 
that they enter into, but the amendment would not limit the 
number of national organizations that could operate in a State. 
The amendment would also provide for the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services to issue performance standards for States 
and national organizations and impose related reporting 
requirements and penalties. The amendment failed by a roll call 
vote of 7 yeas to 9 nays.

                                    Faircloth

    2. On May 1, Senator Ashcroft offered an amendment which 
would clarify that States may create voucher systems or 
contract with charitable and religious organizations to deliver 
program services. The amendment would allow religious 
organizations providing services to maintain their religious 
character while ensuring that beneficiaries are not 
discriminated against in the delivery of program services and 
must be allowed to receive services from a nonreligious 
provider if they desire. This amendment passed by a roll call 
vote of 8 yeas, 7 nays, and one present vote.

    3. On May 1, Senator Wellstone offered an amendment that 
would mandate that States expend a minimum of 95 percent of the 
amount they spent on legal assistance services in the past. The 
amendment failed by a roll call vote of 7 yeas and 9 nays.

    4. On May 1, Senator Wellstone, on behalf of Senator 
Kennedy, offered an amendment that would make elder abuse 
programs a State-planning mandate and that States must expend a 
minimum of 95 percent of the amount they spent on elder abuse 
prevention services in the past. The amendment failed by a roll 
call vote of 7 yeas and 9 nays.

    5. At the May 8 executive session, Senator Coats offered an 
amendment to the supportive and nutrition services funding 
formula. The amendment gives weight to various age cohorts, a 
measure found to indicate the portion of the ``elderly in-

relative total taxable resources compared to their relative 
EIN. The amendment passed by a vote of 12 yeas and 4 nays.

        III. Explanation of the Legislation and Committee Views

    The Older Americans Act provides funding to the network of 
State and local agencies and providers which advocate, 
coordinate, and deliver services to our rapidly aging 
population. The act is based on the concept of partnership 
between the providers and participants, providers and the local 
community, and local communities and the State. This 
reauthorization strives to build upon the foundation of the 
legislation and improve the programs so that they will move 
forward into the 21st century.

                            NATIONAL PURPOSE

    The purpose of this act is to support and promote the 
efforts of older Americans to live independently in their own 
homes and as part of their local communities. The bill intends 
that public funding and private contributions should expand 
programs incorporated in the act including supportive services 
and enhancing nutrition programs. The core objectives of this 
legislation focus on the goals of self-care by older persons, 
eliminating social and economic barriers, encouraging a range 
of care options, and supporting seniors' ability to support 
themselves financially through employment opportunities.

         RESTRUCTURING THE ACT WHILE PRESERVING CORE FUNCTIONS

    The committee bill has restructured the act according to 
the key components of the network on aging in four titles: 
Title I, core objectives of the act and responsibilities of the 
Administration on Aging (AOA); Title II, functions and 
responsibilities of State programs on aging; Title III, 
functions and responsibilities of local programs on aging; and 
Title IV, functions and responsibilities of Native American 
programs on aging. Current law contains 20 separate 
authorizations of appropriations. S. 1643 reduces these to nine 
separate authorizations of appropriations. The committee 
believes that reducing the number of programs will simplify 
State and area agency on aging operations and will eliminate 
unnecessary administrative burdens. In addition, the bill 
reduces Federal requirements for State and area agencies on 
aging in order to provide these agencies with maximum 
flexibility and to be responsive to the concerns about 
increased responsibilities in recent years without 
corresponding increases in funding.
    At the same time, however, the committee has recognized 
that it is critical to retain as part of the act the core 
functions of State and area agencies on aging. Therefore, the 
bill preserves the functions of State and area agencies, making 
them responsible for the planning of, coordination of, and 
advocacy for programs and services for older persons. These 
functions have been essential responsibilities of the aging 
network since its creation, and the committee intends that the 
network continue to focus on these activities. The bill 
continues to require that State agencies on aging be 
responsible for planning, policy development, coordination, 
priority setting, and evaluation of activities related to the 
act's authorized programs. In addition, the bill requires that 
both State and area agencies serve as effective and visible 
advocates for older persons by reviewing and commenting on 
policies that affect them at the State and community levels.

                   coordination of program resources

    As noted, the committee intends that the aging network will 
continue to emphasize its traditional role of coordination of 
resources on behalf of older persons while expanding efforts to 
work closely and in cooperation with other adult services in 
the State, such as the title XX social services block grant 
program, protection and advocacy activities for persons with 
disabilities, and adult protective services program. Increased 
coordination with programs such as Medicaid can only benefit 
our seniors. The State planning process provides assurances 
that the State will make demonstrable efforts to continue its 
role in coordination of services. This is especially critical 
in this era of dwindling resources.
    The committee recognizes the importance of the development 
of a coordinated public transportation system to maximize the 
efficient and effective mobility of older persons and others 
most in need of assistance. It is the committee's understanding 
that outreach and coordination efforts have begun between 
certain transportation providers which serve the disabled and 
aging communities. The committee encourages these efforts to 
continue and expand and encourages States to become involved in 
such efforts through communication with Metropolitan Planning 
Organizations (MPOs) and other transportation planning entities 
within each State.

               nutrition and supportive service programs

    The committee recognizes that malnutrition in our elderly 
population is a national problem and understands the importance 
of the nutrition and supportive services authorized under the 
act. A paper issued by the American Academy of Family 
Physicians, the American Dietetic Association, and the National 
Council on the Aging, Inc., points out that: ``Older Americans, 
due to many environmental, social, economic and physical 
changes of aging, are at disproportionate risk of poor 
nutrition that can adversely affect their health and 
vitality.'' The project goes on to note that, ``Nutrition-
related health problems cause considerable dysfunction and 
disability, decreased quality of life, and in many cases, 
increased morbidity and mortality. Malnourished older Americans 
get more infections and diseases; their injuries take longer to 
heal; surgery on them is riskier; and their hospital stays are 
longer and more expensive.''
    The committee has retained separate authorizations of 
appropriations for the supportive and nutrition services 
programs, but has added various provisions that give maximum 
flexibility to States and area agencies on aging in the 
operation of these programs. First, the committee has increased 
the authority of States to transfer funds between supportive 
and nutrition services. Under the bill, States are allowed to 
transfer up to 25 percent of their separately allotted funds 
for supportive and nutrition services between these two 
allotments. If a State can justify the need for additional 
transfer authority, it may request a waiver from the Assistant 
Secretary for Aging to transfer an additional 25 percent of 
funds between these allotments. In addition, the bill allows a 
State to delegate this transfer authority to area agencies on 
aging.
    The committee has also eliminated separate authorizations 
of appropriations for the congregate and home-delivered 
nutrition programs. Recent trends in the nutrition services 
program indicate that funding for the two separate programs 
have become very closely aligned. The committee notes that home 
delivered meals now represent almost half of all meals served. 
In fiscal year 1980, home-delivered meals represented only 22 
percent of all meals served; in fiscal year 1994, they 
represented 45 percent of all meals served. The increase has 
occurred as a result of increased funding for the home-
delivered nutrition program as well as State efforts to meet 
the needs of the frail elderly living in their own homes. In 
addition, the committee notes that States frequently transfer 
funds from the congregate nutrition program to the home-
delivered program. In fiscal year 1995, for example, 47 States 
transferred funds in this way. In view of these factors, the 
committee believes that there is no longer any need to have an 
artificial barrier between these programs. However, the bill 
does require States and area agencies on aging to assure that, 
in determining the need for nutrition services, they give 
appropriate consideration to the need for both congregate and 
home-delivered nutrition services.
    Current law also authorizes an appropriation for a 
complementary nutrition assistance program administered by the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Resources appropriated 
to this program are distributed to States under a prescribed 
per meal reimbursement rate either in the form of cash or 
commodities. Most States opt for cash reimbursement; in fiscal 
year 1995, close to 97 percent of the funds appropriated were 
distributed in the form of cash. While the committee is 
supportive of the transfer of the administration of the USDA 
program to AOA, as suggested by the Administration, the 
committee wants an assurance from the appropriators that the 
program will continue to be funded. Until this assurance is 
obtained, however, the committee will not change the Federal 
administration of the program.
    In other efforts to provide more flexibility to States and 
to reduce the number of programs, the committee has 
consolidated funding authorities that are now contained in the 
title VII provisions of the act into an expanded supportive 
services program. Separate authorizations of appropriations for 
outreach, counseling, and assistance for insurance and public 
benefits and for legal assistance are consolidated into the 
supportive services program. At the same time, the bill 
continues to require that States provide emphasis to these 
services. The bill requires State agencies to assure that each 
area agency expend a specific percentage of its supportive 
services and centers funds, as determined by the State, for 
legal assistance. Similarly, State agencies are required to 
assure that each area agency carry out a program for outreach, 
counseling, and assistance for older persons to obtain 
insurance and public benefits, and the area agency must expend 
a specific percentage of its supportive services and centers 
funds, as determined by the State, for these services.
    The committee has retained the current law requirement 
allowing States the discretion to fund programs for the 
prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation under the 
supportive services program. Because a major share of support 
for State adult protective services programs comes from sources 
other than the act, the committee has left to State agencies on 
aging the decision as to whether they will provide for elder 
abuse, neglect, and exploitation programs. However, the bill 
requires that when State agencies choose to use supportive 
services funding for this purpose, they stipulate how much each 
area agency must expend for this service from funds allotted 
for supportive services.

                              COST SHARING

    S. 1643 provides clear authority to States permitting them 
to institute cost-sharing programs on a sliding scale for all 
services delivered under the act except information and 
assistance, outreach, benefits counseling, case management, the 
long-term care ombudsman program, and other protective 
services. The limited voluntary contribution policy in current 
law has proven to be a valuable asset in expanding the dollars 
that are available to serve our older population, allowing 
either more seniors to be served or a greater number of 
services to be offered to those in need.
    However, it must be noted that these cost-sharing 
provisions also state that older individuals may not be denied 
a service because they either are unable or unwilling to 
participate in a cost-sharing arrangement. A specific 
prohibition is included on imposing cost-sharing requirements 
on persons with an income lower than 150 percent of the Federal 
poverty level. The cost-sharing provisions are to be based on 
an individual's self-declaration of income. While the bill 
continues to permit seniors to make voluntary contributions as 
well, this State flexibility will add a new dimension to 
services delivered under the act, especially the nutrition 
programs which function as a vital lifeline to seniors around 
the country. This option for States will allow them to choose 
how they can best reach out and meet the needs of all those 
older persons who require this assistance, whether it be for 
social, physical, or economic reasons.
    Expansion of cost sharing has long been encouraged by many 
States as well as local level providers. Not only will these 
provisions encourage more contributions, which then can be 
parlayed into more services, but this authority will permit 
States to further coordinate programs at the State level that 
have such requirements. A 1989 GAO report (In-Home Services for 
the Elderly, Cost Sharing Expands Range of Services Provided 
and Population Served) found that 36 States had mandatory cost 
sharing for a variety of aging-related social services. This 
report recommended that the act be amended to specifically 
authorize mandatory cost sharing for in-home services, with 
certain exceptions.
    In 1990, the Inspector General of Health and Human Services 
released a report (Cost Sharing for Older Americans) stating 
that 40 States had mandatory and/or voluntary cost sharing for 
State-supported social service programs and finding that cost 
sharing was widely viewed as a positive factor. A 1991 report 
issued by the House Select Committee on Aging (Cost Sharing for 
the Elderly: A Survey of Current Incidence and Practice) found 
24 States had mandatory cost sharing, most often applied to in-
home services. The greatest advantage to cost sharing that was 
cited was the ability to expand services delivered; the 
greatest negative was the administrative burden associated with 
fee collection.
    Witnesses before the Subcommittee on Aging testified that 
the current environment of growing need and greater 
restrictions on the availability of public funding translates 
into stronger support than ever for expanded cost-sharing 
authority. These individuals have the opportunity on a daily 
basis to see how such funds supplement the limited program 
dollars, how more seniors can be served, and how making a 
contribution toward the cost of the service means more of our 
older Americans can maintain their pride and dignity while 
receiving the help they may need. The committee wants to 
emphasize that it recognizes that the individuals who need the 
assistance of services provided under this act do not always 
need the help because of personal financial pressures. This is 
not a ``welfare'' bill in the economic sense. This act is 
designed to contribute to the welfare--the well-being--of our 
aging population.

                 STATE LONG-TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM

    In view of the important role that the State Long-Term Care 
Ombudsman Program plays on behalf of the frail elderly in long-
term care facilities and as part of the aging network, the 
committee has retained a separate authorization of 
appropriations for this program under subtitle B of title II. 
The committee intends that partial funding to support the 
program continue to be appropriated under this separate 
authorization. However, because the committee recognizes that 
most of the act's funding for ombudsman services comes from the 
supportive services and centers program, the bill also 
authorizes services provided through the State long-term care 
ombudsman program under the title III supportive services 
program. The committee does not intend that the separate 
authorization of appropriations under subtitle B will in any 
way limit State decisions to fund this program from funds made 
available under the supportive services program.
    The bill retains the current law requirement that in order 
to be eligible for funds, a State must establish and operate an 
Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman and that it be 
headed by an Ombudsman who will serve on a full-time basis. In 
addition, the committee has retained key components of the 
program that are part of current law. These include 
requirements that long-term care facility residents have 
regular and timely access to ombudsman services and that they 
receive timely responses to complaints. It also requires that 
the State ensure that program representatives have access to 
facilities, residents, and resident medical and social records 
(with consent of the resident or his or her legal 
representative), and licensing and certification records of the 
State, among other documents. The bill also retains current-law 
requirements that the State agency ensure that there is no 
conflict of interest in the designation of the Ombudsman and 
that adequate legal counsel is available to protect the 
Ombudsman in the performance of official duties. The State is 
required to assure that interference with the performance of 
official duties of the Ombudsman is unlawful and to prohibit 
retaliation by long-term care facilities when a complaint is 
filed. In addition, authority for the State Ombudsman to 
designate an entity as a local ombudsman is retained.
    The committee would like to emphasize that coordination of 
ombudsman services needs to be recognized as an important 
component of this program. State Ombudsmen should coordinate 
their efforts with those of other State agencies, such as State 
licensing and certification agencies that assess nursing 
facilities and health care personnel, as well as State Medicaid 
offices, to avoid duplication of investigatory duties. The 
committee hopes that this will also lead to a sharing of 
expertise, especially in light of the large volunteer force 
employed by the ombudsman program. The committee also hopes 
that the Ombudsmen will strive to maintain the quality and 
integrity of this program in their services as advocates in 
matters which may adversely affect the well-being of seniors 
residing in long-term care facilities.

                   RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION GRANTS

    In an effort to preserve the aspects of this program that 
are producing the best innovations on ways to effectively 
deliver services under the act, the committee retained a 
separate line item for research and demonstration grants. This 
line item was not funded by the appropriators in fiscal year 
1996, and the committee understands the need to maximize 
resources and make reasonable reductions in Federal spending. 
The committee hopes that appropriate funding will be restored 
to this important program; the legislation ensures that the 
funds will be spent on projects designed to bolster the 
services identified as appropriate by this act.

              SENIOR COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM

    As it is the intent of the committee to institute the 
reform of the Senior Community Service Employment Program 
(SCSEP) in program year 1996, which began July 1, 1996, and the 
rest of the reauthorization reforms at the beginning of fiscal 
year 1997, which begins October 1, 1996, the first section of 
S. 1643 should be read as an amendment to title V of current 
law. The systemic reform of the OAA through its reauthorization 
begins with title I of this legislation. (The SCSEP reform 
provisions will be discussed in detail later in this report.)
    We agree wholeheartedly with the intent behind programs 
such as SCSEP to serve the employment and training needs of 
older workers. Older workers have a strong voice at the State 
and local levels in ensuring that their needs are met, and we 
expect that governors and local elected officials will be 
responsive to those needs. In addition, we believe that by 
giving States the flexibility they are seeking for reform, and 
by eliminating Federal overhead, more resources will be 
available to States for serving older workers. However, the 
committee also concurs with the GAO that it is critical that 
program administration be streamlined and that these funds be 
directed into services that will more effectively address the 
needs of seniors.
    Under the committee bill, the SCSEP program remains a 
distinct component of the act, with a specific authorization of 
appropriations. The Federal administration of the program is 
moved from the Department of Labor (DOL) to the AOA. However, 
in the context of the broader coordination of programs under 
the act, a separate title for SCSEP has been eliminated. 
Instead the program is incorporated into the bill's State 
programs. It is the intent of the committee to improve this 
program by allowing it to be run by entities much closer to 
their constituencies than the current Washington-based 
structure headed by DOL. All funds will be distributed directly 
to the States, rather than continuing the practice of giving 
the majority of the funds to 10 select organizations. States 
will then have the authority to competitively award funding to 
a variety of types of organizations, including public or 
private nonprofits, area agencies on aging, tribal 
organizations, or political subdivisions of the States, to run 
the SCSEP services within that State. The State may choose how 
to structure the program to best meet the diversity of needs 
that may exist within their population.
    The issues driving this change to the SCSEP program were 
brought to light by two GAO reports. A February 1994 report 
(Department of Labor: Noncompetitive, Discretionary Grants) 
discussed the use of the DOL Procurement Review Board (PRB), 
which functions as a central review point for all grant awards 
above $25,000. The report also noted that DOL has a requirement 
in the case of sole-source grants that program officials and 
agency heads disclose any relationships they may have with 
potential grant recipients. In their response to the draft 
report in October 1993, DOL itself points out that the SCSEP 
program is exempt from the normal departmental procedures 
applied to all other similar grants.
    Responding to further congressional concern about this 
program, GAO issued a second report in November 1995 
(Department of Labor: Senior Community Service Employment 
Program Delivery Could Be Improved Through Legislative and 
Administrative Actions) that examined SCSEP carefully and made 
a number of recommendations on how the program could be 
improved under the act. This report is the basis for many 
changes in the reauthorization.
    One of the central issues addressed by this bill is the 
spending priorities of grant recipients running employment 
programs for our older workers. Presently, DOL regulations 
require that only 75 percent of these funds be expended on 
enrollee wages and fringe benefits. The act specifically limits 
the use of Federal funds for administering programs at 13.5 
percent; program sponsors are permitted to apply for a waiver 
to spend up to 15 percent. The remaining 10 percent is 
generally spent on other enrollee costs (OEC), which may 
include items such as physical examinations, transportation, 
counseling, the purchase of incidental items necessary for the 
enrollees' participation, and job training costs.
    The committee believes that a greater share of the program 
funds must be returned to the program participants, rather than 
spent by organizations for administrative expenditures. 
Therefore, the bill requires that no more than 10 percent of 
program funds distributed to a State be spent on administration 
(15 percent in small States), directing more funds into wages 
and fringe benefits for those older persons who are working in 
SCSEP jobs. This will expand services to seniors. States like 
Maryland have proven that spending Federal funds on the 
administration of the SCSEP programs is not the way to maximize 
these limited dollars; they spend minimal Federal funds on 
administering their State program, choosing to supplement SCSEP 
funds with State revenue.
    In addition to administrative expenditures, the bill 
addresses the use of Federal funds for OEC. The bill defines 
the items that can be classified as OEC and those that qualify 
as administrative expenses, to end any confusion or ambiguity 
that may exist on the part of current, or new, program 
sponsors. These definitions are based on 1976 final regulations 
issued by the DOL. The bill, again, emphasizes that the 
priority for Federal funds being expended under this program 
must be on wages and fringe benefits; OEC expenses, combined 
with administrative expenditures, may not consume more than 20 
percent of the total SCSEP grant. Waivers, however, may be 
granted to increase the amount expended on OEC by an additional 
5 percent if the State or sponsor running the program 
demonstrated a 30 percent or higher transition rate into 
unsubsidized employment the previous year.
    The committee recognizes that training of senior citizens 
for potential private sector employment is an important 
function of the Senior Community Service Employment Program. 
Furthermore, training and then private sector job placement 
should be viewed as a way to expand opportunities for seniors 
to participate in the SCSEP program. Toward that goal, the 
committee has made a greater percentage of program dollars 
available for training through the waiver for additional OEC 
expenditures in situations where training and private sector 
job placement prove to be the expertise of the SCSEP program 
sponsor.
    The bill also defines a standardized measure for a 
``successful'' transition into an unsubsidized placement by a 
program enrollee. Each of the current 10 national 
organizations, as well as the States, has in the past chosen to 
define this measure differently. DOL issued a directive for the 
1995 program year defining unsubsidized placement, which all 
program sponsors have been asked to follow. This definition has 
been codified in this bill.
    The bill's SCSEP provisions also contain an amendment which 
encourages program sponsors to spend a portion of their funds 
on carrying out agreements with private businesses. This 
provision is modeled on a similar provision in current law. The 
bill permits States to expend up to 5 percent of their total 
distribution on such agreements; these agreements would be 
funded by a 50/50 split between Federal funds and either State 
or private funds. This provides an opportunity for more 
participants to transition into private sector jobs and further 
emphasizes the committee's desire to promote public/private 
partnerships that will support the effort to keep our senior 
citizens independent and self-sufficient.

                        NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS

    The committee has retained a separate title for programs 
for Native Americans because of the unique status of Native 
Americans. The bill has modified the provision in current law 
that sets aside funds for Native Hawaiian organizations in 
efforts to reduce the number of separate programs under the 
act. Grants continue to be made by the Assistant Secretary, but 
under a streamlined administrative process.

                      INTERSTATE FUNDING FORMULAS

    As is often the case with any changes in Federal law 
regarding funding formulas, the interstate funding formulas 
proposed in this legislation have been the subject of a great 
deal of controversy. It has been the intention of the committee 
throughout the process to ensure that the formulas in this bill 
are designed to accomplish several things: to distribute the 
funds in the fairest manner possible, based on actual, rather 
than perceived, need; to incorporate recommendations that have 
been made by respected entities, such as the GAO, following 
careful study of the factors involved; and to include factors 
which guarantee that the distributions are being calculated by 
AOA on the most current data available. The committee 
understands that the lack of funding equity that has occurred 
has been a result of the ``hold harmless'' provisions that have 
been included in the law over the years.

Nutrition and supportive services

    The formula incorporated into the bill by amendment gives 
weight to various age cohorts, a measure found to indicate the 
portion of the ``elderly in-need'' (EIN), and the State revenue 
base, measured by the relative total taxable resources compared 
to their relative EIN. The EIN is calculated by multiplying the 
60+ population by a weight of .65, then giving additional 
weight to older age groups: 70-74 at .03; 75-79 at .08; 80-84 
at .09; and 85+ at .15. The EIN then is compared to a State's 
relative total taxable resources, so that States with a lower 
resource base would receive a higher allotment. The formula 
includes a Federal floor and ceiling, and restrictions on 
annual gains of 3.75 percent or losses of 4 percent. The 
formula retains the small-State minimum requirements. The 
formula is based on recommendations made by the GAO in two 1994 
reports (Older Americans Act: Title III Funds Not Distributed 
According to Statute, Jan. 94, and Older Americans Act: Funding 
Formula Could Better Reflect State Needs, May 94.)

Senior Community Service Employment Program

    The SCSEP formula in the bill is designed to address the 
current inequities that exist in the distribution of funds 
among States due, in a large part, to the 1978 ``hold 
harmless'' that prevents an equitable distribution of funds 
among States on the basis of actual, current levels of need. 
The bill eliminates the 1978 calculation that consistently 
results in some States being overserved and others underserved, 
and bases the distribution of funds solely on each States' 
relative share of the 55+ population and per capita income. The 
formula will be phased in over 5 years, and it retains the 
small-State minimum requirements.

                           AUTHORIZING LEVELS

    The draft bill originally circulated by the committee 
contained annual authorization levels for the first year of the 
reauthorization that were based upon the amounts originally 
approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations for fiscal 
year 1996. In response to concerns expressed by members of the 
committee that the levels were too potentially restrictive on 
the programs of the act, and because of the lack of clarity as 
to what the final appropriations would be due to the numerous 
continuing resolutions that were enacted during the 104th 
Congress, the bill authorizes ``such sums as may be necessary'' 
for the restructured programs.
    It is the committee's understanding that the Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO) must base their cost estimates for the bill 
on historical spending rates coupled with estimations of the 
funds that would be necessary to provide services to the 
eligible and interested population. The committee once again 
emphasizes the expansive nature of the act. Participation is 
not limited to those in economic need; it is designed to 
support all older individuals, whether their needs are economic 
or social. The committee has expanded the ability to accept 
private contributions for services rendered under the act and 
has emphasized throughout its consideration of the 
reauthorization the importance of public/private partnerships 
on all levels of participation. We need to look at the act in 
terms of its total contribution, through both the appropriation 
of Federal funds and the authority to levy private dollars, 
toward meeting the needs that exist. The committee recognizes 
the assumptions made by the CBO and, at the same time, 
acknowledges the fiscal constraints facing the appropriators. 
The committee hopes that the appropriators will give the act 
fair and thoughtful consideration in determining appropriate 
funding levels for these very important programs which support 
our older Americans, especially those designed to meet our 
elders' daily needs in the form of nutrition and supportive 
service programs.

                     IV. Summary of the Legislation

 Amendment to the Older American Community Service Employment Act for 
                            Fiscal Year 1996

    This amendment sets forth requirements for the 
administration of the Older American Community Service 
Employment program for fiscal year 1996. It transfers 
responsibility for Federal administration of the program from 
the Department of Labor (DOL) to the Administration on Aging 
(AOA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). It 
requires the Assistant Secretary of AOA to make grants to State 
and tribal organizations to provide part-time employment 
opportunities in community services to unemployed low-income 
older individuals who have poor employment prospects.
    The amendment sets forth conditions that State and tribal 
organizations must meet to receive funds and requires that no 
less than 90 percent of Federal funds be used for participant 
wages and fringe benefits, except in small States where no less 
than 85 percent of Federal funds be used. It sets a limitation 
on the amount of funds that may be used for administration (no 
more than 10 percent of Federal funds). It requires that State 
or tribal organizations award funds for the operation of the 
program to entities on a competitive basis. It also authorizes 
funds for fiscal year 1996.

Title I--General provisions

    Subtitle A of title I simplifies the purpose of the act and 
sets forth core objectives. It also consolidates definitions 
for all the act's titles.
    Subtitle B of title I establishes AOA in the Office of the 
Secretary of DHHS. It specifies that AOA is to be headed by an 
Assistant Secretary for Aging. It requires the Assistant 
Secretary to designate employees to be responsible for 
administration of various programs under the act and 
streamlines functions of the Assistant Secretary, including 
authority to make grants or award contracts for research, 
training, and demonstration activities. Subtitle B authorizes 
funds for fiscal years 1997-2001 for the administration of the 
act; and the national toll-free telephone line; research, 
training, and demonstration activities; and the National Center 
on Elder Abuse.
    Subtitle C of title I specifies formulas for allotment of 
funds for the State long-term care ombudsman program; the 
Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP); and the 
supportive and nutrition services program. It also authorizes 
funds for the following service programs: State long-term care 
ombudsman; SCSEP; disease prevention and health promotion; 
supportive services and senior centers; and nutrition services. 
It also authorizes additional funds for nutrition services 
under the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and specifies 
that this assistance may be in the form of cash or commodities.

Title II--State programs on aging

    Subtitle A of title II sets forth conditions for States to 
receive funds and State plan requirements. It requires each 
State to develop a State plan to be approved by the Assistant 
Secretary and requires that States designate area agencies on 
aging for each planning and service area in the State. It 
specifies requirements for carrying out various service 
programs, including legal assistance; activities to prevent 
elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation; and outreach, counseling 
and assistance services.
    This subtitle also allows States to establish cost-sharing 
policies for older recipients of services. It sets the Federal 
matching percentage for administration at 85 percent. It also 
sets a limit on how much a State may transfer between its 
allotments for supportive and nutrition services.
    Subtitle B of title II authorizes grants for long-term care 
ombudsman services and requires that a State establish an 
Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman. It sets forth the 
responsibilities of the Office and requires that the Ombudsman 
serve on a full-time basis.
    Subtitle C of title II requires the Assistant Secretary to 
make grants to States and tribal organizations to provide part-
time employment opportunities for unemployed low-income older 
individuals who have poor employment prospects. It sets forth 
conditions that State or tribal organizations must meet to 
receive funds and requires that no less than 90 percent of 
Federal funds be used for participant wages and fringe 
benefits, except in small States where no less than 85 percent 
of Federal funds be used. It sets a limitation on the amount of 
funds that may be used for administration (no more than 10 
percent of Federal funds). It requires that State or tribal 
organizations award funds for the operation of the program to 
entities on a competitive basis. It also transfers 
responsibility for Federal administration of the program from 
DOL to AOA.
    Subtitle D of title II establishes authority for the 
Assistant Secretary to make grants to States for disease 
prevention and health promotion services and sets forth 
requirements for the award of funds within the State.

Title III--Local programs on aging

    Subtitle A of title III sets forth characteristics of 
agencies that may be designated as area agencies and requires 
that an area plan on aging be submitted to the State agency on 
aging. It also sets forth area plan requirements, including 
that the plan provide supportive and nutrition services as part 
of a comprehensive and coordinated service system.
    It allows a State to administer and provide services 
through grants or contracts with charitable, religious or 
private organizations and specifies the conditions under which 
organizations are eligible to receive assistance.
    Subtitle B of title III authorizes the Assistant Secretary 
to make grants for supportive services and defines these 
services. Subtitle C authorizes the Assistant Secretary to make 
grants for nutrition services and consolidates the congregate 
and home-delivered nutrition services programs.

Title IV--Native American programs on aging

    This title authorizes the Assistant Secretary to make 
grants to Indian tribal organizations, Alaska Native 
organizations, and Native Hawaiian organizations. It sets forth 
requirements that these organizations must meet in order to 
receive funds and requirements for grant applications. It 
authorizes funds for this purpose for fiscal years 1997-2001.

                            V. Cost Estimate

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                     Washington, DC, July 24, 1996.
Hon. Nancy Landon Kassebaum,
Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources,
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.
    Dear Madam Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1643, the Older 
Americans Amendments of 1996, as reported by the Committee on 
Labor and Human Resources on May 8, 1996.
    Enactment of S. 1643 would not affect direct spending or 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply 
to the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.
    Enclosure.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: S. 1643.
    2. Bill title: The Older Americans Amendments of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee 
on Labor and Human Resources on May 8, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: The bill would reauthorize programs funded 
under the Older Americans Act of 1965, including federal 
administration, long-term care ombudsman programs, supportive 
services, senior centers, nutrition services, and grants to 
Native Americans. The bill also would transfer authority for 
operating the Community Service for Older Americans program to 
the Administration on Aging in the Department of Health and 
Human Services, and would create a funding stream for disease 
prevention and health promotion services for the elderly.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: S. 1643 would 
authorize such sums as may be necessary for most programs from 
fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2001. The bill also would 
authorize $157 million to be transferred from the Department of 
Agriculture to the Department of Health and Human Services for 
the purpose of subsidizing the cost of nutrition programs. 
Enactment of the bill would not affect direct spending or 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply. 
The estimated budgetary impact of this bill is summarized below 
both with and without adjusting the authorizations of 
appropriations for inflation in years when the amount 
authorized is not specified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    The costs of this bill would fall within budget function 
500.
    6. Basis of estimate: Spending under S. 1643 would be 
subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Estimated 
outlays are based on the historical spending patterns of 
programs authorized under the Old Americans Act of 1965.
    S. 1643 would authorize appropriations for fiscal years 
1997 through 2001 for programs under the Older Americans Act. 
In general, the programs are authorized at such sums as may be 
necessary for fiscal years 1997-2001. When the authorization 
amount is not specified, CBO estimates the amount necessary to 
fund the programs at levels that would allow the eligible and 
interested population to participate. For only one program--the 
meal subsidy program funded by the Department of Agriculture--
S. 1643 would authorize a specific amount for 1997, and such 
sums as may be necessary for 1998 through 2001. Tables 2 and 3 
show the estimated authorizations under two scenarios. Under 
the first scenario, the amount estimated for 1997 is adjusted 
for projected inflation thereafter. Under the second scenario, 
the projected authorization level is assumed to be equal to the 
amount estimated to be necessary for 1997. Estimated outlays 
assume full appropriation of the amounts authorized.

Title I: Administrative expenses

    Title I would authorize an Administration on Aging to carry 
out programs authorized under the Older Americans Act. In 
addition, Title I would authorize a toll-free service for 
seniors to use to locate needed services in their area, a 
Center for Elder Abuse, and grants and contracts for research 
and demonstration projects that involve innovative approaches 
and best practices in services for seniors. CBO estimates that 
authorizations for these programs would remain at currently 
appropriated levels, with the exception of the research and 
demonstration projects. Research and demonstration projects 
received funding of $27 million in fiscal year 1995 and $3 
million in 1996. CBO estimates that $15 million would be 
authorized for fiscal year 1997, based on average 
appropriations in the past two years. Total estimated 
authorizations for Title I are $35 million for fiscal year 
1997, and $192 million for fiscal years 1997-2001.

Title II: State programs

    Title II of the bill would authorize grants to states for 
up to 85 percent of the costs of operating long-term care 
ombudsman, senior community service employment, and disease 
prevention and health promotion programs. CBO estimates 
authorizations for state programs at $835 million for fiscal 
year 1997, and a total of $4.4 billion over fiscal years 1997-
2001. State program funding is detailed below.
    Title II-B would establish state long-term care ombudsman 
programs. CBO assumed that these grants would provide each 
state with funds to support one state ombudsman and minor 
administratives expenses. In addition, CBO estimated the cost 
of providing local ombudsman representatives at the ratio 
currently recommended by the Institute of Medicine (one full 
time ombudsman per 2,000 long term care beds). Estimated 
authorizations of appropriations necessary for this type of 
program are $45 million for fiscal year 1997, and $241 million, 
if inflation is taken into account, over fiscal years 1997-
2001.
    Under Title II-C, the bill would transfer operation of the 
Senior Community Service Employment program from the Department 
of Labor to the Administration on Aging. Additionally, the bill 
would change the way in which funds for the program currently 
are distributed. Under current law, the majority of grants for 
this program are given to non-profit organizations. The bill 
would allocate all of the grants to states, which would make 
grants to other organizations for the purposes of providing 
low-income seniors with paid, part-time community service 
employment opportunities. The bill would define low-income 
seniors as those individuals 55 years and older who have income 
below 125 percent of the poverty rate, with special attention 
to be given to those individuals with poor employment 
prospects. Using 1994 income data and poverty guidelines, CBO 
estimates that about 9 million seniors would be eligible for 
this subsidized employment program. However, only about 3.3 
percent of this eligible population is estimated to have been 
looking for work in that year. If positions were to be made 
available to all seniors who qualify and are seeking 
employment, $1.5 billion annually would be needed. However, 
participation in such programs is always less than the total 
eligible population. If future participants in the Senior 
Community Service Employment program were to exhibit similar 
characteristics to current participants, an estiamted 50 
percent of those eligible would participate. Accordingly, $755 
million would need to be authorized for fiscal year 1997, and 
about $4 billion for fiscal years 1997-2001.
    The bill would provide grants to states for the operation 
of disease prevention and health promotion programs under Title 
II-D. CBO estimates that authorizations of $35 million would be 
needed in fiscal year 1997 for disease prevention programs. In 
deriving this estimate, CBO used the average cost per person of 
providing an annual disease prevention screening as a proxy for 
the per person expense for this subtitle. Participation was 
estimated at 1 percent of seniors, based on current 
participation in health promotion and disease prevention 
programs.

Title III: Local programs

    Title III of the bill would authorize grants for supportive 
services and senior centers, as well as grants to operate 
nutrition programs. CBO estimates a total of $2.2 billion would 
be authorized for local aging programs for fiscal year 1997.
    Title III-B would authorize grants to states for the 
provision of supportive services to be passed through to area 
agencies on aging. Portions of the funds authorized under Title 
III-B could be used for conducting ombudsman programs, and 
could be transferred to nutrition programs at a state's 
discretion. In estimating the amount to be authorized under 
this subtitle, CBO took into account the various types of 
services that could be provided, the average per person cost 
for each service, and historical participation rates, as well 
as potential participation rates as estimated by service 
providers. CBO estimates that $795 million would be authorized 
for fiscal year 1997 under Title III-B.
    Nutrition programs for the elderly are authorized under 
Title III-C. Under current law, nutrition programs are split 
into two categories: congregate meals and home-delivered meals. 
S. 1643 would combine these two programs under one funding 
stream. Currently, about 3 million seniors participate in 
nutrition programs under the Older Americans Act. However, 
surveys of nutrition service providers indicate that the need 
for nutrition programs, particularly for home-delivered meals, 
exceeds the amount provided for at current funding levels. 
Preliminary results of a national evaluation of elder nutrition 
programs show that 9 percent of congregate meal providers and 
41 percent of home delivered meal providers have waiting lists. 
Twenty-two percent of the waiting lists for congregate meals 
and 5 percent of the waiting lists for home-delivered meals 
exceed 100 percent of the average number of daily meals served. 
Because not all service providers maintain waiting lists, and 
because waiting lists do not capture all seniors who may be at 
nutrititional risk or who may wish to participate, these 
results are considered to be a lower-bound indicator for the 
need for nutrition services.
    The state of New York estimates that about 6 percent of 
seniors are in need of home delivered meals because they lack 
the ability or assistance to prepare their own meals. If this 
figure is applied nationally, about 2.5 million seniors would 
require home delivered meal services. However, in 1994, only 
about 877,000 seniors received such services. If additional 
funds were to be made available to provide home-delivered meals 
for 2 million more seniors, and to alleviate the backlog for 
congregate meals, CBO estimates that the 1997 authorization 
would be about $1.3 billion.
    In addition, the bill would authorize $157 million for 
fiscal year 1997 and such sums as necessary for fiscal years 
1998-2001 for the meal subsidy program funded by the Department 
of Agriculture.

Title IV: Native American programs

    Title IV of the bill would authorize grants to eligible 
organizations for the operation of programs that would serve 
Native Americans. If services similar to those authorized for 
non-Native Americans were to be made available for programs 
that would serve Native Americans, the estimated authorization 
of appropriations would be about $40 million for fiscal year 
1997.
    Tables 2 and 3 below show the proposed changes in 
authorization levels by title with and without adjustments for 
inflation.

    7. Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal 
governments: S. 1643 contains no intergovernmental mandates as 
defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 
104-4). The bill would reauthorize and consolidate voluntary 
programs that provide grants to state and tribal governments, 
giving them additional flexibility to allocate these funds. The 
bill would also make a number of changes to the Senior 
Community Service Employment program. First, the bill would 
make states responsible for administering all funds associated 
with the program. Currently, states participating in this 
program administer about 20 percent of all program funds, and 
national organizations such as the National Council of Senior 
Citizens administer the rest. In addition, the bill would 
change the maximum allowance for administrative expenses from 
13.5 percent to 15 percent for small states and 10 percent for 
others. Finally, the federal share of project costs would be 
reduced from 90 percent to 85 percent.
    8. Estimated impact on the private sector: S. 1643 does not 
include any mandates as defined in P.L. 104-4.
    9. Estimate comparison: On April 15, 1996, CBO provided an 
estimate for H.R. 2570, the Older Americans Amendments of 1996. 
While the bills are similar, H.R. 2570 differs from S. 1643 in 
some respects. Notably, the House bill states levels of 
authorizations of appropriations for each program authorized 
under the bill. In addition, the House bill would include 
reauthorization of the Retired Senior Volunteer program, the 
Foster Grandparent program, and the Senior Companion program. 
S. 1643 does not include these programs. Total authorizations 
of appropriations for H.R. 2570 are $1,489 million for fiscal 
year 1997.
    10. Previous CBO estimate: None.
    11. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Christi 
Hawley and Dottie Rosenbaum. State and Local Cost Estimate: 
Marc Nicole. Private Sector Mandate Estimate: Constance Rhind.
    12. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant 
Director, for Budget Analysis.

                    VI. Regulatory Impact Statement

     The committee has determined that there will be a decrease 
in the regulatory and paperwork burden imposed by this bill.

                    VII. Section-by-Section Analysis

    Section 1 (Short Title) specifies the title of the bill as 
the ``Older Americans Act Amendments of 1996.''
    Section 2 (Table of Contents) sets forth the table of 
contents of the bill.
    Section 3 (Amendment to the Older American Community 
Service Employment Act for Fiscal Year 1996) amends the Older 
American Community Service Employment Act (title V of the Older 
Americans Act), as follows.

          Title V--Senior Community Service Employment Program

    Section 501 (Short Title) cites the title as the ``Older 
American Community Service Employment Act.''
    Section 502 (Allotment of Funds for Fiscal Year 1996) 
specifies the formula for allotment of funds for fiscal year 
1996. It requires that, after a reservation of funds for tribal 
organizations, the remaining funds be distributed to States 
based on their relative share of funds allotted for fiscal year 
1995. It further requires the balance of funds to be 
distributed according to States' relative share of the 
population aged 55 and over and State per capita income. It 
also specifies a minimum allotment of one-half of 1 percent for 
States, and a minimum of one-quarter of one percent, or 
$50,000, whichever is greater, for territories. It requires 
that funds not used by a State be reallotted to other States.
    Section 503 (Senior Community Service Employment Program) 
requires the Assistant Secretary to make grants to State and 
tribal organizations to provide part-time employment 
opportunities in community services to unemployed low-income 
older individuals who have poor employment prospects.
    This section requires that not less than 90 percent of 
Federal funds be used for wages and benefits for older 
individuals, and in small States, not less than 85 percent of 
funds. It allows a waiver of this requirement in certain 
circumstances. It places a limitation on administrative costs 
and allows a State or tribal organization to use a portion of 
funds for other participant costs. It also requires that, to 
the maximum extent practicable, a grantee pay administrative 
and other participant costs from non-Federal funds.
    This section sets forth eligibility requirements for grants 
and requires that States and tribal organizations submit 
applications to the Assistant Secretary. The application must 
assure that funds will be used in accordance with title V 
requirements and will not be used to carry out a project for 
the construction, operation, or maintenance of a facility for 
sectarian religious instruction or worship. It requires States 
and tribal organizations to enter into agreements with public 
or nonprofit private agencies or organizations; political 
subdivisions of States; tribal organizations; and area agencies 
on aging.
    It also allows States and tribal organizations to use up to 
5 percent of Federal funds for agreements with businesses.
    It requires States and tribal organizations to award funds 
to eligible entities on a competitive basis, and to take into 
consideration the demonstrated ability of the entity to provide 
employment to eligible individuals. It also sets forth the 
requirements that projects must meet in order to receive funds. 
These include requirements that the project: employ older 
individuals to provide services related to publicly owned and 
operated facilities or public or nonprofit private 
organizations; contribute to the general welfare of the 
community; result in an increase in employment opportunities 
that would not otherwise be available and not result in the 
displacement of currently employed workers; and assess the 
skills of individuals, their needs for supportive services, and 
their ability to perform community service employment, among 
other requirements.
    It sets the Federal share of the cost of the project at no 
more than 85 percent, and requires that the non-Federal share 
be in cash or in-kind.
    It requires that States and tribal organizations, when 
making a determination where projects are most needed, consult 
with area agencies on aging and other organizations that 
received funding in the prior fiscal year. It also requires 
that, to the maximum extent practicable, States and tribal 
organizations ensure that projects provide employment to older 
individuals who were participants on the day before the 
effective date of these amendments (July 1, 1996).
    It also sets forth requirements regarding coordination of 
projects with other programs, equitable use of funds, data 
collection, and Federal rules on transition of participants 
into unsubsidized employment, among other requirements.
    Section 504 (Participants Not Federal Employees) specifies 
that participants are not to be considered Federal employees. 
It prohibits a State or tribal organization from entering into 
an agreement with an entity whose employees are exempt from 
State workmen's compensation that is generally applicable to 
employees unless the entity can assure that individuals will 
have equal coverage.
    Section 505 (Employment Assistance and Federal Housing and 
Food Stamp Programs) prohibits wages received by individuals 
from the program from being considered as income for purposes 
of determining eligibility for Federal housing and the food 
stamp programs.
    Section 506 (Definitions) defines the following terms: 
administrative costs; community services; low-income; older 
individual; other participant costs; placed in unsubsidized 
employment; small State; State; and tribal organization.
    Section 507 (Authorization of Appropriations) authorizes 
for fiscal year 1996 such sums as may be necessary. It also 
defines the program year cycle and allows the Secretary to 
extend a program year for a period of up to 60 days after the 
end of the program year. It also specifies technical and 
conforming amendments.
    Section 4 (Amendment to the Older Americans Act of 1965) 
amends the Older Americans Act of 1965, as follows:
    Section 1 (Short Title) cites this act as the ``Older 
Americans Act of 1965.''
    Section 2 (Table of Contents) sets forth the table of 
contents for the act.

(AOA) which is headed by an Assistant Secretary for Aging. It 
requires that: the act be administered by the Administration, 
acting under the supervision of the Secretary; the Assistant 
Secretary be appointed by the President with the advice and 
consent of the Senate; the Assistant Secretary designate

    This section requires the Assistant Secretary to serve as 
the effective and visible advocate for older individuals within 
DHHS and with other departments and agencies of the Federal 
Government by maintaining active review and comment of Federal 
policies affecting older persons; establish a nationwide toll-
free telephone line; and coordinate with, advise, and consult 
with heads of each departments or agencies of the Federal 
Government that are proposing or administering programs related

agencies to coordinate their activities with the Assistant 
Secretary.
    This section allows the Assistant Secretary to exercise the 
following powers: consult with and provide technical assistance 
to public or nonprofit agencies, organizations, and 
institutions; and provide short-term training and technical 
instruction.
    It also allows the Assistant Secretary to make grants or 
award contracts to State, public or nonprofit private agencies, 
organizations, and institutions, and tribal organizations in 
order to design, test, and promote innovative ideas and best 
practices in programs and services for older individuals, help

Subtitle C--Funding

    Section 121 (Allotments; Federal Share) specifies allotment 
methodologies for ombudsman services, the senior community 
service employment program, and supportive and nutrition 
services.
    For ombudsman services, funds are allotted to States based 
on States' relative share of the population aged 60 and over, 
with a minimum allotment amount of one-half of one percent of 
funds appropriated.
    For the senior community service employment program, after 
reservation of funds for Indian tribal organizations, the 
remaining funds are allotted to States according to their 
relative share of the population aged 55 years and over and 
State per capita income. This section phases out, over a 3-year 
period (fiscal years 1997-1999), the current law distribution. 
It specifies a minimum allotment amount of one-half of one 
percent of the funds appropriated for States and one-quarter of 
one percent for territories.
    For supportive and nutrition services, funds are allotted 
to States based on their relative share of an ``elderly in 
need'' factor (a weighted sum of a State's relative share of 5 
specified population categories of persons aged 60 and over) 
and the relative size of a State's taxable resources compared 
to the elderly in need factor. This section also specifies a 
number of other conditions. These are that: a State allotment 
must be equal to or greater than a minimum share of total 
appropriation; increases or decreases from a prior year's 
allotment are limited; an allotment that is increased due to an 
increase in appropriations from fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 
1997 is guaranteed an increase that is at least equal to the 
overall increase in appropriations in subsequent fiscal years.
    This section specifies that the Federal share for 
supportive and nutrition services will be 85 percent of the 
cost of services, and requires that the non-Federal share be in 
cash or in kind.
    This section also specifies limitations on amounts States 
and area agencies may use for administration of State and area 
plans and for the long-term care ombudsman program. It allows 
additional funds to be used for administration of the State 
plan under certain conditions.
    Section 122 (Authorization of Appropriations) authorizes 
such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1997-2001 for 
the State long-term care ombudsman, SCSEP, disease prevention 
and health promotion, supportive services and senior centers, 
and nutrition services programs. It also specifies that the 
senior community service employment program will operate on a 
July 1-June 30 funding cycle.
    Section 123 (Additional Funds Available for Nutrition 
Services) authorizes $156.6 million for fiscal year 1997 and 
such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1998-2001 for 
the Secretary of Agriculture to provide assistance for 
nutrition services under title III of the act. It also 
specifies that 98.9 percent of assistance will be allotted to 
States, with the balance for programs for Native Americans 
under title IV. It specifies that the Secretary of Agriculture 
shall determine a per-meal rate equal to the amount 
appropriated divided by the number of meals served in the 
preceding year and shall allot to each State an amount equal to 
the per-meal rate. It specifies that a State or area agency may 
elect to receive reimbursement in the form of cash or 
commodities.

   Title II--State Programs on Aging, Subtitle A--General Provisions

    Section 201 (Eligibility of States) sets forth conditions 
for States to receive funds. It requires that the State 
designate a State agency as the sole State agency to: develop 
and administer the State plan; be responsible for the planning, 
policy development, administration, and evaluation of the State 
plan; serve as an effective and visible advocate for older 
individuals; and divide the State into distinct planning and 
service areas. It also requires the State agency to designate 
an area agency on aging for each planning and service area; 
take into account the views of recipients of services; develop 
and publish for review and comment a formula for the 
distribution of supportive and nutrition services; assure that 
the State give preference in providing services to older 
individuals with the greatest economic need and greatest social 
need, with particular attention to low-income, minority older 
individuals.
    It requires the State agency to establish and publish due 
process procedures and ``grandfathers'' in single planning and 
service areas that had been designated on or before October 1, 
1980, among other requirements.
    Section 202 (State Plans) specifies State plan 
requirements. Among other requirements, it requires that the 
State plan: be submitted to the Assistant Secretary on a 2-, 3-
, or 4-year period; be based on area plans; require each area 
agency to submit an area plan to the State agency; establish a 
grievance procedure for area agencies and service providers; 
adopt fiscal control procedures; prohibit individuals involved 
in designation of State or area agencies or officials of these 
agencies from being subject to conflicts of interest; maintain 
the integrity and public purpose of services and providers; 
establish and maintain information and assistance services; 
require each area agency to carry out a program for outreach, 
counseling, and assistance to assist older individuals obtain 
insurance benefits and public benefits and expend a percentage 
of its funds as specified in the State plan for this purpose.
    It also prohibits a State or area agency from directly 
providing supportive services (with the exception of 
information and assistance, case management, and outreach) and 
nutrition services unless certain conditions are met. It 
further requires that the State plan: carry out a State long-
term care ombudsman program; require each area agency to expend 
a percentage of its supportive services funds for legal 
assistance as specified in the State plan; meet certain program 
conditions when the State agency opts to expend funds on a 
program of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation prevention; 
provide outreach to identify specific groups of older 
individuals; coordinate services for individuals with 
disabilities with relevant State agencies; require area 
agencies to coordinate community-based long-term care services 
for older individuals in needs of these services; prohibit 
funds to be used to carry out activities unrelated to the 
purposes of the act; provide multigenerational activities; and 
assure quality of services provided under the act.
    This section further provides that the State may elect to 
require cost sharing by recipients, or require or permit area 
agencies to require cost sharing as long as cost sharing will 
not be required for certain services. These are: information 
and assistance, outreach, benefits counseling, case management, 
or ombudsman or other protective services. It also requires 
that: individuals with income below 150 percent of the poverty 
line be exempted from cost sharing; cost-sharing rates be 
subject to a sliding-fee scale; income be determined by self-
declaration; confidentiality of older individuals is 
maintained; and no older individual be denied a service because 
of inability to pay. This section also allows for voluntary 
contributions.
    This section sets forth procedures for approval or 
disapproval of the State plan, and for appeals by States. It 
also prohibits providers from revealing information protected 
by the attorney-client privilege.
    Section 203 (Planning, Coordination, Evaluation and 
Administration of State Plans) establishes the Federal matching 
share for administration of the State plan at 85 percent and 
defines administrative costs. It also allows States to use 
funds not otherwise used for State administration for area 
agency administration or for services. It allows single 
planning and service areas to elect to pay for administration 
from amounts available for State agency administration or area 
agency administration.
    This section also allows a State to transfer up to 25 
percent of its allotments for supportive and nutrition services 
between such allotments. The Assistant Secretary may grant a 
waiver to allow a State to transfer an additional 25 percent of 
funds. It also allows a State agency to delegate to an area 
agency authority to transfer up to 25 percent of its funds 
between these allotments.
    Section 204 (Payments) allows payments for title II and 
title III services to be made in advance or by reimbursement.

Subtitle B--State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program

    Section 211 (Establishment) requires the Assistant 
Secretary to make grants to States to carry out a long-term 
care ombudsman program. It requires that in order for a State 
to be eligible for a grant it must establish and operate an 
Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman and carry out the 
program through the Office. It also requires that the Office be 
headed by the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman who will be 
selected from among individuals with expertise and experience 
in long-term care and advocacy.
    Section 212 (Requirements for State Long-Term Care 
Ombudsman Program) sets forth the duties of the Office and 
requires that the Ombudsman serve on a full-time basis. The 
Ombudsman is required to, personally or through representatives 
of the Office, identify, investigate and resolve complaints 
that are made by, or on behalf of, residents of long-term care 
facilities and to provide services to assist residents. 
Complaints may relate to action, inaction or decisions by 
providers, public agencies or health and social service 
agencies that may adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, 
or rights of residents.
    This section further specifies the duties of the Ombudsman, 
including: informing residents about means of obtaining 
services; ensuring that residents have regular and timely 
access to services; representing the interests of residents 
before governmental agencies and seeking administrative, legal, 
and other remedies to protect residents; analyzing, commenting 
on and monitoring the development of Federal, State and local 
laws, rules and policies that affect residents; and providing 
for training of representatives of the Office, among other 
responsibilities.
    The section allows the State agency to establish and 
operate the Office directly, or by contract or other 
arrangement with any public or nonprofit private organization, 
agency, or institution. It prohibits the State agency from 
entering into a contract or other arrangement with agencies 
responsible for licensing or certifying long-term care services 
or an association of long-term care facilities or other 
residential facilities.
    It allows the Ombudsman to designate an entity as a local 
ombudsman entity and to designate an individual to represent 
the entity. Entities and individuals eligible to be designated 
are required to have demonstrated capability to carry out 
responsibilities of the Office, be free of conflict of 
interest, be public or nonprofit private entities, and meet 
other requirements determined by the Ombudsman. This section 
also sets forth the authority and responsibilities of the local 
ombudsmen.
    This section requires the State agency to establish 
procedures regarding monitoring the program, confidentiality 
and conflict of interest policies, disclosure of files, and 
other procedures for operation of the program. It also requires 
the State agency to document operations of the program.
    This section requires the State to assure that 
representatives of the Office have access to long-term care 
facilities, residents, and resident records; program 
representatives will not be liable for good faith performance 
of official duties; and willful interference with 
representatives of the Office will be unlawful. It also 
requires the State to prohibit retaliation and reprisals by a 
long-term care facility and to provide for appropriate 
sanctions in such cases.

Subtitle C--Senior Community Service Employment Program

    Section 221 (Short Title) cites the subtitle as the ``Older 
American Community Service Employment Act.''
    Section 222 (Definitions) defines the following terms: 
administrative costs; other participant costs; placed in 
unsubsidized employment; and small State.
    Section 223 (Senior Community Service Employment Program) 
requires the Assistant Secretary to make grants to State and 
tribal organizations to provide part-time employment 
opportunities in community services to unemployed low-income 
older individuals who have poor employment prospects.
    This section requires that not less than 90 percent of 
Federal funds be used for wages and benefits for older 
individuals, and in small States, not less than 85 percent of 
funds. It allows a waiver of this requirement in certain 
circumstances. It also places a limitation on administrative 
costs, and allows a State or tribal organization to use a 
portion of funds for other participant costs. It also requires 
that, to the maximum extent practicable, a grantee pay for 
administrative and other participant costs from non-Federal 
funds. It defines administrative and other participant costs.
    This section sets forth eligibility requirements for grants 
and requires that a State or tribal organization submit an 
annual application to the Assistant Secretary. The application 
must assure that funds will be used in accordance with 
requirements of this subtitle and will not be used to carry out 
a project for the construction, operation, or maintenance of a 
facility for sectarian religious instruction or worship. It 
states that the State or tribal organization is required to 
enter into agreements with public or nonprofit private agencies 
or organizations; political subdivisions of States; tribal 
organizations; and area agencies on aging.
    It also allows a State or tribal organization to use up to 
5 percent of Federal funds for agreements with businesses.
    It requires State or tribal organizations to award funds on 
a competitive basis and take into consideration the 
demonstrated ability of the entity to provide employment to 
eligible individuals. It also sets forth requirements that 
organizations must meet in order to receive funds. These 
include requirements that the project employ older individuals 
to provide services related to publicly owned and operated 
facilities or public or nonprofit private organizations; 
contribute to the general welfare of the community; result in 
an increase in employment opportunities that would otherwise be 
available and not result in the displacement of currently 
employed workers; assess the skills of individuals, their needs 
for supportive services, and their ability to perform community 
service employment, among other requirements.
    It sets the Federal share of the cost of the project at no 
more than 85 percent, and requires that the non-Federal share 
be in cash or in-kind.
    It requires that a State or tribal organization, when 
making a determination where projects are most needed, consult 
with area agencies on aging and other organizations that 
received funding in the prior fiscal year. It also requires 
that, to the maximum extent practicable, a State or tribal 
organization ensure that projects provide employment to older 
individuals who were participants on the day before the 
effective date of section 3 of the bill (the 1996 amendments to 
the senior community service employment program), that is, July 
1, 1996.
    Section 224 (Participants Not Federal Employees) specifies 
that participants are not to be considered Federal employees. 
It also prohibits a State or tribal organization from entering 
into an agreement with an entity whose employees are exempted 
from workmen's compensation that is generally applicable to 
employees, unless the entity can assure that individuals will 
have equal coverage.
    Section 225 (Employment Assistance and Federal Housing and 
Food Stamp Programs) prohibits funds received by individuals 
from the program from being considered as income for purposes 
of determining eligibility for Federal housing and the food 
stamp programs.

Subtitle D--Disease Prevention and Health Promotion

    Section 231 (Establishment of Grant Program) requires the 
Assistant Secretary to make grants to provide disease 
prevention and health promotion services at congregate meal 
sites, through home-delivered meals programs, or at other 
sites. It allows a State to determine the services to be 
provided, except the State may not provide services that would 
be provided through Medicare. It also requires the State agency 
to give priority in awarding funds to areas of the State that 
are medically underserved and where there are large 
concentrations of older individuals with the greatest economic 
need.

   Title III--Local Programs on Aging, Subtitle A--General Provisions

    Section 301 (Eligibility of Local Organizations) sets forth 
the characteristics of agencies that may be designated as area 
agencies on aging and establishes a preference for designation 
to an established office on aging under certain conditions.
    Section 302 (Area Plans) specifies area plan requirements. 
Among other requirements, it requires that the area plan: be 
submitted to the State agency on a 2-, 3-, or 4-year period as 
determined by the State agency; provide, through a 
comprehensive and coordinated system, supportive services and 
nutrition services; determine the extent of need for services; 
evaluate the effectiveness of resources in meeting needs; make 
agreements with providers; promote independent living through 
home and community-based care; address nutrition and health 
promotion needs; provide advocacy and protect the rights of 
vulnerable older individuals; establish and maintain 
information and assistance services; set specific objectives 
for providing services to older individuals with greatest 
economic and social need, and those living in rural areas; use 
outreach to identify older individuals in need of services; 
provide technical assistance to providers; take into account 
the views of recipients; serve as an advocate and focal point 
for older individuals; establish an advisory council; 
facilitate the coordination of community-based long-term care; 
establish a grievance procedure for older individuals who are 
dissatisfied with services; meet certain program conditions 
when the State agency chooses to carry out a program of elder 
abuse, neglect, and exploitation prevention; describe in the 
area plan the assistance it received for supportive and 
nutrition services and assure that such activities conform with 
the act's requirements.
    This section also specifies conditions under which case 
management may be provided by the area agency and that cost-
sharing requirements must be consistent with the State plan.
    This section specifies procedures for withholding of funds 
and due process procedures in such cases.
    Section 303 (Services Provided by Charitable, Religious, or 
Private Organizations) allows a State to administer and provide 
services through grants or contracts with charitable, 
religious, or private organizations. It also specifies the 
purpose of this section, that is, to allow religious 
organizations to receive awards on the same basis as other 
providers without impairing the religious character of such 
organizations, and without diminishing the religious freedom of 
beneficiaries of assistance under the program. It specifies the 
conditions under which such organizations are eligible to 
receive assistance and prohibits discrimination against such 
organizations.
    This section requires that religious organizations retain 
independence from Federal, State and local governments. It 
defines protections for such organizations, and rights of 
beneficiaries who have objections to receiving services from 
such organizations. It also specifies nondiscrimination and 
fiscal accountability requirements, and limitations on use of 
funds.

Subtitle B--Supportive services and senior centers

    Section 311 (Program Authorized) requires the Assistant 
Secretary to make grants to States for supportive services and 
specifies the supportive services that may be provided under 
title III.

Subtitle C--Nutrition services

    Section 321 (Program Authorized) requires the Assistant 
Secretary to make grants to States for nutrition projects that 
will provide at least one meal per day. It sets forth 
requirements that projects must meet, including compliance with 
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and with dietary 
allowances established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the 
Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences.

              Title IV--Native American Programs on Aging

    Section 401 (Grants for Services to Native Americans) 
allows the Assistant Secretary to make grants to Indian tribal 
organizations, Alaska Native organizations, and Native Hawaiian 
organizations that meet requirements of title IV. Organizations 
are eligible to participate if they represent at least 50 older 
individuals and demonstrate the ability to deliver supportive 
and nutrition services.
    Section 402 (Application for Grants) requires that in order 
to be eligible to receive a grant an organization must submit 
an application to the Assistant Secretary. It requires that the 
application assure that the organization will evaluate the need 
for supportive and nutrition services; use efficient methods of 
administration; report on activities to the Assistant 
Secretary; periodically evaluate the project; establish and 
maintain information and assistance services; and coordinate 
services with State and local programs under titles II and III, 
among other requirements. It also allows organizations to 
develop population statistics in order to establish eligibility 
to receive grants.
    This section requires the Assistant Secretary to approve 
any application that complies with title IV requirements and 
sets forth procedures to be followed if an application is not 
approved. The Assistant Secretary is required to approve a 
grant for a period of at least 12 months.
    Section 403 (Distribution of Funds Among Eligible 
Organizations) requires that a grant to an eligible 
organization for fiscal year 1997 or subsequent years not be 
less than the amount awarded to such organization for fiscal 
year 1991. It also sets forth procedures for awards if funds 
appropriated for a given year exceed the fiscal year 1991 
amount.
    Section 404 (Surplus Education Facilities) requires the 
Secretary of the Interior to make surplus Indian or Alaska 
Native educational facilities, or surplus educational 
facilities located in Hawaii available for use as multipurpose 
senior centers. It also requires that in order to be eligible 
for such facilities, organizations must submit an application 
to the Secretary of the Interior.
    Section 405 (Administration) requires the Assistant 
Secretary to consult with the Secretary of the Interior when 
issuing rules to carry out title IV.
    Section 406 (Payments) allows payments under title IV to be 
made in advance or by reimbursement.
    Section 407 (Authorization of Appropriations) authorizes 
such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1997-2001.
    Section 5 (Conforming Amendments) sets forth conforming 
amendments to other legislation.
    Section 6 (References to Preceding Fiscal Year) states that 
any reference to ``the preceding fiscal year'' refers to funds 
received to carry out a program, project, or activity for the 
preceding fiscal year.
    Section 7 (Issuance of Rules) requires the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to publish proposed rules pursuant to 
these amendments not later than 180 days after enactment. It 
also requires that final rules be issued not later than 90 days 
after publication of the proposed rules.
    Section 8 (Application of Amendments) specifies that 
section 3 of the bill (Amendment to the Older American 
Community Service Employment Act for fiscal year 1996), applies 
to fiscal year 1996 and section 4 (Amendment to the Older 
Americans Act of 1965) will not apply prior to fiscal year 
1997.
    Section 9 (Transfer of Functions) transfers functions 
related to administration of title V of the Older Americans Act 
from the Department of Labor (DOL) to the Department of Health 
and Human Services (DHHS) and specifies procedures related to 
the transfer of functions.
    Section 10 (Effective Dates) sets the effective date for 
these amendments, with the exceptions that follow, as the date 
of enactment. Most requirements regarding the transfer of the 
senior community service employment program from DOL to AOA are 
effective July 1, 1996. Amendments to the Older Americans Act 
and conforming amendments are effective October 1, 1996.
                         VIII. Additional Views

                      interstate funding formulas

    We are also very troubled by the bill's changes in the 
funding formulas for SCSEP and the nutrition and social 
services programs. Changes were made in the formulas to address 
concerns raised by the GAO (``Older Americans Act: Funding 
Formula Could Better Reflect State Needs,'' US General 
Accounting Office, GAO/HEHS-94-41) that various hold-harmless 
clauses are unfair. But GAO's other recommended changes were 
not included. Specifically, the funding formula changes in the 
bill do not reflect the changing demographics and incomes of 
the elderly nor the differing abilities of States to raise the 
revenue necessary to provide those services. They also fail to 
take into account the differing cost of services in States.
    Although the intent of the change is to base the formula on 
more up-to-date demographics, the effect of this change pits 
State against State. It will cause disruption and loss of 
services to tens of thousands of older persons. Some States 
come out winners. Others are losers. Ten States that lose under 
this funding formula change already receive funding at or below 
the national average according to the GAO. These States are: 
Connecticut, California, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Virginia.

                                   Barbara A. Mikulski.

                                   Paul Simon.
                           IX. Minority Views

    For over 30 years, the Older Americans Act has been the 
primary source of community-based services for seniors. These 
programs have enabled seniors to live independently and with 
dignity in their communities. The need for services is 
increasingly important with the aging of our society. Over the 
last decade, the number of elderly has increased 25 percent. 
The over-85 population has grown especially rapidly, and will 
continue to grow. By the year 2030, those 60 and older will 
more than double to 85 million, while those 85 plus will triple 
to 8 million. At the same time the population is aging, 
however, available resources are dwindling.
    Senator Gregg's efforts to streamline the act to enable 
grantees to provide services more efficiently and cost-
effectively are laudable. The legislation consolidates specific 
titles and enhances State and local flexibility through new 
waiver authority.
    We worked with the majority to make several additions to 
the bill. These include assuring confidentiality for cost 
sharing of meals and clarifying that no one will be denied 
nutrition services based on inability to pay; giving priority 
to services for minority populations; and providing continued 
authority to the Administration on Aging for the operation of a 
nationwide toll-free number providing information on community 
elder care resources. Separate funding streams were retained 
for the long-term care ombudsman program and research and 
demonstration projects. The grant program for disease 
prevention and promotion was also retained.
    Despite these improvements to the bill, several concerns 
remain that make the legislation unacceptable. These include 
changing the way that the Senior Community Service Employment 
Program (SCSEP) is run. Other concerns include inadequate 
funding for legal assistance services and elder abuse 
prevention programs.

              senior community service employment program

    The Senior Community Service Employment Program is one of 
the largest programs funded under the OAA. It is operated by 
nine national grantees, all 50 States and territories, and the 
US Forest Service under the Department of Labor. The 
legislation transfers operation of the program to the 
Administration on Aging, a move supported by the Administration 
and committee members.
    In 1995, more than 100,000 older Americans participated in 
SCSEP. Participants are 55 years of age or older and have 
income that does not exceed 125 percent of the Federal poverty 
level. It is one of the most successful Federal job programs 
that exists today. The national sponsors have played a crucial 
role in developing the most effective employment, training and 
services program for older Americans. Their performance in 
placing participants in unsubsidized employment has 
consistently exceeded established goals and the performance of 
State-administered programs. In 1994, the job placement rate 
was 29 percent for national sponsors and 21 percent for States. 
National sponsors also have many years of experience in 
administering SCSEP.
    Unfortunately, the legislation turns this successfully run 
program over to the States for administration without adequate 
Federal oversight. It eliminates the authority of the Federal 
Government to provide direct grants to national sponsors. 
Although intended to give States more control, this move will 
be disruptive to seniors who are already in the program and 
will hurt further placement of seniors in jobs.
    Under the legislation, national sponsors can still compete 
for grants. This could turn into a ``bureaucrats's delight''. 
Rather than having sponsors compete for a standard national 
grant, the approach included in the bill could result in 50 
different standards and forms. According to the Urban 
Institute, in 1994, the national grantees operated programs in 
all but three States: Nevada, North Dakota, and Utah. This 
approach will not improve services to senior citizens. And it 
will not provide better services to communities. In fact, the 
opposite is suggested by a recent Urban Institute study. This 
study states ``Our analysis of possible program impacts 
indicate that based on current program performances, 
unsubsidized placements would decline, total number of 
individuals served would decline.'' (``Analysis of the Impacts 
of Proposed Legislative Changes in the Senior Community Service 
Employment Program'', Nancy M. Pindus and Pamela A. Holcomb, 
Urban Institute, March 8, 1996)
    A better approach to streamlining SCSEP is to retain the 
national sponsors but to build in accountability and 
performance standards. We strongly support retaining the 
national sponsors because they have an excellent record in 
administering the program. We believe national grantees--both 
national sponsors and States--should be held accountable to 
performance standards developed in consultation with the States 
and Federal Government. These standards should require a 
minimum of 20 percent job placement, fiscal accountability and 
annual reports on program activities. We supported an amendment 
to make these improvements to SCSEP and regret that it was not 
accepted by the committee.
    Under our approach, national sponsors and States would 
qualify for 2-year grants and be subject to rigorous evaluation 
based on quantifiable performance standards. At the end of 10 
months, sponsors could be evaluated. If problems were found and 
not corrected, the sponsor would lose the grant and be banned 
from the program. The program would then be opened to 
competition from other nonprofits. It also would cap 
administrative costs at 25 percent. In addition, over a 5-year 
period, it would increase the percentage of funds that go to 
States from 22 percent to 35 percent and decrease the 
percentage going to national organizations from 78 percent to 
65 percent. These changes to SCSEP would address the concerns 
raised in the GAO report. (``Senior Community Service 
Employment Program Delivery Could Be Improved Through 
Legislation and Administrative Actions'', U.S. General 
Accounting Office, GAO/HEHS-96-4, November 1995)

                              ELDER RIGHTS

    One of the most disheartening aspects of our society is the 
abuse of the elderly. Abuse of older persons has increased more 
than 100 percent over the last decade. One in 20 elderly 
Americans or roughly 1.5 million elderly are abused annually. 
Despite the widespread prevalence of this national tragedy, 
elder abuse is one of our nation's great ``silent'' epidemics. 
Elderly abuse is far less likely to be reported than child 
abuse. While 1 in 3 child abuse cases are reported, only 1 in 8 
elder abuse cases are reported. The victims of elder abuse are 
frequently 75 or older, frail and more often women. They are 
among our most vulnerable citizens.
    The legislation eliminates title VII of Elder Rights 
Protection Activities and folds the provisions of this title 
into the new title III of the bill with no separate funding 
(except for the ombudsman program). Under the bill, States are 
not required to provide any elder abuse programs. States under 
pressure from decreased funding can discontinue these services 
altogether. This program was originally created in recognition 
of the fact that State efforts to address a growing problem 
were inadequate. It is our view that States should be required 
to continue to provide these critical services.

                             LEGAL SERVICES

    The bill eliminates the mandate for a Legal Assistance 
program. We are disappointed that the committee rejected our 
amendment to assure maintenance of effort for legal services 
for the elderly. Legal services are a critical service under 
the act and assist the elderly in understanding their rights 
and accessing available services. Seniors frequently face 
diverse and complex legal problems including issues involving 
abuse and neglect, economic security, long-term care and 
guardianship. According to the American Bar Association, ``For 
many older persons, the Older Americans Act legal assistance 
program provides their only access to the justice system.''

                               CONCLUSION

    Historically, the Older Americans Act has enjoyed 
widespread bipartisan support. We are extremely disappointed 
that a program that has enjoyed such support for over 30 years 
has now become embroiled in controversy. It is unfortunate that 
the committee could not reach agreement on the outstanding 
issues, particularly the Senior Community Service Employment 
Program. Because of this, we are unable to support this bill. 
We are hopeful that changes can be made before consideration of 
the legislation on the floor of the Senate.

request only such information as the Commissioner deems 
essential to carry out the objectives and provisions of this

State agency (or in the case of a grantee under title VI, 
subject to the recommendation of the Associate Commissioner on 
American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Aging and

titles VIII and X of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and

except that (A) no State shall be allotted less than one-half 
of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for 
which the determination is made; (B) Guam, the United States 
Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands,

the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the 
determination is made; and (C) American Samoa and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be 
allotted not less than one-sixteenth of 1 percent of the sum 
appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is 
made. For the purposes of paragraph (3) and the exception 
contained in subparagraph (A) only, the term ``State'' does not

the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

to the Commissioner.
    [(b) Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount 
allotted to a State under part B or C for a fiscal year under 
this section will not be used by such State for carrying out 
the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Commissioner 
shall make such allotment available for carrying out such 
purpose to one or more other States to the extent the 
Commissioner determines that such other State will be able to 
use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any 
amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a 
fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, 
for purposes of this title, be regarded as part of such State's 
allotment (as determined under subsection (a)) for such year, 
but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding 
fiscal year.

under section 305(a)(2)(C), the Commissioner shall withhold the 
allotment of funds to such State referred to in subsection (a). 
The Commissioner shall disburse the funds so withheld directly 
to any public or private nonprofit institution or organization, 
agency, or political subdivision of such State submitting an 
approved plan under section 307, which includes an agreement

        but not more than 75 percent, of the cost of 
        administration of area plans;
          [(B) such amount (excluding any amount attributable 
        to funds appropriated under section 303(a)(3)) as the 
        State agency determines to be adequate for conducting 
        an effective ombudsman program under section 307(a)(12) 
        shall be available for conducting such program;
          [(C) not less than $150,000 and not more than 4 
        percent of the amount allotted to the State for 
        carrying out part B, shall be available for conducting 
        outreach demonstration projects under section 706; and
          [(D) the remainder of such allotment shall be 
        available to such State only for paying such percentage

        percent of the cost of supportive services, senior 
        centers, and nutrition services under this title 
        provided in the State as part of a comprehensive and

        which there is an area plan approved by the State 
        agency.
    [(2) The non-Federal share shall be in cash or in kind. In 
determining the amount of the non-Federal share, the 
Commissioner may attribute fair market value to services and 
facilities contributed from non-Federal sources.
    [(e) Grants made from allotments received under this title 
may be used for paying for the costs of providing for an area 
volunteer services coordinator (as described in section 
306(a)(12)) or a State volunteer services coordinator (as

                undertaken by the State agency.
      [(b)(1) In carrying out the requirement of subsection 
(a)(1), the State may designate as a planning and service area 
any unit of general purpose local government which has a 
population of 100,000 or more. In any case in which a unit of 
general purpose local government makes application to the State 
agency under the preceding sentence to be designated as a 
planning and service area, the State agency shall, upon 
request, provide an opportunity for a hearing to such unit of 
general purpose local government. A State may designate as a 
planning and service area under clause (1) of subsection (a) 
any region within the State recognized for purposes of areawide 
planning which includes one or more such units of general 
purpose local government when the State determines that the 
designation of such a regional planning and service area is 
necessary for, and will enhance, the effective administration 
of the programs authorized by this title. The State may include 
in any planning and service area designated under clause (1) of 
subsection (a) such additional areas adjacent to the unit of 
general purpose local government or regionals so designated as 
the State determines to be necessary for, and will enhance the 
effective administration of the programs authorized by this 
title.

requirement of clause (1) of subsection (a) to include the area 
covered by the appropriate economic development district 
involved in any planning and service area designated under 
subsection (a)(1), and to include all portions of an Indian 
reservation within a single planning and service area, if 
feasible.
      [(3) The chief executive officer of each State in which a 
planning and service area crosses State boundaries, or in which 
an interstate Indian reservation is located, may apply to the 
Commissioner to request redesignation as an interstate planning 
and service area comprising the entire metropolitan area or 
Indian reservation. If the Commissioner approves such an 
application, the Commissioner shall adjust the State allotments 
of the areas within the planning and Service area in which the 
interstate planning and service area is established to reflect 
the number of older individuals within the area who will be 
served by an interstate planning and service area not within 
the State.
    [(4) Whenever a unit of general purpose local government, a 
region, a metropolitan area or an Indian reservation is denied 
designation under the provisions of subsection (a)(1), such 
unit of general purpose local government, region, metropolitan 
area, or Indian reservation may appeal the decision of the 
State agency to the Commissioner. The Commissioner shall afford 
such unit, region, metropolitan area, or Indian reservation an 
opportunity for a hearing. In carrying out the provisions of 
this paragraph, the Commissioner may approve the decision of 
the State agency, disapprove the decision of the State agency 
and require the State agency to designate the unit, region, 
area, or Indian reservation appealing the decision as a 
planning and service area, or take such other action as the 
Commissioner deems appropriate.
    [(5)(A) A State which on or before October 1, 1980, had 
designated, with the approval of the Commissioner, a single 
planning and service area covering all of the older individuals 
in the State, in which the State agency was administering the 
area plan, may after that date designate one or more additional 
planning and service areas within the State to be administered 
by public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations as 
area agencies on aging, after considering the factors specified 
in subsection (a)(1)(E). The State agency shall continue to 
perform the functions of an area agency on aging for any area 
of the State not included in a planning and service area for 
which an area agency on aging has been designated.
    [(B) Whenever a State agency designates a new area agency 
on aging after the date of enactment of the Older Americans Act 
Amendments of 1984, the State agency shall give the right to 
first refusal to a unit of general purpose local government if 
(i) such unit can meet the requirements of subsection (c), and 
(ii) the boundaries of such a unit and the boundaries of the 
area are reasonably contiguous.
    [(C)(i) A State agency shall establish and follow 
appropriate procedures to provide due process to affected 
parties, if the State agency initiates an action or proceeding 
to--
          [(I) revoke the designation of the area agency on 
        aging under subsection (a);
          [(II) designate an additional planning and service 
        area in a State;
          [(III) divide the State into different planning and 
        services areas; or
          [(IV) otherwise affect the boundaries of the planning 
        and service areas in the State.
    [(ii) The procedures described in clause (i) shall include 
procedures for--
          [(I) providing notice of an action or proceeding 
        described in clause (i);
          [(II) documenting the need for the action or 
        proceeding;
          [(III) conducting a public hearing for the action or

          [(8) The plan shall provide that the State agency 
        will conduct periodic evaluations of, and public 
        hearings on, activities and projects carried out under 
        the State plan, including an evaluation of the 
        effectiveness of the State agency in reaching older 
        individuals with greatest economic need and older 
        individuals with greatest social need, with particular 
        attention to low-income minority individuals. In 
        conducting such evaluations and public hearings, the 
        State agency shall solicit the views and experiences of 
        entities that are knowledgable about the needs and 
        concerns of low-income minority older individuals.
          [(9) The plan shall provide for establishing and 
        maintaining information and assistance services in 
        sufficient numbers to assure that all older individuals 
        in the State who are not furnished adequate information 
        and assistance services under section 306(a)(4) will 
        have reasonably convenient access to such services.
          [(10) The plan shall provide that no supportive 
        services, nutrition services, or in-home services (as 
        defined in section 342) will be directly provided by 
        the State agency or an area agency on aging, except 
        where, in the judgment of the State agency, provision 
        of such services by the State agency or an area agency 
        on aging is necessary to assure an adequate supply of 
        such services, or where such services are directly 
        related to such State or area agency on aging's 
        administrative functions, or where such services of 
        comparable quality can be provided more economically by 
        such State or area agency on aging.
          [(11) The plan shall provide that subject to the 
        requirements of merit employment systems of State and 
        local governments--
                  [(A) preference shall be given to older 
                individuals; and
                  [(B) special consideration shall be given to 
                individuals with formal training in the field 
                of aging (including an educational specialty or

                certificate in aging) or equivalent 
                professional experience in the field of aging;
        for any staff positions (full time or part time) in 
        State and area agencies for which such individuals 
        qualify.
          [(12) The plan shall provide assurances that the 
        State agency will carry out, through the Office of the 
        State Long-Term Care Ombudsman, a State Long-Term Care 
        Ombudsman program in accordance with section 712 and 
        this title.
          [(13) The plan shall provide with respect to 
        nutrition services that--
                  [(A) each project providing nutrition 
                services will be available to older individuals 
                and to their spouses, and may be made available 
                to handicapped or disabled individuals who have 
                not attained 60 years of age but who reside in 
                housing facilities occupied primarily by older 
                individuals at which congregate nutrition 
                services are provided;

                such organizations also provide meals to older 
                individuals in a congregate setting; and (ii) 
                shall, in awarding such funds, select such 
                organizations in a manner which complies with 
                the provisions of subparagraph (H);

                meals, and to provide other supportive services 
                directly related to nutrition services;
                  [(D) in the case of meals served in a 
                congregate setting, a site for such services 
                and for comprehensive supportive services is 
                furnished in as close proximity to the majority 
                of eligible individuals' residences as 
                feasible, with particular attention upon a 
                multipurpose senior center, a school, a church,

                  [(E) each project will establish outreach 
                activities which assure that the maximum number

                from non-Federal sources;
                  [(I) each area agency on aging shall 
                establish procedures that will allow nutrition

        leadership in developing legal assistance programs for 
        older individuals throughout the State.
         [(19) The plan shall provide, with respect to 
        education and training services, assurances that area 
        agencies on aging may enter into grants and contracts 
        with providers of education and training services which 
        can demonstrate the experience or capacity to provide 
        such services (except that such contract authority 
        shall be effective for any fiscal year only to such 
        extent, or in such amounts, as are provided in 
        appropriations Acts).
         [(20) The plan shall provide assurances that, if a 
        substantial number of the older individuals residing in 
        any planning and service area in the State are of 
        limited English-speaking ability, then the State will 
        require the area agency on aging for each such planning 
        and service area--
                 [(A) to utilize in the delivery of outreach 
                services under section 306(a)(2)(A), the 
                services of workers who are fluent in the 
                language spoken by a predominant number of such

                speaking ability; and
                 [(B) to designate an individual employed by

                        older individuals who are of limited 
                        English-speaking ability in order to 
                        assist such older individuals in 
                        participating in programs and receiving 
                        assistance under this Act; and
                         [(ii) providing guidance to 
                        individuals engaged in the delivery of 
                        supportive services under the area plan 
                        involved to enable such individuals to 
                        be aware of cultural sensitivities and 
                        to take into account effectively 
                        linguistic and cultural differences.
         [(21) The plan shall provide assurances that the State 
        agency, in carrying out the State Long-Term Care 
        Ombudsman program under section 307(a)(12), will expend 
        not less than the total amount expended by the agency 
        in fiscal year 1991 in carrying out such a program 
        under this title.
         [(22) The plan shall specify a minimum percentage of 
        the funds received by each area agency on aging for 
        part B that will be expended, in the absence of the 
        waiver granted under section 306(b)(1), by any such 
        area agency on aging to provide each of the categories 
        of service specified in section 306(a)(2).
         [(23) The plan shall, with respect to the fiscal year 
        preceding the fiscal year for which such plan is

                 [(A) identify individuals eligible for 
                assistance under this Act, with special 
                emphasis on--

                        brain dysfunction (and the caretakers 
                        of such individuals); and

                the availability of such assistance;
         [(25) The plan shall provide, with respect to the 
        needs of older individuals with severe disabilities, 
        assurances that the State will coordinate planning, 
        identification, assessment of needs, and service for

        attention to individuals with severe disabilities with 
        the State agencies with primary responsibility for 
        individuals with disabilities, including severe 
        disabilities, and develop collaborative programs, where 
        appropriate, to meet the needs of older individuals 
        with disabilities.
         [(26) The plan shall provide assurances that area 
        agencies on aging will conduct efforts to facilitate 
        the coordination of community-based, long-term care 
        services, pursuant to section 306(a)(6)(I), for older 
        individuals who--
                 [(A) reside at home and are at risk of 
                institutionalization because of limitations on 
                their ability to function independently;
                 [(B) are patients in hospitals and are at risk 
                of prolonged institutionalization; or

        which administer and provide services relating to 
        health, social services, rehabilitation, and mental 
        health services.
          [(28) The plan shall provide assurances that if the 
        State receives funds appropriated under section 303(e), 
        the State agency and area agencies on aging will expend 
        such funds to carry out part E.
          [(29) The plan shall, with respect to the fiscal year 
        preceding the fiscal year for which such plan is 
        prepared, describe the methods used to satisfy the 
        service needs of older individuals who reside in rural 
        areas.
          [(30) The plan shall include the assurances and 
        description required by section 705(a).
          [(31)(A) If 50 percent or more of the area plans in 
        the State provide for an area volunteer services 
        coordinator, as described in section 306(a)(12), the 
        State plan shall provide for a State volunteer services 
        coordinator, who shall--
                  [(i) encourage area agencies on aging to 
                provide for area volunteer services 
                coordinators;
                  [(ii) coordinate the volunteer services 
                offered between the various area agencies on 
                aging;
                  [(iii) encourage, organize, and promote the 
                use of older individuals as volunteers to the 
                State;
                  [(iv) provide technical assistance, which may

        subparagraph (A).
          [(32) The plan shall provide assurances that special 
        efforts will be made to provide technical assistance to

        State agency will coordinate programs under this title 
        and title VI, if applicable.
          [(35) The plan shall--
                  [(A) provide an assurance that the State

                access by older individuals who are Native 
                Americans to all aging programs and benefits 
                provided by the agency, including programs and

                agency intends to implement the activities.
          [(36) If case management services are offered to 
        provide access to supportive services, the plan shall 
        provide that the State agency shall ensure compliance 
        with the requirements specified in section 306(a)(20).
          [(37) The plan shall identify for each fiscal year, 
        the actual and projected additional costs of providing 
        services under this title, including the cost of 
        providing access to such services, to older individuals 
        residing in rural areas in the State (in accordance 
        with a standard definition of rural areas specified by 
        the Commissioner).
          [(38) The plan shall provide assurances that funds 
        received under this title will not be used to pay any 
        part of a cost (including an administrative cost) 
        incurred by the State or an area agency on aging to 
        carry out a contract or commercial relationship that is 
        not carried out to implement this title.
          [(39) The plan shall provide assurances that 
        preference in receiving services under this title will 
        not be given by the area agency on aging to particular 
        older individuals as a result of a contract or 
        commercial relationship that is not carried out to 
        implement this title.
          [(40) The plan shall provide assurances that if the 
        State receives funds appropriated under section 303(g) 
        the State agency and area agencies on aging will expend 
        such funds to carry out part G.
          [(41) The plan shall provide assurances that 
        demonstrable efforts will be made--
                  [(A) to coordinate services provided under 
                this Act with other State services that benefit 
                older individuals; and

                treatment, and family support programs.
          [(42) The plan shall provide assurances that the 
        State will coordinate public services within the State 
        to assist older individuals to obtain transportation 
        services associated with access to services provided 
        under this title, to services under title VI, to 
        comprehensive counseling services, and to legal 
        assistance.
          [(43) The plan shall provide that the State agency 
        shall issue guidelines applicable to grievance 
        procedures required by section 306(a)(6)(P).
          [(44) The plan shall include assurances that the 
        State has in effect a mechanism to provide for quality 
        in the provision of in-home services under this title.
    [(b)(1) The Commissioner shall approve any State plan which 
the Commissioner finds fulfills the requirements of subsection 
(a), except the Commissioner may not approve such plan unless 
the Commissioner determines that the formula submitted under 
section 305(a)(2)(D) complies with the guidelines in effect 
under section 305(a)(2)(C).
    [(2) The Commissioner, in approving any State plan under 
this section, may waive the requirement described in paragraph 
(3)(B) of subsection (a) if the State agency demonstrates to 
the Commissioner that the service needs of older individuals 
residing in rural areas in the State are being met, or that the 
number of older individuals residing in such rural areas is not 
sufficient to require the State agency to comply with the 
requirement described in clause (3)(B) of subsection (a).
    [(c)(1) The Commissioner shall not make a final 
determination disapproving any State plan, or any modification 
thereof, or make a final determination that a State is 
ineligible under section 305, without first affording the State 
reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.
    [(2) Not later than 30 days after such final determination, 
a State dissatisfied with such final determination may appeal 
such final determination to the Secretary for review. If the 
State timely appeals such final determination in accordance 
with subsection (e)(1), the Secretary shall dismiss the appeal 
filed under this paragraph.
    [(3) If the State is dissatisfied with the decision of the 
Secretary after review under paragraph (2), the State may 
appeal such decision not later than 30 days after such decision 
and in the manner described in subsection (e). For purposes of 
appellate review under the preceding sentence, a reference in 
subsection (e) to the Commissioner shall be deemed to be a 
reference to the Secretary.
    [(d) Whenever the Commissioner, after reasonable notice and 
opportunity for a hearing to the State agency, finds that--
          [(1) the State is not eligible under section 305,
          [(2) the State plan has been so changed that it no 
        longer complies substantially with the provisions of 
        subsection (a), or
          [(3) in the administration of the plan there is a 
        failure to comply substantially with any such provision 
        of subsection (a),
the Commissioner shall notify such State agency that no further 
payments from its allotments under section 304 and section 308 
will be made to the State (or, in the Commissioner's 
discretion, that further payments to the State will be limited 
to projects under or portions of the State plan not affected by 
such failure), until the Commissioner is satisfied that there 
will no longer be any failure to comply. Until the Commissioner 
is so satisfied, no further payments shall be made to such 
State from its allotments under section 304 and section 308 (or 
payments shall be limited to projects under or portions of the 
State plan not affected by such failure). The Commissioner 
shall, in accordance with regulations the Commissioner shall 
prescribe, disburse the funds so withheld directly to any 
public or nonprofit private organization or agency or political 
subdivision of such State submitting an approved plan in 
accordance with the provisions of this section. Any such 
payment shall be matched in the proportions specified in 
section 304.
    [(e)(1) A state which is dissatisfied with a final action 
of the Commissioner under subsection (b), (c), or (d) may 
appeal to the United States court of appeals for the circuit in 
which the State is located, by filing a petition with such 
court within 30 days after such final action. A copy of the 
petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the 
court to the Commissioner, or any officer designated by the 
Commissioner for such purpose. The Commissioner thereupon shall 
file in the court the record of the proceedings on which the 
Commissioner's action is based, as provided in section 2112 of 
title 28, United States Code.
    [(2) Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have 
jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Commissioner or to set 
it aside, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently, but 
until the filing of the record, the Commissioner may modify or 
set aside the Commissioner's order. The findings of the 
Commissioner as to the facts, if supported by substantial 
evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause 
shown may remand the case to the Commissioner to take further 
evidence, and the Commissioner shall, within 30 days, file in 
the court the record of those further proceedings. Such new or 
modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if 
supported by substantial evidence. The judgment of the court 
affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any action of 
the Commissioner shall be final, subject to review by the 
Supreme Court of the United States upon certioriari or 
certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28, United 
States Code.
    [(3) The commencement of proceedings under this subsection 
shall not, unless so specifically ordered by the court, operate 
as a stay of the Commissioner's action.
    [(f)(1) Neither a State, nor a State agency, may require 
any provider of legal assistance under this title to reveal any 
information that is protected by the attorney-client privilege.
    [(2) Information disclosed under section 306(a)(14)(B)(i) 
or subsection (a)(7)(C)(ii)(I) may be disclosed to the public 
by the State agency or the State only if such information could 
be disclosed under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, 
by an agency of the United States.

administration of area plans.
    [(3) Any State which has been designated a single planning 
and service area under section 305(a)(1)(E) covering all, or 
substantially all, of the older individuals in such State, as

or allotted under both such sections.
    [(b)(1) If for any fiscal year the aggregate amount

        Mariana Islands, the greater of 5 percent of such 
        allotment of $75,000;
shall be available to such State to carry out the purposes of 
this section.
    [(2) If for any fiscal year the aggregate amount

        allotment of $100,000;
shall be available to such State to carry out the purposes of 
this section.
    [(3)(A) If the aggregate amount appropriated, under section

administration of its State plan in accordance with subsection 
(a) may transmit an application to the Commissioner in 
accordance with this paragraph. Any such application shall be 
transmitted in such form, and according to such procedures, as 
the Commissioner may require, except that such application may 
not be made as part of, or as an amendment to, the State plan.
    [(B) The Commissioner may approve any application 
transmitted by a State under subparagraph (A) if the 
Commissioner determines, based upon a particularized showing of 
need that--
          [(i) the State will be unable to fully and 
        effectively administer its State plan and to carry out 
        programs and projects authorized by this title unless 
        such additional amounts are made available by the

to funds appropriated under part B or part C (including funds 
transferred under paragraph (A) without regard to this

the need for services under such part, then the Commissioner 
may grant a waiver that permits the State to transfer under

annual expenditures from such sources for the period of 3 
fiscal years preceding such year.

individuals in excess of amounts reimbursable under this 
section, by using funds made available to them under other 
sections of this Act or under other provisions of Federal or 
State law, or from private sources.

under the provisions of this section unless the State submits 
final reimbursement claims for meals within 90 days after the 
last day of the quarter for which the reimbursement is claimed.

fiscal year in which compliance with subsection (a)(4) of this

reallotted, from time to time and on such dates during such 
year as the Secretary may fix, to projects within other States 
in proportion to the original allotments to projects within 
such States under subsection (a) for such year, but with such 
proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced 
to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates that 
projects within such State need and will be able to use for 
such year; and the total of such reductions shall be similarly 
reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were 
not so reduced. Any amount reallotted to a State under this 
subsection during a year shall be deemed part of its allotment 
under subsection (a) for such year.
    [(c) The amount apportioned for projects within each State 
under subsection (a) shall be apportioned among areas within 
each such State in an equitable manner, taking into 
consideration (1) the proportion which eligible individuals in

such individuals residing in rural and urban areas within the 
State, and (3) the relative distribution of (A) such

                affirming or setting aside, in whole or in

                  (C) evaluating the effectiveness of the use 
                of resources in meeting such need; and
                  (D) entering into agreements with providers

                provision of such services or centers to meet 
                such need.

                disease or related disorders and with 
                neurological or organic brain dysfunction (and 
                the caretakers of such individuals).

                  (B) remove religious art, icons, scripture, 
                or other symbols;
        in order to be eligible to receive a grant or contract

        this paragraph is an individual who receives, applies

        or regulation that relates to discrimination in 
        employment on the basis of religion.
          (2) Exception.--A religious organization with a grant 
        or contract referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A), or

under this section violated may enforce its claim exclusively 
by asserting a civil action for such relief as may be 
appropriate, including injunctive relief or damages, in an

        an assurance that the applicant will adopt procedures 
        on receipt of the grant to ensure against duplicate 
        services being provided to the same recipients.

Secretary determines that the Assistant Secretary will not
