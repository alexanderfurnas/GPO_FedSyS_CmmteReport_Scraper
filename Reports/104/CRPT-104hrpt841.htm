                                   Bill Cohen,

                                Managers on the Part of the Senate.
       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2977) to 
reauthorize alternative means of dispute resolution in the 
Federal administrative process, and for other purposes, submit 
the following joint statement to the House and the Senate in 
explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the 
managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report:
      The Senate amendment to the text of the bill struck all 
of the House bill after the enacting clause and inserted a 
substitute text.
      The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the Senate with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
House bill and the Senate amendment. The differences between 
the House bill, the Senate amendment, and the substitute agreed 
to in conference are noted below, except for clerical 
corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements 
reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clerical 
changes.
      The conferees incorporate by reference in this Statement 
of Managers the legislative history reflected in both House 
Report 104-597 and Senate Report 104-245. To the extent not 
otherwise inconsistent with the conference agreement, those 
reports give expression to the intent of the conferees.
      Section 3--House recedes to Senate amendment with 
modifications. This section clarifies that, under 5 U.S.C. 
section 574, a dispute resolution communication between a party 
and a neutral or a neutral and a party that meets the 
requirements for confidentiality in section 574 is also exempt 
from disclosure under FOIA. In addition, a dispute resolution 
communication originating from a neutral and provided to all of 
the parties, such as Early Neutral Evaluation, is protected 
from discovery under 574(b)(7) and from disclosure under FOIA. 
A dispute resolution communication originating from a party to 
a party or parties is not protected from disclosure by the ADR 
Act.
      The Managers recognize that the intent of the Conference 
Agreement not to exempt from disclosure under FOIA a dispute 
resolution communication given by one party to another party 
could be easily thwarted if a neutral in receipt of a dispute 
resolution communication agrees with a party to in turn pass 
the communication on to another party. It is the intent of the 
Managers that if the neutral attempts to circumvent the 
prohibitions of the ADR Act in this manner, the exemption from 
FOIA would not apply.
      As with all other FOIA exemptions, the exemption created 
by section 574(j) is to be construed narrowly. The Managers 
would not expect the parties to use the new exemption as a mere 
sham to exempt information from FOIA. Thus, for example, we 
would not expect litigants to resort to ADR principally as a 
means of taking advantage of the new exemption. In such a case 
the new exemption would not apply.
      Section 7--Senate recedes to House with a modification. 
This section requires the President to designate an agency or 
to designate or establish an interagency committee to 
facilitate and encourage the use of alternative dispute 
resolution. The Managers encourage the President to designate 
the same entity under this provision as is designated under 
section 11 (regarding Negotiated Rulemaking). This would 
promote the coordination of policies, enhance institutional 
memory on the relevant issues, and make more efficient the use 
of ADR and Negotiated Rulemaking.
      Section 8--House recedes to Senate amendment with 
modifications. This section permits the use of binding 
arbitration under certain conditions, and clarifies that an 
agency cannot exceed its otherwise applicable settlement 
authority in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.
      The head of an agency that is a party to an arbitration 
proceeding will no longer have the authority to terminate the 
proceeding or vacate any award under 5 U.S.C. section 580. 
However, it is the Managers' intent that an arbitrator shall 
not grant an award that is inconsistent with law. In addition, 
prior to the use of binding arbitration, the head of each 
agency, in consultation with the Attorney General, must issue 
guidelines on the use and limitations of binding arbitration.
      Section 11--House recedes to Senate amendment with 
modifications. This section permanently reauthorizes the 
Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990. The President is required to 
designate an agency or interagency committee to facilitate and 
encourage the use of negotiated rulemaking.
      In addition, this section requires the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget to take action to expedite the 
establishment of negotiated rulemaking committees and 
committees to resolve disputes under the Administrative Dispute 
Resolution Act. It is the understanding of the Managers that 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) applies to 
proceedings under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, but does not 
apply to proceedings under the Administrative Dispute 
Resolution Act. The Director also is required to submit 
recommendations to Congress for any necessary legislative 
changes within one year after enactment.
      The Managers deleted language in paragraph (b)(1)(B) 
determining that property accepted under this section shall be 
considered a gift to the United States for federal tax purposes 
because the Managers determined that the language merely 
repeated current law.
      Secton 12--House recedes to Senate amendment with 
modifications. This section consolidates federal court 
jurisdiction for procurement protest cases in the Court of 
Federal Claims. Previously, in addition to the jurisdiction 
exercised by the Court of Federal Claims, certain procurement 
protest cases were subject to review in the federal district 
courts. The grant of exclusive federal court jurisdiction to 
the Court of Federal Claims does not affect in any way the 
authority of the Comptroller General to review procurement 
protests pursuant to Chapter 35 of Title 31, U.S. Code.
      This section also applies the Administrative Procedure 
Act standard of review previously applied by the district 
courts (5 U.S.C. sec. 706) to all procurement protest cases in 
the Court of Federal Claims. It is the intention of the 
Managers to give the Court of Federal Claims exclusive 
jurisdiction over the full range of procurement protest cases 
previously subject to review in the federal district courts and 
the Court of Federal Claims. This section is not intended to 
affect the jurisdiction or standards applied by the Court of 
Federal Claims in any other area of the law.
