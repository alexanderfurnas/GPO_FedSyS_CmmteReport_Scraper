Hon. Newt Gingrich,
The Speaker,
U.S. House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Speaker:  I am pleased to transmit herewith a 
report on the activities of the Committee on Appropriations 
during the 104th Congress, pursuant to Clause 1(d) of Rule XI 
of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
    The House Committee on Appropriations of the 104th 
Congress, the first Republican majority Congress since the 83d 
Congress, fulfilled its obligations in an outstanding manner. 
The cumulative spending reduction of our bills for both 
sessions was $49 billion less than the enacted fiscal year 1995 
level. I am particularly proud of the Committee's efforts to 
assist in bringing the Federal Budget into balance by 2002.
    On behalf of myself and the entire membership of the 
Committee, I would like to express my appreciation for the 
cooperation we received from you, the other Members of the 
Leadership, and all Members of the House of Representatives.
    With best regards,
            Sincerely,
                                            Bob Livingston,
                                                          Chairman.

  REPORT ON ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS DURING THE 
                             104TH CONGRESS

                                _______
                                

 December 19, 1996.--Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on 
            the State of the Union and ordered to be printed

_______________________________________________________________________


  Mr. Livingston, from the Committee on Appropriations, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

    The Committee on Appropriations is the principal arm 
through which the House of Representatives exercises its 
constitutional responsibility to provide funds for the 
operations of the various activities of the Federal Government. 
Clause 1(b) of Rule X of the House provides that the Committee 
shall have jurisdiction over the ``Appropriation of the revenue 
for the support of the Government.'' This responsibility has 
basically been vested in the Committee since 1865.
    The Committee has been established by the House with a 
membership of 58 during the 104th Congress. With relatively few 
exceptions, the responsibilities of the Committee are carried 
out through its 13 Subcommittees which in turn report to the 
full Committee. The Subcommittees are organized essentially on 
a functional basis with recognition of the existing structure 
of the Departments and agencies within the Executive Branch. 
(The jurisdictional assignments of Subcommittees during the 
104th Congress are displayed in Appendix C.)

                                  (1)

      

                   SUMMARY OF APPROPRIATIONS ACTIONS

    During the 104th Congress, the Committee developed bills 
whose overall appropriation savings for both sessions was $49 
billion less than the overall fiscal year 1995 total. These 
bills eliminated funding for 297 programs thereby causing their 
termination. While downsizing government and cutting 
bureaucracy, these bills preserved and even increased spending 
on a number of priority programs, including: Important medical 
research at the National Institutes of Health (up 11 percent in 
fiscal year 1996 and 6.5 percent in fiscal year 1997); greater 
protection along our Nation's borders ($10 million added to the 
President's fiscal year 1997 request for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service); a revival of the stalled War on Drugs 
(funded an $8.8 billion initiative); and essential funding to 
combat violence against women ($14.5 million added to the 
President's fiscal year 1997 request).
    Additionally, appropriations bills developed by the 
Committee preserved funding for our national security thereby 
maintaining a strong national defense.
    During the 104th Congress, the 13 Subcommittees conducted 
457 days of hearings, receiving testimony from 6,999 witnesses. 
In the process, 170 volumes of hearings were generated, 
comprising 174,576 printed pages. The Committee also initiated 
or completed 63 reports from its Surveys and Investigations 
Staff and had underway or completed an additional 191 reports 
from the General Accounting Office during the 104th Congress.
    The following is a tabular display of the appropriations 
actions of the Committee during the 104th Congress indicating 
the various bill numbers, dates, report numbers, amounts, and 
public law numbers:

                     Fiscal Year 1996 Supplementals

                       2d Session--104th Congress

    There were no individual supplemental appropriations bills 
developed during the second session of the 104th Congress. 
Various fiscal year 1996 supplemental appropriations were made 
in the fiscal year 1997 regular bills.

                Continuing Resolutions--Fiscal Year 1997

                       2d Session--104th Congress

    As all regular appropriations for fiscal year 1997 were 
enacted by September 30, 1996, no continuing resolutions were 
necessary for fiscal year 1997 appropriations.

                Omnibus Consolidations--Fiscal Year 1997

H.R. 3610--The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997. 
        Provides full year funding for the programs in the 
        regular individual bills not enacted in addition to 
        Department of Defense appropriations which this bill 
        initially only contained; H.R. 3814, H.R. 3540, H.R. 
        3662, H.R. 3755, H.R. 3756. Approved September 30, 1996 
        (P.L. 104-208).

                      FISCAL YEAR 1996 HIGHLIGHTS

    The Committee's first legislative action in the 104th 
Congress was to develop a $3 billion fiscal year 1995 defense 
supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 889, that was offset 
with rescissions of previously appropriated fiscal year 1995 
funding. Additionally, the Committee developed a $16.4 billion 
rescissions bill, H.R. 1944, which included $6.7 billion of 
emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance 
in 40 states and $250 million for emergency recovery activities 
associated with the Oklahoma City bombing. All of these 
appropriations were offset with fiscal year 1995 rescissions.
    For the first time since the Budget Act was adopted, 
emergency supplemental appropriations bills were offset with 
rescissions of previous appropriations, rather than taking this 
type of spending off budget which increases the deficit. This 
new approach was to continue through the 104th Congress.
    Eight of the fiscal year 1996 regular appropriations bills 
were enacted as separate bills. The other five were included in 
one bill, H.R. 3019, which was enacted in April of 1996. As 
these bills were not enacted by October 1, 1995, several 
continuing resolutions were needed until their enactments 
occurred. In total, these bills were $22 billion below the 
previous year's enacted appropriations levels. Funding for 270 
Federal programs was eliminated from these bills causing these 
programs to be terminated.
      

                      FISCAL YEAR 1997 HIGHLIGHTS

    Action on appropriations bills during the second session of 
the 104th Congress was much more timely. All 13 regular 
appropriations bills had passed the House by July 25, 1996. Six 
separate regular bills were enacted. Six others were 
consolidated into the defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3610, 
thus completing appropriations action for fiscal year 1997. 
This consolidated bill was enacted on September 30, 1996, prior 
to the beginning of the fiscal year. In total, 27 more programs 
had funding eliminated and the overall appropriations level was 
$11 billion below the fiscal year 1995 level.

                             OVERSIGHT PLAN

    Pursuant to clause 2(d)(1) of Rule X the Committee 
submitted the following Oversight Plan on February 10, 1995.
    ``For the 104th Congress the Committee intends to proceed 
in the following manner:
    1. Budget Overview Hearings. Immediately upon receipt of 
the President's budget the Committee will conduct its annual 
budget overview hearing on the recommendations of the 
President. This hearing on the fiscal year 1996 Budget will 
take testimony from the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman 
of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
    2. Subcommittee Hearings. The Appropriations Committee has 
a long tradition of in-depth analysis of the President's 
pending budget as well as the effective use of previously 
appropriated resources. For example, during the 103d Congress 
the Committee on Appropriations held 548 days of hearings, took 
testimony from 9,955 witnesses, and published 180 volumes of 
hearings totaling 187,974 pages. This level of oversight and 
investigation will continue during this Congress.
    3. Investigations. In addition to formal oversight, the 
Committee utilizes various investigative agencies to conduct 
in-depth analysis of specific problem areas. These 
investigations are conducted by the Committee's own Surveys and 
Investigations Staff, the General Accounting Office, the 
Congressional Research Service, and the Office of Technology 
Assessment. In the previous Congress, the Committee received 87 
Surveys and Investigations studies and 152 investigative 
reports from the GAO.
    4. Appropriations Bills. The ultimate exercise of oversight 
is the `power of the purse' which the Committee takes as its 
highest responsibility. This allocation of scarce Federal 
dollars demands strict compliance with all budgetary concepts 
and strictures. The Committee intends to follow the 
requirements of the Congressional Budget and Control Act with 
regard to the subdivision of budget authority and outlays to 
the 13 subcommittees. Appropriations bills will be developed in 
accordance with the results of all the oversight activities in 
paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, above and brought to the floor for 
consideration within all relevant budgetary constraints.''

                           Oversight Actions

    For the 104th Congress, the Committee completely 
accomplished its oversight plan. A fiscal year 1996 Budget 
overview hearing was conducted. As stated earlier, the 
Committee conducted extensive hearings. In the matter following 
this section, the details of investigations conducted by and 
for the Committee are provided. As a result of these hearings 
and investigations, the Committee was able to produce 
appropriations bills that were signed into law that saved $49 
billion from the fiscal year 1995 enacted level.
               INVESTIGATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE COMMITTEE

    In addition to and in support of the regular hearing 
process, the Committee conducted numerous studies of Federal 
projects and activities designed to assist in reaching 
decisions on specific funding levels covering a wide range of 
subjects. These studies were conducted by the Committee's 
Surveys and Investigations Staff, which has been in continuous 
existence since 1943.
    The Committee has, over a number of years, delegated the 
authority to originate requests for investigations to its 
Subcommittees, with the concurrence of the Chairman and Ranking 
Minority Member of the Full Committee required to implement 
such requests.
    When an investigation is ordered, expert investigators are 
assembled to conduct it and render a report thereon for the use 
of the Committee. The Committee delegates to this Staff the 
responsibility for selection of individual investigators, the 
criteria being competence and objectivity.
    During the 104th Congress, the Surveys and Investigations 
Staff was tasked to conduct 47 investigations of operations and 
programs of various departments and agencies of the Federal 
Government and, in addition, completed and reported to the 
Committee on 16 investigations that had been directed during 
previous Congresses. Some of these efforts were of long 
duration, resulted in the preparation of multiple investigative 
products, and involved a sizable number of investigators. 
Examples of this type investigation include an examination of 
the Department of Defense Financial Management Systems; Open 
Source Programs of the Defense and Intelligence Communities; 
Department of Defense Tactical Communications Programs; and 
U.S. Navy Family Housing in Naples, Italy.
    Other investigations of shorter duration and with fewer 
investigators assigned, provided a quick response to the 
Committee. An example of such an inquiry was the one dealing 
with the preparation and operation of interim and permanent 
airheads for the National Training Center, at Fort Irwin, 
California. This effort was highly focused and the period from 
its request to its completion was less than 8 weeks.
    Most investigations undertaken by the Surveys and 
Investigations Staff fell somewhere in between the above 
extremes in terms of duration and the number of investigators 
committed. Notable examples of investigations conducted during 
the 104th Congress include:
        --the U.S. Army's rotary wing aircraft inventory and 
        future plans for upgrading the fleet;
        --the modernization of the U.S. Army's armored vehicle 
        systems;
        --the technical and policy issues associated with the 
        construction of the international wastewater treatment 
        plant near San Diego, California;
        --the implementation of the Department of Defense 
        managed health care program;
        --technical issues impacting on the effectiveness of 
        the broadcasts of TV Marti into Cuba;
        --the management and operations of the Federal Election 
        Commission;
        --the effectiveness and funding sources of joint 
        Federal, State, and local law enforcement task forces.
    During the 104th Congress, a total of 95 professionals, 
variously consisting of a small number of permanent staff, 
personnel on loan from 8 agencies of the Federal Government, as 
well as contractors were utilized to conduct these 
investigations and prepare the reports. A summary of the 
investigations requested by the various Subcommittees and 
completed or started during the 104th Congress follows. Ten 
investigations dealt with classified intelligence matters and 
consequently are not otherwise identified below.

    With respect to the above listing, it should be noted that 
since the studies originate with the Subcommittees, any 
information developed during the course of an investigation is 
reported to the Subcommittee which requested such study or 
examination as well as the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member 
of the Full Committee. This information may be released for 
publication only when the Subcommittee so determines as 
provided by Section 8 of the Committee's rules.

                      SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE GAO

    In addition to the information made available to the 
Committee through its Surveys and Investigation Staff, the 
Committee also utilizes the resources of the General Accounting 
Office. The Committee receives a copy of every GAO report 
addressed to the Congress. In recent years the scope of the GAO 
auditing and review capability has been enlarged to include 
management surveys. For over 20 years the GAO has extracted 
from those reports and compiled in separate volumes a list of 
so-called ``significant audit findings'' for special use by the 
Committee staff in the annual appropriations hearings. These 
findings relate to matters which are felt to require corrective 
action by the Committee's efforts, through legislation, or 
through administrative efforts. This compilation is designed to 
identify problem areas in an individual agency which might have 
applicability to other organizations.
    Additionally, the Committee frequently calls upon GAO to 
make special studies and investigations.
    A listing of some reports and staff studies by the 
Committee which were underway during the 104th Congress

                               Appendix A

             BACKGROUND OF THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS

    On March 2, 1865, the House of Representatives separated 
the appropriating and banking and currency duties from the 
Committee on Ways and Means, which was first established in 
1789, and assigned them to two new committees--the Committee on 
Appropriations and the Committee on Banking and Currency.
    Until 1865, all ``general'' appropriations bills had been 
controlled in the House by the Committee on Ways and Means--
also in charge of revenue measures and some other classes of 
substantive legislation.

                      Membership of the Committee

    The new Committee on Appropriations--six Republicans and 
three Democrats--was appointed on December 11, 1865, in the 1st 
session of the 39th Congress, and first reported the general 
appropriations bills for the fiscal year 1867. By 1920, the 
number of members had grown to 21. It was changed that year to 
35 and gradually increased to 50 by 1951, and now numbers 58 
members with 33 Republicans and 25 Democrats.

                           Committee Chairmen

    Twenty-eight men, including the present incumbent, the 
Honorable Bob Livingston of Louisiana, have served as chairman 
of the Committee on Appropriations. The Honorable Clarence 
Cannon of Missouri, served as chairman nearly 19 years, 
although his term as chairman was of broken continuity. The 
Honorable George Mahon of Texas, served as chairman 
continuously longer than any other person, from May 18, 1964 to 
January 3, 1979. Several chairmen went on to higher or other 
important offices. One, James Garfield of Ohio, became 
President. Three, Samuel Randall of Pennsylvania, Joseph Cannon 
of Illinois, and Joseph Byrns of Tennessee, became Speaker of 
the House. Three later served in the U.S. Senate. One became 
Governor of his State. The list of distinctions is long. 
Interesting biographical sketches of 21 of the men are 
contained in House Document No. 299 of the 77th Congress.

                       The Growth of Expenditures

    In the early years of the Congress, a single general 
appropriation bill from the Ways and Means Committee met the 
needs of the country. The first bill, in 1789, appropriated 
$639,000 and covered 13 lines of the printed statutes. Five 
years later, in 1794, the Army was supplied in a separate bill, 
then the Navy in 1799. This trend continued until in 1865, 
there were 10 bills passed over to the new Committee on 
Appropriations, not including deficiency bills. For fiscal year 
1997, 13 appropriations bills have provided a total of $794.9 
billion.
    Until recent years, large sustained spending increases of 
the Federal Government usually occurred only in connection with 
wars. For several years prior to the Civil War, Federal 
expenditures averaged $60,000,000 annually. By the peak of the 
war, in fiscal year 1865, expenditures amounted to 
$1,297,555,224. The year following the war--fiscal year 1866--
spending was reduced to $520,809,417.
    In the first year for which the new Committee on 
Appropriations reported the general bills, fiscal year 1867, 
total expenditures of the Government were $357,542,675. In the 
ensuing 100 years the lowest expenditure level was 
$236,964,327--in fiscal year 1878. The Spanish-American War 
period marked the high point for the remainder of the century; 
in fiscal year 1899 expenditures reached $605,072,179, but by 
1902 had dropped back to $485,234,249. With the onset of World 
War I expenditures again crossed the billion-dollar mark in 
fiscal year 1917, reached a war peak of $18,514,879,955 in 
fiscal year 1919, and receded by fiscal year 1927 to 
$2,974,029,674, the lowest subsequent level.
    By 1940, spending in appropriations bills had climbed to 
$14.6 billion as a result mainly of various New Deal 
legislation--when we began meeting local problems with national 
programs. Since 1934, our national wealth has increased 41 
times.
    By 1943, the fiscal high point of World War II--some $143.8 
billion was being spent. After World War II spending declined 
to the $30 billion range and then increased to $91.1 billion in 
1951 in connection with the Korean War.
    After the Korean War, Federal spending in appropriations 
bills decreased to $47.6 billion in 1954. This is the last 
period in the Federal budget in which spending has decreased. 
Every year after 1954 spending has steadily increased in order 
to help meet the needs facing the country.

                           The Budget Process

    By the early 1970's new forces were at work calling for 
changes in the way in which Congress handled the budget and 
appropriations process.
    One of the most compelling of these forces, although it was 
largely a temporary problem, was due to the ``impoundment'' of 
funds in fiscal year 1974 by the President. This was, in 
effect, a line item veto of funds for programs that were 
initiated or increased by the Congress. Many Members of 
Congress and certain special interest groups were outraged and 
extremely frustrated by the impoundments. Numerous court suits 
on various impoundments had been filed and were in the process 
of being heard.
    A more serious reason for budget reform was due to the 
widely held belief that the budget was out of control. Deficits 
were mounting; so-called ``uncontrollable'' spending was 
climbing; and ``back door'' spending, i.e. spending provided 
other than through the Appropriations Committee, was 
increasing. It was also becoming clear that there was little, 
if any coordination between raising and spending revenues.
    Additionally, there was a feeling among some Members of 
Congress that there needed to be other or additional ways to 
change the priorities of Federal spending. Because of these and 
other concerns, formal work was begun on improving the 
congressional budget process through the establishment of the 
Joint Study Committee on Budget Control.
    The work of this Committee, the House Rules Committee, the 
Senate Committee on Government Operations, and the Senate Rules 
Committee eventually resulted in the adoption of the 
Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

        Budget; and
            (ii) the fiscal, financial, and economic 
        assumptions used as bases in arriving at total

determines by roll call vote that the testimony to be taken at 
that hearing on that day may be related to a matter of national

required for the fiscal year involved if such bill or 
resolution is enacted as so reported exceeds the appropriate 
allocation of new budget authority reported as described in 
clause 4 (h) in connection with the most recently agreed to 
concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year, such 
bill or resolution shall then be referred to the Committee on 
Appropriations with instructions to report it, with the

further consideration of the bill or resolution and the bill or 
resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.
    (3) In addition, the Committee on Appropriations shall 
study on a continuing basis those provisions of law which (on 
the first day of the first fiscal year for which the 
congressional budget process is effective) provide spending

                            COMMITTEE RULES

          (Adopted for the 104th Congress on January 10, 1995)
         (Revised for the 104th Congress on February 10, 1995)

    Resolved, That the rules and practices of the Committee on 
Appropriations, House of Representatives, in the One Hundred 
Third Congress, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, shall 
be and are hereby adopted as the rules and practices of the 
Committee on Appropriations in the One Hundred Fourth Congress.

    The foregoing resolution adopts the following rules:

Sec. 1: Power to Sit and Act

    For the purpose of carrying out any of its functions and 
duties under Rules X and XI of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives, the Committee or any of its subcommittees is 
authorized:
            (a) To sit and act at such times and places within 
        the United States whether the House is in session, has 
        recessed, or has adjourned, and to hold such hearings; 
        and
            (b) To require, by subpoena or otherwise, the 
        attendance and testimony of such witnesses and the 
        production of such books, reports, correspondence, 
        memorandums, papers, and documents as it deems 
        necessary. The Chairman, or any Member designated by 
        the Chairman, may administer oaths to any witness.
            (c) A subpoena may be authorized and issued by the 
        Committee or its subcommittees under subsection 1 (b) 
        in the conduct of any investigation or activity or 
        series of investigations or activities, only when 
        authorized by a majority of the Members of the 
        Committee voting, a majority being present. The power 
        to authorize and issue subpoenas under subsection 1 (b) 
        may be delegated to the Chairman pursuant to such rules 
        and under such limitations as the Committee may 
        prescribe. Authorized subpoenas shall be signed by the 
        Chairman or by any Member designated by the Committee.
            (d) Compliance with any subpoena issued by the 
        Committee or its subcommittees may be enforced only as 
        authorized or directed by the House.

Sec. 2: Subcommittees

    (a) The Majority Caucus of the Committee shall establish 
the number of subcommittees and shall determine the 
jurisdiction of each subcommittee.
    (b) Each subcommittee is authorized to meet, hold hearings, 
receive evidence, and report to the Committee all matters 
referred to it.
    (c) All legislation and other matters referred to the 
Committee shall be referred to the subcommittee of appropriate 
jurisdiction within two weeks unless, by majority vote of the 
Majority Members of the full Committee, consideration is to be 
by the full Committee.
    (d) The Majority Caucus of the Committee shall determine an 
appropriate ratio of Majority to Minority Members for each 
subcommittee. The Chairman is authorized to negotiate that 
ratio with the Minority; Provided, however, That party 
representation in each subcommittee, including ex-officio 
members, shall be no less favorable to the Majority than the 
ratio for the full Committee.
    (e) The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the full 
Committee are authorized to sit as a member of all 
subcommittees and to participate, including voting, in all its 
work.

Sec. 3: Staffing

    (a) Committee Staff--The Chairman is authorized to appoint 
the staff of the Committee, and make adjustments in the job 
titles and compensation thereof subject to the maximum rates 
and conditions established in Clause 6 (c) of Rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives. In addition, he is 
authorized, in his discretion, to arrange for their specialized 
training. The Chairman is also authorized to employ additional 
personnel as necessary.
    (b) Assistants to Members--Each of the top twenty-one 
senior majority and minority Members of the full Committee may 
select and designate one staff member who shall serve at the 
pleasure of that Member. Such staff members shall be 
compensated at a rate, determined by the Member, not to exceed 
75 per centum of the maximum established in Clause 6 (c) of 
Rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives; Provided, 
That Members designating staff members under this subsection 
must specifically certify by letter to the Chairman that the 
employees are needed and will be utilized for Committee work.

Sec. 4: Committee Meetings

    (a) Regular Meeting Day--The regular meeting day of the 
Committee shall be the first Wednesday of each month while the 
House is in session, unless the Committee has met within the 
past 30 days or the Chairman considers a specific meeting 
unnecessary in the light of the requirements of the Committee 
business schedule.
    (b) Additional and Special Meetings:
            (1) The Chairman may call and convene, as he 
        considers necessary, additional meetings of the 
        Committee for the consideration of any bill or 
        resolution pending before the Committee or for the 
        conduct of other Committee business. The Committee 
        shall meet for such purpose pursuant to that call of 
        the Chairman.
            (2) If at least three Committee Members desire that 
        a special meeting of the Committee be called by the 
        Chairman, those Members may file in the Committee 
        Offices a written request to the Chairman for that 
        special meeting. Such request shall specify the measure 
        or matter to be considered. Upon the filing of the 
        request, the Committee Clerk shall notify the Chairman.
            (3) If within three calendar days after the filing 
        of the request, the Chairman does not call the 
        requested special meeting to be held within seven 
        calendar days after the filing of the request, a 
        majority of the Committee Members may file in the 
        Committee Offices their written notice that a special 
        meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour of 
        such meeting, and the measure or matter to be 
        considered. The Committee shall meet on that date and 
        hour.
            (4) Immediately upon the filing of the notice, the 
        Committee Clerk shall notify all Committee Members that 
        such special meeting will be held and inform them of 
        its date and hour and the measure or matter to be 
        considered. Only the measure or matter specified in 
        that notice may be considered at the special meeting.
    (c) Vice Chairman To Preside in Absence of Chairman--A 
member of the majority party on the Committee or subcommittee

the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 and Clause 4 (a)(1) 
of Rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives shall be 
conducted in open session except when the Committee in open 
session and with a majority present, determines by roll call 
vote that the testimony to be taken at that hearing on that day 
may be related to a matter of national security; except that 
the Committee may by the same procedure close one subsequent 
day of hearing. A transcript of all such hearings shall be 
printed and a copy furnished to each Member, Delegate, and the 
Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico.
    (b) Other Hearings:
            (1) All other hearings conducted by the Committee

        with a majority present determines by roll call vote 
        that all or part of the remainder of that hearing on 
        that day shall be closed to the public because 
        disclosure of testimony, evidence, or other matters to 
        be considered would endanger the national security or 
        would violate any law or Rule of the House of 
        Representatives. Notwithstanding the requirements of 
        the preceding sentence, a majority of those present at 
        a hearing conducted by the Committee or any of its 
        subcommittees, there being in attendance the number 
        required under Section 5 (c) of these Rules to be 
        present for the purpose of taking testimony, (1) may 
        vote to close the hearing for the sole purpose of 
        discussing whether testimony or evidence to be received 
        would endanger the national security or violate Clause 
        2 (k)(5) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives or (2) may vote to close the hearing, 
        as provided in Clause 2 (k)(5) of such Rule. No Member 
        of the House of Representatives may be excluded from 
        nonparticipatory attendance at any hearing of the 
        Committee or its subcommittees unless the House of 
        Representatives shall by majority vote authorize the 
        Committee or any of its subcommittees, for purposes of 
        a particular series of hearings on a particular article 
        of legislation or on a particular subject of 
        investigation, to close its hearings to Members by the 
        same procedures designated in this subsection for 
        closing hearings to the public; Provided, however, That 
        the Committee or its subcommittees may by the same 
        procedure vote to close five subsequent days of 
        hearings.
            (2) Subcommittee chairmen shall coordinate the 
        development of schedules for meetings or hearings after 
        consultation with the Chairman and other subcommittee 
        chairmen with a view toward avoiding simultaneous 
        scheduling of Committee and subcommittee meetings or 
        hearings.
            (3) Each witness who is to appear before the 
        Committee or any of its subcommittees as the case may 
        be, insofar as is practicable, shall file in advance of 
        such appearance, a written statement of the proposed 
        testimony and shall limit the oral presentation at such 
        appearance to a brief summary, except that this 
        provision shall not apply to any witness appearing 
        before the Committee in the overall budget hearings.
    (c) Quorum for Taking Testimony--The number of Members of 
the Committee which shall constitute a quorum for taking 
testimony and receiving evidence in any hearing of the 
Committee shall be two.

        subcommittees shall be entitled, upon request to the 
        Chairman or subcommittee chairman, by a majority of 
        them before completion of any hearing, to call 
        witnesses selected by the Minority to testify with 
        respect to the matter under consideration during at 
        least one day of hearings thereon.
            (2) The Committee and its subcommittees shall 
        observe the five-minute rule during the interrogation 
        of witnesses until such time as each Member of the 
        Committee or subcommittee who so desires has had an 
        opportunity to question the witness.
    (e) Broadcasting and Photographing of Committee Meetings 
and Hearings--Whenever a hearing or meeting conducted by the 
full Committee or any of its subcommittees is open to the 
public, those proceedings shall be open to coverage by 
television, radio, and still photography, except as provided in 
paragraph (f)(2) of the Rules of the House of Representatives.

shall limit the number of television or still cameras to fewer 
than two representatives from each medium.

the House is reading an appropriation measure for amendment 
under the five-minute rule or while the Committee is in 
session.
    (g) Public Notice of Committee Hearings--The Chairman of 
the Committee shall make public announcement of the date, 
place, and subject matter of any Committee or subcommittee 
hearing at least one week before the commencement of the 
hearing. If the Chairman of the Committee or subcommittee, with 
the concurrence of the ranking minority member of the Committee 
or respective subcommittee, determines there is good cause to 
begin the hearing sooner, or if the Committee or subcommittee 
so determines by majority vote, a quorum being present for the 
transaction of business, the Chairman or subcommittee chairman 
shall make the announcement at the earliest possible date. Any 
announcement made under this subparagraph shall be promptly 
published in the Daily Digest and promptly entered into the 
Committee scheduling service of the House Information Systems.
