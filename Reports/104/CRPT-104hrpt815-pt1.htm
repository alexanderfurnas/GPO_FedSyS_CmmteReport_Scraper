      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

  The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, to whom 
was referred the bill (H.R. 3217) to provide for ballast water 
management to prevent the introduction and spread of 
nonindigenous species into the waters of the United States, and 
for other purposes, having considered the same, report 
favorably thereon with an amendment and recommend that the bill 
as amended do pass.
  The amendment is as follows:
  Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu 
thereof the following:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.

  (a) In General.--This Act may be cited as the ``National Invasive 
Species Act of 1996''.
  (b) References.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is 
expressed in terms of an amendment to or repeal of a section or other 
provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or 
other provision of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and 
Control Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 4701 et seq.).

SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE NONINDIGENOUS AQUATIC NUISANCE PREVENTION AND 
                    CONTROL ACT OF 1990.

  (a) Findings; Definitions.--
          (1) Findings.--Section 1002(a) (16 U.S.C. 4701(a)) is 
        amended--
                  (A) by striking paragraphs (2) and (3) and inserting 
                the following new paragraphs:
          ``(2) when environmental conditions are favorable, 
        nonindigenous species become established and may disrupt the 
        aquatic environment and economy of affected nearshore areas;
          ``(3) the zebra mussel was unintentionally introduced into 
        the Great Lakes and has infested--
                  ``(A) waters south of the Great Lakes, into a good 
                portion of the Mississippi River drainage;
                  ``(B) waters west of the Great Lakes, into the 
                Arkansas River in Oklahoma; and
                  ``(C) waters east of the Great Lakes, into the Hudson 
                River and Lake Champlain;'';

                        ruffe, round goby, and other nonindigenous 
                        species'' after ``other species''; and
                          (ii) by striking ``and'' at the end;
                  (C) in paragraph (5), by striking the period and

                  (D) by adding at the end the following new 
                paragraphs:
          ``(6) in 1992, the zebra mussel was discovered at the 
        northernmost reaches of the Chesapeake Bay watershed;
          ``(7) the zebra mussel poses an imminent risk of invasion in 
        the main waters of the Chesapeake Bay;
          ``(8) since the Chesapeake Bay is the largest recipient of 
        foreign ballast water on the East Coast, there is a risk of 
        further invasions of other nonindigenous species;
          ``(9) the zebra mussel is only one example of thousands of 
        nonindigenous species that have become established in waters of 
        the United States and may be causing economic and ecological 
        degradation with respect to the natural resources of waters of 
        the United States;
          ``(10) since their introduction in the early 1980's in 
        ballast water discharges, ruffe--
                  ``(A) have caused severe declines in populations of 
                other species of fish in Duluth Harbor (in Minnesota 
                and Wisconsin);
                  ``(B) have spread to Lake Huron; and
                  ``(C) are likely to spread quickly to most other 
                waters in North America if action is not taken promptly 
                to control their spread;
          ``(11) examples of nonindigenous species that, as of the date 
        of enactment of the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, 
        infest coastal waters of the United States and that have the 
        potential for causing adverse economic and ecological effects 
        include--
                  ``(A) the mitten crab (Eriochei sinensis) that has 
                become established on the Pacific Coast;
                  ``(B) the green crab (Carcinus maenus) that has 
                become established in the coastal waters of the 
                Atlantic Ocean;

                established along the Gulf of Mexico; and
                  ``(D) certain shellfish pathogens;
          ``(12) many aquatic nuisance vegetation species, such as 
        Eurasian watermilfoil, hydrilla, water hyacinth, and water 
        chestnut, have been introduced to waters of the United States 
        from other parts of the world causing or having a potential to 
        cause adverse environmental, ecological, and economic effects;
          ``(13) if preventive management measures are not taken 
        nationwide to prevent and control of unintentionally introduced 
        nonindigenous aquatic species in a timely manner, further 
        introductions and infestations of species that are as 
        destructive as, or more destructive than, the zebra mussel or 
        the ruffe infestations may occur;
          ``(14) once introduced into waters of the United States, 
        aquatic nuisance species are unintentionally transported and 
        introduced into inland lakes and rivers by recreational 
        boaters, commercial barge traffic, and a variety of other 
        pathways; and
          ``(15) resolving the problems associated with aquatic 
        nuisance species will require the participation and cooperation 
        of, among others, the Federal Government and State governments, 
        and investment in the development of prevention 
        technologies.''.
          (2) Definitions.--Section 1003 (16 U.S.C. 4702) is amended--
                  (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``the Committee on 
                Public Works and Transportation and the Committee on 
                Merchant Marine and Fisheries'' and inserting ``the

SEC. 3. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.

  Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act is intended to 
affect the authorities and responsibilities of the Great Lakes Fishery 
Commission established under article II of the Convention on Great 
Lakes Fisheries between the United States of America and Canada, signed 
at Washington on September 10, 1954 (hereafter in this section referred 
to as the ``Convention''), including the authorities and 
responsibilities of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission--
          (1) for developing and implementing a comprehensive program 
        for eradicating or minimizing populations of sea lamprey in the 
        Great Lakes watershed; and
          (2) carrying out the duties of the Commission specified in 
        the Convention (including any amendment thereto) and the Great 
        Lakes Fishery Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 931 et seq.).

                          Purpose and Summary

    The purpose of H.R. 3217, the National Invasive Species Act 
of 1996 (NISA), is to reauthorize and amend the Nonaquatic 
Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (NANPCA) to 
strengthen and improve the nation's response to threats posed 
by aquatic nuisance species. The legislation provides for, 
among other things, ballast water management and other measures 
to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species into 
waters of the United States.

                          Need for Legislation

    In the 1980's, there was growing concern about 
nonindigenous species (particularly zebra mussels and the 
Eurasian ruffe) in the Great Lakes and other water bodies. 
Nonindigenous nuisance species, also referred to as invasive or 
exotic species, are those plants, fish, animals, and associated 
invertebrates that have moved, either intentionally or 
unintentionally, beyond their native ranges, usually with 
humans as the primary agents of dispersal. Introduced by 
ballast water or other means, these nonnative species can 
adversely affect, among other things, valuable fisheries, water 
infrastructure and related facilities and the overall 
ecological balance in affected areas.
    In response to these concerns, Congress enacted NANPCA to 
establish a program for preventing, researching, monitoring and 
controlling infestations of nonindigenous aquatic species in 
the Great Lakes. NANPCA set up a multi-agency task force (the 
Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force) to develop and oversee the 
program. NANPCA also initiated a policy review of the effects 
of intentional introductions of nonindigenous species (such as 
for sport fishing or biological pest control), a zebra mussel 
demonstration project, and state aquatic nuisance management 
planning. It created the Great Lakes Aquatic Nuisance Species 
Panel to help coordinate federal, state, local and private 
efforts concerning nonindigenous species within the Great Lakes 
basin.
    Perhaps most importantly, NANPCA directed the Coast Guard 
to issue voluntary guidelines for the Great Lakes and, after 
two years, promulgate regulations (applicable to the Great 
Lakes) to help reduce the probability of new introductions of 
nonindigenous species by commercial vessels, whose ballast 
water is a leading pathway for nonindigenous aquatic species 
into U.S. waters. The zebra mussel and the ruffe, along with 
the spiny water flea and many of the other nonindigenous 
organisms that have been introduced into the Great Lakes 
ecosystem, were transported to the Great Lakes in the ballast 
tanks of transoceanic vessels. Red tide and the edible brown 
mussel (Perna perna) are examples of ballast stowaways that 
have been discharged into U.S. marine coastal environments.
    Six years after its passage, there is need to reauthorize 
and reform NANPCA to address waters beyond the Great Lakes and 
threats of additional exotic species through nationwide 
preventive management measures. The zebra mussel alone has been 
estimated to cost several billion dollars in repairs and 
removals related to the clogging of water supply intakes. The 
zebra mussel has also established itself in many of the 
freshwater systems of the eastern United States, including the 
upper Mississippi River, where it has degraded an economically 
valuable commercial mollusk fishery. Similarly, there is 
growing awareness of the threat of nonindigenous species to 
marine coastal areas, including estuaries such as the 
Chesapeake Bay, the San Francisco Bay and Delta, and the Gulf 
of Mexico. For example, Perna perna (a type of mussel) invaded 
South America via ballast discharge years ago and was recently 
transported to the Gulf of Mexico near Galveston, Texas.
    Compliance by the Great Lakes shipping industry with NANPCA 
has been high. At the March 22, 1996, National Forum on 
Nonindigenous Species Invasions in U.S. and Marine Fresh Waters 
sponsored by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, the United States 
Coast Guard reported that there were only 4 known cases of 
noncompliance in 1995, all due to a misunderstanding of the 
regulations. Based on this positive record of compliance, NISA 
takes the approach of first relying on a voluntary program of 
ballast water exchange and management practices to reduce the 
probability of the introduction of nonindigenous species from 
ships operating in waters of the United States. Under NISA, the 
voluntary program does not become mandatory unless the 
Secretary of Transportation determines that the rate of 
voluntary compliance with the guidelines is not adequate or if 
the Secretary is unable to adequately assess compliance due to 
inadequacies in voluntary reporting.
    As with NANPCA, the primary focus of NISA is on ballast 
water exchange as a means of control of the introduction and 
spread of aquatic nuisance species, primarily due to the lack 
of other proven prevention and control methods. To address 
other vectors for introduction and spread, the bill authorizes 
funding for research and demonstration projects in these areas.

    Discussion of Committee Bill (H.R. 3217) and Section-by-Section 
                                Analysis

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.

    Section 1 of the bill provides that the Act may be cited as 
the ``National Invasive Species Act of 1996'' and notes that 
references to section numbers therein are to the 
``Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 
1990.''

SECTION 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE NONINDIGENOUS AQUATIC NUISANCE PREVENTION 
                    AND CONTROL ACT OF 1990.

    (a) Findings; Definitions.--Subsection (a) adds additional 
findings to section 1002(a) of NANPCA to reflect the fact that 
NISA broadens the scope of current law and applies to all the 
waters of the United States, not just the Great Lakes, and to 
reflect that NISA, like NANPCA, is intended to address many 
invasive species, including both aquatic nuisance plants and a 
range of animals in addition to the zebra mussel.
    Subsection (a) also amends the definitions in section 1003 
of NANPCA to correct certain references and add definitions for 
``Great Lakes region,'' ``Indian tribe,'' and ``interstate 
organization.''
    (b) Aquatic Nuisance Species Control Program.--Subsection 
(b) restates and amends section 1101 of NANPCA. Under current 
law, section 1101 sets up the program for ballast water 
exchange by vessels that enter a United States port on the 
Great Lakes after operating beyond the exclusive economic zone. 
This program began with voluntary guidelines in 1991 and 
automatically became mandatory regulations in November 1992.
    NISA amends section 1101(b)(2) of NANPCA to remove any 
uncertainty regarding the applicability of the current Great 
Lakes regulations to all vessels equipped with ballast water 
tanks, regardless of whether they are currently carrying 
ballast or the amount of ballast in their tanks. NISA also 
authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (``Secretary'') to 
carry out further educational and technical assistance programs 
to further continued compliance with the Great Lakes program 
for ballast water exchange.
    To address the introduction and spread of nonindigenous 
species to waters of the United States beyond the Great Lakes, 
NISA adds new subsections (c), (d), and (e) to section 1101 of 
NANPCA.
    New section 1101(c) requires the Secretary to issue 
voluntary national guidelines to prevent the introduction and 
spread of nonindigenous species in waters of the United States 
by ballast water operations and other operations of vessels 
equipped with ballast water tanks. The Committee expects the 
Secretary to consult with the Task Force and regional panels 
under this Act in developing these guidelines. These guidelines 
must direct vessels carrying ballast water after operating 
beyond the exclusive economic zone to carry out ballast water 
exchange or another ballast water management method that is 
environmentally sound and determined by the Secretary to be at 
least as effective as ballast water exchange in preventing and 
controlling infestations of aquatic nuisance species. The 
Committee notes that passenger vessel ship design and stability 
considerations make it unsafe for these vessels to exchange 
ballast water at sea. The water treatment systems employed by 
certain passenger vessels use sodium hyprochlorate solutions or 
metal electrolytic cathodes to kill both adult and larva stages 
of undesirable organisms. This treatment process prevents the 
growth of organisms in the internal water distribution system 
of the vessel, and prevents the growth or organisms that may 
otherwise be discharged with ballast water into U.S. waters. 
The Committee expects the Secretary will determine that such 
ballast water treatment systems in passenger cruise ships are 
environmentally sound and as effective as ballast water 
exchange.
    The guidelines also must include management practices to 
reduce the probability of unintentional introductions from ship 
operations other than ballast discharge and must provide for 
record keeping and sampling procedures to allow the Secretary 
to determine compliance with the guidelines. These guidelines 
also must, among other things, protect the safety of each 
vessel and the crew and passengers of each vessel--as 
determined by the master of the vessel--and must take into 
account geographic and ecological variations and different 
operating conditions. The Committee intends that the guidelines 
clearly except a vessel from the requirement to exchange 
ballast water at sea when the master of a vessel believes it is 
unsafe to do so. Under existing ballast water exchange 
regulations for the Great Lakes, the master of any vessel 
subject to the ballast water exchange requirement is not 
required to exchange ballast water before entering the U.S. 
Exclusive Economic Zone, if it would be unsafe due to weather, 
equipment failure, ship architecture, or other extraordinary 
conditions. The Committee intends that the voluntary national 
guidelines include these exceptions for ballast water exchange. 
The guidelines may not supersede or affect any Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) requirements. The 
Secretary is also directed to carry out education and technical 
assistance programs to encourage compliance with the voluntary 
guidelines.
    New sections 1101 (d) and (e) set up a procedure for the 
periodic review and revision of both the voluntary national 
guidelines and any regulations issued under the Act.
    With respect to the new voluntary national guidelines, this 
section requires the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force to 
develop criteria for determining the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the voluntary guidelines and submit them to the Secretary 
within 18 months of enactment. These criteria will be applied 
by the Secretary in assessing compliance with and effectiveness 
of the guidelines. The Secretary must, not later than three 
years after enactment of NISA, and at least every three years 
thereafter, assess the rate of compliance with and the 
effectiveness of the voluntary national guidelines in reducing 
the introduction and spread of invasive species by vessels. In 
addition, under this section the Task Force is authorized to 
request the Secretary to conduct a special review and revision 
for specified waterways.
    If, based on a review, the Secretary determines that the 
voluntary national guidelines are not sufficiently effective 
and revision is necessary, the Secretary must revise the 
guidelines, after providing notice and an opportunity for 
comment. If, based on a review, the Secretary determines that 
the rate of compliance by vessels with the voluntary national 
guidelines is not adequate, or if the Secretary must, in 
accordance with new section 1101(e), promptly issue the 
guidelines as enforceable regulations.
    If the Secretary determines that the guidelines or a 
portion thereof are ineffective and that there is an inadequate 
rate of compliance with the ineffective guidelines, the 
Secretary should correct the problem with the voluntary 
guidelines and provide vessels with an opportunity to comply 
with effective guidelines, before turning the revised 
guidelines into enforceable regulations.
    The Committee understands that the Coast Guard is currently 
developing strategies for assessing and ensuring compliance 
with guidelines and regulations issued under this Act, 
including any new regulations that may be issued under new 
section 1101(e). The Committee expects the Coast Guard to 
timely develop a system for measuring compliance to ensure that 
necessary information is available for the reviews under 
subsection (d). The Committee recognizes that monitoring and 
ensuring compliance with a national program requires advance 
planning and may raise resource and implementation issues, and 
encourages the Coast Guard to continue this effort and consult 
with the Task Force and other interested parties. In 
prioritizing its efforts, the Coast Guard should consider 
developing a compliance monitoring strategy for the San 
Francisco Bay area which addresses saltwater to saltwater 
voyages.
    The periodic and special review procedures of new section 
1101(d) also apply to the existing regulations for the Great 
Lakes issued under section 1101(b). These regulations are 
already enforceable, but may be revised if necessary based on 
the Secretary's review of their effectiveness. These periodic 
and special review procedures also apply to any regulations 
that may be issued under subsection 1101(e).
    New section 1101(f) restates the sanctions of civil 
penalties, criminal penalties, and revocation of clearance that 
are currently applicable to violations of the Great Lakes 
regulations and expands the scope of these sanctions to include 
the new national regulations that may be issued under section 
1101(e). Also, these sanctions are consolidated in new section 
1101(f) and therefore sections 1101(b)(2)(F), (c) and (d) of 
current law are deleted.
    New sections 1101(g), (h) and (i) require coordination with 
other federal agencies, encourage consultation with foreign 
governments, and encourage international cooperation 
respectively. Any coordination with other Federal agencies that 
would require use of another agency's personnel or resources 
must, of course, be on a consensual basis. For example, the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of 
Agriculture must consent to the use of its personnel, 
facilities and other resources in coordinating with other 
agencies to help implement this Act.
    (c) National Ballast Water Management Information.--
Subsection (c) amends section 1102(b) of NANPCA to require the 
Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force and the Secretary of 
Transportation to conduct surveys of both the ecology of and 
the ballast discharge rates and practices in certain estuaries 
of national significance and other waters the Task Force 
determines to be susceptible to invasion by aquatic nuisance 
species. The term ``estuaries of national significance'' refers 
to estuaries included in the National Estuary Program under 
section 320 of the Clean Water Act.
    One purpose of these surveys is to assist the Secretary in 
making its determination of the effectiveness of and compliance 
with the voluntary national guidelines, as required by section 
1101(d). The Committee expects the Task Force and the Secretary 
to complete these surveys in a time frame that will allow the 
Secretary to consider the results as it conducts its periodic 
reviews.
    Subsection (c) also adds new section 1102(e) to authorize 
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to award grants 
for research on aquatic nuisance species prevention and 
control. This authorization totals $2.25 million a year for six 
years. During the July 17, 1996, hearing on the bill, the Water 
Resources and Environment Subcommittee and the Coast Guard and 
Maritime Transportation Subcommittee heard testimony and 
statements for Members regarding the risk invasive species pose 
to, among others, the Chesapeake Bay, the San Francisco Bay, 
the Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors, and the Gulf of Mexico. 
As introduced, NISA authorized up to $750,000 annually in 
research grants for aquatic nuisance species prevention and 
control research in the Chesapeake Bay, to be administrated by 
the Chesapeake Research Consortium. The Committee amended the 
introduced bill to respond to the concerns of other regions in 
addition to the Chesapeake Bay. As reported, NISA also 
authorizes $500,000 annually for research in the Gulf of 
Mexico, to be administered by the Louisiana Universities Marine 
Consortium, $500,000 annually for research on the Pacific 
Coast, and $500,000 annually for research on the Atlantic Coast 
(other than the Chesapeake Bay).
    Finally, subsection (c) adds new section 1102(f)(1) to the 
Act to require the Secretary of Transportation to develop and 
maintain a National Ballast Information Clearinghouse. To 
implement the existing doctrine of port state control, that 
helps ensure the safety of our harbors, waterways, and 
communities, the Coast Guard maintains a database of all 
vessels that enter and clear the United States. This system is 
called the Vessel Identification System (VID). The Committee 
believes that it will be a simple process to include in the VID 
system the ballast water exchange information required by the 
Act and will not require the investment of new resources in a 
ballast water exchange tracking system. Using this system, the 
Coast Guard will be able to review a vessel's ballast water 
exchange history before the vessel arrives in the United States 
to help them decide whether to board the vessel to test the 
water in its ballast tanks. The Committee intends the Secretary 
to consult closely with the Task Force and SERC and make use of 
the Task Force's expertise in ecological issues and SERC's 
experience with monitoring ballast water exchange in the 
Chesapeake Bay.
    New section 1102(f)(2) requires the Secretary, working 
closely with the Task Force and the Smithsonian Environmental 
Research Center, to submit to Congress a report that 
synthesizes and analyzes the data collected by the Coast Guard 
under paragraph (1). The Committee intends for the Smithsonian 
Environmental Research Center (SERC) to conduct the data 
synthesis and analysis required for this report. SERC is home 
to perhaps the largest ballast water research and invasion 
programs in the country and is uniquely qualified to provide 
expertise on ecological issues arising from biological 
invasions. The Committee intends SERC to play a key role in 
meeting a critical need for organization, analysis, 
interpretation, and distribution of the data maintained by the 
Coast Guard.
    (d) Armed Services Ballast Water Program; Ballast Water 
Management Demonstration Program.--Subsection (d) adds two new 
sections to Subtitle B of NANCPA. New section 1103 requires the 
Secretary of Defense and, for Coast Guard vessels, the 
Secretary of Transportation, to implement a ballast water 
management program for seagoing vessels to minimize the risk of 
introduction of nonindigenous species from releases of ballast 
water. The Committee is aware that, due to operational 
conditions of these vessels, it may be impossible to reduce the 
risk to zero. Thus, the requirement is to minimize the risk, 
subject to operational conditions of the vessels. The Committee 
is aware that the Department of Defense and EPA, in 
consultation with the Coast Guard, the Department of Commerce, 
and interested States, also are currently developing a program 
to control discharges incidental to the normal operation of 
Armed Forces vessels under section 312(n) of the Clean Water 
Act.
    New section 1104 requires the Secretary of Interior, with 
the concurrence of and in cooperation with the Secretary of 
Transportation, to conduct a ballast water management 
demonstration program to demonstrate technologies and practices 
to prevent aquatic nuisance species from being introduced into 
and spread through the Great Lakes and other waters of the U.S. 
through ballast water. Development of technologies and 
practices other than ballast water exchange is essential, 
particularly to prevent further spread of invasive species that 
already have been introduced into the Great Lakes or other 
waters of the U.S. The Committee intends this demonstration 
program to be a cooperative effort. The Committee expects the 
Secretary of Transportation, acting through the Coast Guard, to 
bring its expertise in vessel operations to this demonstration 
program. The Committee expects the Secretary of Interior, 
acting through the Fish and Wildlife Service, to bring its 
expertise with respect to aquatic nuisance species to this 
demonstration program.
    (e) Amendments to Subtitle C.--Subsection (e) amends 
section 1201(b) to add the Secretary of Agriculture to the 
Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force. This section also adds the 
Chesapeake Bay Program as an ex officio member of the Task 
Force in section 1201(c). The Committee notes that the 
Chesapeake Bay Program, as well as the Lake Champlain Basin 
Program that was added to the Task Force in Public Law 104-182, 
are programs within EPA to address water quality concerns in 
these waters pursuant to its authority under the Clean Water 
Act and other authorizing legislation. Under such authorizing 
legislation, EPA has sponsored these programs that include both 
governmental entities and partners from the private sector. 
While nongovernmental parties may and should lend their 
expertise to the Task Force, they should not be accorded the 
same status as the governmental entities that serve as official 
and ex officio members of the Task Force.
    Subsection (e) amends the existing zebra mussel 
demonstration program in section 1202(i)(1) to require the Army 
Corps of Engineers to develop a demonstration program for the 
control of zebra mussels around public facilities. NISA also 
amends section 1202(i)(1) to require the Task Force to develop 
voluntary guidelines for controlling the spread of zebra 
mussels and, if appropriate, other aquatic nuisance species, 
through recreational activities. In determining whether it is 
appropriate to address other aquatic nuisance species, the Task 
Force should consider whether recreational activities are a 
likely vector for the spread, the potential impacts of such 
spread should it occur, whether effective control methods 
exist, and the cost of compliance with the control methods. The 
Task Force must develop these guidelines and submit them to the 
Secretary within one year of enactment. Within four months 
after receipt of the guidelines from the Task Force, the 
Secretary must provide an opportunity for notice and comment on 
the Task Force guidelines and issue voluntary guidelines that 
are based on the Task Force guidelines. The Secretary has the 
discretion to revise the voluntary guidelines received from the 
Task Force before issuing them, based on the comments received 
during the public comment period.
    Subsection (e) also adds four new paragraphs to section 
1202(i). New Paragraph (2) authorizes research grants for 
projects that identify methods for controlling dispersal of 
aquatic nuisance species, to be administered by EPA, in 
cooperation with the National Science Foundation and the Task 
Force and authorizes the appropriation of $500,000 to EPA for 
such research grants. New paragraph (3) requires the Army Corps 
of Engineers to conduct and report on a study of the Chicago 
River Ship and Sanitary Canal to investigate methods for 
preventing aquatic nuisance species dispersal and authorizes 
the appropriation of $750,000 to the Army Corps of Engineers to 
conduct the study. New paragraph (4) authorizes EPA and the 
Army to enter into cost-sharing agreements with interested 
parties in carrying out the grant program or the Chicago River 
study. New paragraph (5) requires the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration to provide technical assistance to 
the Lake Champlain Research Consortium to assist the research 
conducted by the Consortium pursuant to this subsection.
    Subsection (e) amends section 1203 of the Act to authorize 
additional regional panels to coordinate governmental and 
private efforts to prevent and control aquatic nuisance 
species. The bill directs the Task Force to, within 30 days of 
enactment, request a Western Regional Panel to perform 
activities specified in the bill to identify and address 
threats and prevent the spread of invasive species throughout 
the West. The Committee understands that a Western Zebra Mussel 
Task Force already exists. The Aquatic Nuisance Task Force may 
direct its request to this existing organization, rather than 
convening a new Western Region Panel. The bill also directs the 
Task Force to encourage the development of other regional 
panels.
    Subsection (e) amends section 1204 of the Act to broaden 
the existing authorization for the development of state aquatic 
nuisance species management plans to add interstate 
organizations (including Indian tribes) and to authorize the 
Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration to assist states or Indian tribes, 
at their request, in the enforcement of a state or interstate 
aquatic nuisance species management plan. Provisions on 
enforcement assistance are not to be construed as broadening 
existing enforcement authorities of the Fish and Wildlife 
Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--NISA authorizes the 
appropriation of $2 million to the Secretary of Transportation 
for 1997 and 1998, and $3 million for 1999 through 2002, 
totaling $16 million, to prevent unintentional introductions of

section 1102(f).
    NISA authorizes the appropriation of $6 million for each of 
fiscal years 1997 through 2002, totaling $36 million, to the 
Department of the Interior to be used by the Fish and Wildlife 
Service to carry out its responsibilities in implementing the 
aquatic nuisance species program in section 1202 and the Brown 
Tree Snake Control Program in section 1209.
    NISA authorizes the appropriation of $1 million for each of 
fiscal years 1997 through 2002, totaling $6 million, to the 
Department of Commerce to be used by the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration to carry out its responsibilities in 
implementing the aquatic nuisance species program in section 
1202.
    NISA authorizes the appropriation of $1.625 million for 
each of fiscal years 1997 through 2002, totaling $9.75 million, 
to fund aquatic nuisance species control research under section 
1202(i). $500,000 of this annual authorization is to go the 
Lake Champlain Research Consortium and the remainder is to go 
to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Great 
Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory.
    NISA authorizes the appropriation of $5 million for each of 
fiscal years 1997 through 2002, totaling $30 million, for 
grants for research on aquatic nuisance species under section 
1202(f)(3). $4 million of this annual authorization is for 
grants administered through the National Sea Grant College 
Program and for grants to land grant colleges. $1 million of 
this annual authorization is for grants administered through 
the Cooperative Fisheries and Wildlife Research Unit of the 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
    NISA authorizes the appropriation of $3 million for each of 
fiscal years 1997 through 2002, totaling $18 million, to the 
Army Corps of Engineers for research on and development and 
demonstration of environmentally sound methods of control of 
zebra mussels in and around public facilities under section 
1202(i)(1)(B).
    NISA authorizes the appropriation of $300,000 for each of 
fiscal years 1997 through 2002, totaling $1.8 million, to fund 
regional panels under section 1203, of which $100,000 annually 
is to be to the Great Lakes Commission.
    NISA authorizes the appropriation of $4 million for each of 
fiscal years 1997 through 2002, totaling $24 million, to the 
Department of the Interior for the Fish and Wildlife Service to 
make grants with approved aquatic nuisance species management 
plans under section 1204, of which $1.5 million annually shall 
be used for grants to states with approved aquatic nuisance 
species management plans for management of aquatic nuisance 
vegetable species.
    NISA authorizes the appropriation of $2.5 million to the 
Department of the Interior to conduct the ballast water 
management demonstration program required by section 1104.
    (g) Technical Corrections.--This section makes technical 
corrections to the Act to remove beginning and closing 
quotation marks that were inadvertently codified in Public Law 
101-646.

SECTION 3. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.

    Section 3 clarifies the Committee's intent that NISA not 
affect the authorities and responsibilities of the Great Lakes 
Fishery Commission.

               Hearings and Previous Legislative Activity

    H.R. 3217, the National Invasive Species Act of 1996, was 
introduced by Congressman Steven LaTourette alone with eighteen 
cosponsors on March 29, 1996. The bill was referred primarily 
to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and in 
addition, to the Committee on Resources.
    On July 17, 1996, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and 
Environment and the Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and 
Maritime Transportation held a hearing on H.R. 3217. The 
Subcommittees heard testimony from eleven witnesses including 
representatives of the United States Coast Guard, the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, 
the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Chesapeake 
Bay Commission, state and local agencies, and the maritime 
industry. All of the witnesses supported the intent, 
objectives, and basic provisions of the bill.

                        Committee Consideration

    Clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI requires each committee report 
to include the total number of votes cast for and against on 
each rollcall vote on a motion to report and on any amendment 
offered to the measure or matter, and the names of those 
members voting for and against. The Committee considered the 
bill and an amendment in the nature of a substitute and 
favorably reported it, as amended, by a voice vote.

                      Committee Oversight Findings

    Clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI requires each committee report 
to contain oversight findings and recommendations required 
pursuant to clause 2(b)(1) of rule X. The Committee has no 
specific oversight findings.

 Oversight Findings and Recommendations of the Committee on Government 
                          Reform and Oversight

    Clause 2(l)(3)(D) of rule XI requires each committee report 
to contain a summary of the oversight findings and 
recommendations made by the Government Reform and Oversight 
Committee pursuant to clause 4(c)(2) of rule X, whenever such 
findings have been timely submitted. The Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure has received no findings and 
recommendations from the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight.

                        Committee Cost Estimate

    Clause 2(l)(3)(B) of rule XI requires each committee report 
that accompanies a measure providing new budget authority, new 
spending authority, or new credit authority or changing 
revenues or tax expenditures to contain a cost estimate, as 
required by section 308(a)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act 
of 1974 and, when practicable with respect to estimates of new 
budget authority, a comparison of the total estimated funding 
levels for the relevant program (or programs) to the 
appropriate levels under current law.
    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII requires committees to include 
their own cost estimates in certain committee reports, which 
include, where practicable, a comparison of the total estimated 
funding level for the relevant program (or programs) with the 
appropriate levels under current law.
    The Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate prepared 
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, pursuant to 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1994.

                 Congressional Budget Office Estimates

    Clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI requires each committee report 
to include a cost estimate prepared by the Director of the 
Congressional Budget Office, pursuant to section 403 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, if the cost estimate is 
timely submitted. The following is the Congressional Budget 
Office cost estimate:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 19, 1996.
Hon. Bud Shuster,
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3217, the National 
Invasive Species Act of 1996.
    Enacting H.R. 3217 could affect direct spending and 
receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to 
the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.
    Enclosure.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: H.R. 3217.
    2. Bill title: National Invasive Species Act of 1996.
    3. Bill Status: As ordered reported by the House Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure on September 12, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: H.R. 3217 would amend the Nonindigenous 
Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990, which 
addresses environmental problems caused by the introduction and 
spread of certain aquatic species such as the zebra mussel into 
the Great Lakes and other U.S. waters. The bill would: (1) 
reauthorize ongoing regulatory and research activities carried 
out by the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force, the Army Corps 
of Engineers, and the Departments of Transportation, Commerce, 
and the Interior, (2) expand federal regulatory activities to 
encompass all U.S. waters, and (3) establish new programs, 
including:
          Educational and technical assistance programs to aid 
        vessel operators in complying with federal guidelines;
          Ecological and ballast discharge surveys of specified 
        estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay;
          Several new research grants and demonstration 
        programs;
          A national clearinghouse for ballast water 
        information; and
          New regional programs, including regional research 
        grants and regional advisory panels.
    Finally, the bill would authorize the appropriation of 
funds for both existing programs and new programs through 
fiscal year 2002.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: H.R. 3217 
would authorize appropriations totaling nearly $174 million 
over the 1997-2002 period, including between $18 million and 
$19 million annually for regulatory and research activities 
already carried out (on a more limited basis) under the 1990 
act. The bill would authorize funds totaling $64 million over 
the 1997-2002 period for new programs that would be established 
by H.R. 3217.
    In addition to providing authorizations of appropriations, 
the bill could also affect federal revenues and direct spending 
by establishing civil and criminal fines that may be imposed by 
the U.S. Coast Guard in the future. CBO estimates that revenues 
and direct spending would not be affected until 1999, however, 
and that any such changes would likely be less than $500,000 a 
year. The estimated budgetary effects of H.R. 3217 are 
summarized in the following table.

\1\ The 1996 level is the amount appropriated for programs authorized by this bill.                             
\2\ Less than $500,000.                                                                                         

    The costs of this bill fall within budget functions 300, 
400, and 500.
    6. Basis of estimate: For purposes of this estimate, CBO 
assumes that H.R. 3217 will be enacted within the next few 
weeks, and that the full amounts authorized will be 
appropriated for each fiscal year. The authorization levels for 
each fiscal year are as stated in the bill, including $3.8 
million in 1997 for one-time research and demonstration 
projects. Outlays for all programs have been estimated on the 
basis of historical patterns for similar programs.
    Section 2(b) of the bill would establish criminal and civil 
penalties for failure to comply with regulations established by 
the Coast Guard to prevent the introduction or spread of 
nonindigenous species into U.S. waters. The Coast Guard would 
promulgate such regulations only if the agency determines that 
vessel operators are not complying with voluntary guidelines or 
that such guidelines are ineffective. Based on the timetables 
established by the bill for reviewing the effect of the 
voluntary guildelines, CBO expects that no mandatory 
regulations would be imposed before fiscal year 1999. We 
estimate that, beginning in that year, the penalties 
established by section 2(b) would increase governmental 
receipts by less than $500,000 annually. Criminal fines would 
be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund and would be available 
for spending in the following year. Thus, direct spending from 
the fund would match the increase in revenues with a one-year 
lag.
    7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets 
up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct 
spending or receipts through 1998. CBO estimates that the civil 
and criminal penalties established by H.R. 3217 would affect 
spending and receipts if the Coast Guard decides to impose 
mandator national regulations for the discharge of ballast 
water. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to the 
bill. However, we estimate that any resulting increase in 
receipts from civil and criminal fines established by the bill 
and related spending of criminal fines from the Crime Victims 
Fund would not occur before fiscal year 1999. The estimated 
pay-as-you-go effect is summarized in the following table.


                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal 
governments: The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as 
defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 
104-4). It would authorize funding for states to help them 
prevent and control the spread of aquatic nuisance species.
    The bill would authorize appropriations of $4 million for 
each of fiscal years 1997 through 2002 for grants to fund state 
efforts to control aquatic nuisance species. States would be 
eligible for this funding if they develop and submit plans 
detailing how they intend to deal with nuisance species. The 
bill would also change this program to allow interstate 
organizations to submit plans and receive funding.
    The bill would also reauthorize ongoing grant programs and 
would establish several new grant programs to fund research on 
preventing and controlling aquatic nuisance species in 
different regions of the country. State universities would be 
eligible to receive this grant funding. The bill would 
authorize total appropriations of $44 million for these grants 
over fiscal years 1997 through 2002.
    9. Estimated impact on the private sector: Section 2 would 
impose new private-sector mandates for vessels equipped with 
ballast water tanks that operate in waters of the United 
States. In particular, it would maintain regulations for 
ballast exchange for vessels bound for the Great Lakes and 
would establish new requirements for ballast exchange for 
vessels bound for other U.S. waters. Based on data for 1995, 
the new mandate for ballast exchange would affect up to 48,000 
port calls. In addition, section 2 would establish new 
requirements for management practices for ship operations other 
than ballast discharge, ballasting practices of vessels that 
enter U.S. waters with no ballast on board, and recordkeeping.
    Representatives of the private sector have offered a wide 
range of opinions regarding the costs for each vessel, 
depending on the additional distance that the vessel must 
travel to exchange ballast, the additional time required to 
make the exchange, the method of exchange, the type of vessel, 
and other factors. Thus, the costs of compliance could be 
negligible for some vessels and high for others. CBO does not 
yet have enough information about current or potential future 
practices to measure the incremental costs of the mandates. 
Therefore, we cannot ascertain whether those costs would exceed 
the $100 million threshold for private-sector mandates.
    10. Previous CBO estimate. None.
    11. Estimate prepared by: Federal cost estimate--Deborah 
Reis. Impact on state, local, and tribal governments--Pepper 
Santalucia. Impact on the private sector--Victoria Greenfield.
    12. Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine, for Paul N. 
Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI requires each committee report on 
a bill or joint resolution of a public character to include an 
analytical statement describing what impact enactment of the 
measure would have on prices and costs in the operation of the 
national economy. The Committee has determined that H.R. 3217 
has no inflationary impact on the national economy.

         Changes in Existing Law Made by the Bill, as Reported

  In compliance with clause 3 of rule XIII of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the 
bill, as reported, are shown as follows (existing law proposed 
to be omitted is enclosed in black brackets, new matter is 
printed in italic, existing law in which no change is proposed 
is shown in roman):

   NONINDIGENOUS AQUATIC NUISANCE PREVENTION AND CONTROL ACT OF 1990

AN ACT To prevent and control infestations of the coastal inland waters 
   of the United States by the zebra mussel and other nonindigenous 
aquatic nuisance species, to reauthorize the National Sea Grant College 
                    Program, and for other purposes.

  Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled,

          [``]TITLE I--AQUATIC NUISANCE PREVENTION AND CONTROL

                     Subtitle A--General Provisions

[``]SECTION 1001. SHORT TITLE.

  [``]This title may be cited as the ``Nonindigenous Aquatic 
Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990''.

[``]SEC. 1002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

  [``](a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
          [``](1) the discharge of untreated water in the 
        ballast tanks of vessels and through other means 
        results in unintentional introductions of nonindigenous 
        species to fresh, brackish, and saltwater environments;

        sound control methods to prevent, monitor and control 
        unintentional introductions of nonindigenous species 
        from pathways other than ballast water exchange;
          [``](4) to understand and minimize economic and 
        ecological impacts of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance 
        species that become established, including the zebra 
        mussel; and
          [``](5) to establish a program of research and 
        technology development and assistance to States in the 
        management and removal of zebra mussels.

        Lakes and any other waters infested, or likely to 
        become infested in the near future, by the zebra 
        mussel.
  [``](c) Prevention.--
          [``](1) In general.--The Task Force shall establish 
        and implement measures, within the program developed 
        under subsection (a), to minimize the risk of 
        introduction of aquatic nuisance species to waters of 
        the United States, including--
                  [``](A) identification of pathways by which 
                aquatic organisms are introduced to waters of 
                the United States;
                  [``](B) assessment of the risk that an 
                aquatic organism carried by an identified 
                pathway may become an aquatic nuisance species; 
                and
                  [``](C) evaluation of whether measures to 
                prevent introductions of aquatic nuisance 
                species are effective and environmentally 
                sound.
          [``](2) Implementation.--Whenever the Task Force 
        determines that there is a substantial risk of 
        unintentional introduction of an aquatic nuisance 
        species by an identified pathway and that the adverse 
        consequences of such an introduction are likely to be 
        substantial, the Task Force shall, acting through the 
        appropriate Federal agency, and after an opportunity 
        for public comment, carry out cooperative, 
        environmentally sound efforts with regional, State and 
        local entities to minimize the risk of such an 
        introduction.
  [``](d) Monitoring.--The Task Force shall establish and 
implement monitoring measures, within the program developed 
under subsection (a), to--
          [``](1) detect unintentional introductions of aquatic 
        nuisance species;
          [``](2) determine the dispersal of aquatic nuisance 
        species after introduction; and
          [``](3) provide for the early detection and 
        prevention of infestations of aquatic nuisance species 
        in unaffected drainage basins.
  [``](e) Control.--
          [``](1) In general.--The Task Force may develop 
        cooperative efforts, within the program established 
        under subsection (a), to control established aquatic 
        nuisance species to minimize the risk of harm to the 
        environment and the public health and welfare. For 
        purposes of this Act, control efforts include 
        eradication of infestations, reductions of populations, 
        development of means of adapting human activities and 
        public facilities to accommodate infestations, and 
        prevention of the spread of aquatic nuisance species 
        from infested areas. Such control efforts shall be 
        developed in consultation with affected Federal 
        agencies, States, Indian Tribes, local governments, 
        interjurisdictional organizations, and other 
        appropriate entities. Control actions authorized by 
        this section shall be based on the best available 
        scientific information and shall be conducted in an 
        environmentally sound manner.
          [``](2) Decisions.--The Task Force or any other 
        affected agency or entity may recommend that the Task 
        Force initiate a control effort. In determining whether 
        a control program is warranted, the Task Force shall 
        evaluate the need for control (including the projected 
        consequences of no control and less than full control); 
        the technical and biological feasibility and cost-
        effectiveness of alternative control strategies and 
        actions; whether the benefits of control, including 
        costs avoided, exceed the costs of the program; the 
        risk of harm to non-target organisms and ecosystems, 
        public health and welfare; and such other 
        considerations the Task Force determines appropriate. 
        The Task Force shall also determine the nature and 
        extent of control of target aquatic nuisance species 
        that is feasible and desirable.
          [``](3) Programs.--If the Task Force determines in 
        accordance with paragraph (2) that control of an 
        aquatic nuisance species is warranted, the Task Force 
        shall develop a proposed control program to achieve the 
        target level of control. A notice summarizing the 
        proposed action and soliciting comments shall be 
        published in the Federal Register, in major newspapers 
        in the region affected, and in principal trade 
        publications of the industries affected. Within 180 
        days of proposing a control program, and after 
        consultation with affected governmental and other 
        appropriate entities and taking into consideration 
        other comments received, the Task Force shall complete 
        development of the proposed control program.
  [``](f) Research.--
          [``](1) Priorities.--The Task Force shall, within the 
        program developed under subsection (a), conduct 
        research concerning--
                  [``](A) the environmental and economic risks 
                and impacts associated with the introduction of 
                aquatic nuisance species into the waters of the 
                United States;
                  [``](B) the principal pathways by which 
                aquatic nuisance species are introduced and 
                dispersed;
                  [``](C) possible methods for the prevention, 
                monitoring and control of aquatic nuisance 
                species; and
                  [``](D) the assessment of the effectiveness 
                of prevention, monitoring and control methods.
          [``](2) Protocol.--Within 90 days of the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Task Force shall establish 
        and follow a protocol to ensure that research 
        activities carried out under this subtitle do not 
        result in the introduction of aquatic nuisance species 
        to waters of the United States.
          [``](3) Grants for research.--The Task Force shall 
        allocate funds authorized under this Act for 
        competitive research grants to study all aspects of 
        aquatic nuisance species, which shall be administered 
        through the National Sea Grant College Program and the 
        Cooperative Fishery and Wildlife Research Units. Grants 
        shall be conditioned to ensure that any recipient of 
        funds follows the protocol established under paragraph 
        (2) of this subsection.
  [``](g) Technical Assistance.--The Task Force shall, within 
the program developed under subsection (a), provide technical 
assistance to State and local governments and persons to 
minimize the environmental, public health, and safety risks 
associated with aquatic nuisance species, including an early 
warning system for advance notice of possible infestations and 
appropriate responses.
  [``](h) Education.--The Task Force shall, with the program 
developed under subsection (a), establish and implement 
educational programs through Sea Grant Marine Advisory Services 
and any other available resources that it determines to be 
appropriate to inform the general public, State governments, 
governments of political subdivisions of States, and industrial 
and recreational users of aquatic resources in connection with 
matters concerning the identification of aquatic nuisance 
species, and control methods for such species, including the 
prevention of the further distribution of such species.

        [``]TITLE II--GREAT LAKES FISH AND WILDLIFE RESTORATION

[``]SECTION 2001. SHORT TITLE.

  [``]This title may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Fish and 
Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990''.

[``]SEC. 2002. FINDINGS.

  [``]The Congress finds and declares the following:
          [``](1) As the human population of the Great Lakes 
        Basin has expanded to over 35,000,000 people, great 
        demands have been placed on the lakes for use for 
        boating and other recreation, navigation, municipal and 
        industrial water supply, waste disposal, power 
        production, and other purposes. These growing and often 
        conflicting demands exert pressure on the fish and 
        wildlife resources of the Great Lakes Basin, including 
        in the form of contaminants, invasion by nonindigenous 
        species, habitat degradation and destruction, legal and 
        illegal fishery resource harvest levels, and sea 
        lamprey predation.
          [``](2) The fishery resources of the Great Lakes 
        support recreational fisheries enjoyed by more than 
        5,000,000 people annually and commercial fisheries 
        providing approximately 9,000 jobs. Together, these 
        fisheries generate economic activity worth more than 
        $4,400,000,000 annually to the United States.
          [``](3) The availability of a suitable forage base is 
        essential to lake trout, walleye, yellow perch, and 
        other recreational and commercially valuable fishery 
        resources of the Great Lakes Basin. Protecting and 
        restoring productive fish habitat, including by 
        protecting water quality, is essential to the 
        successful recovery of Great Lakes Basin fishery 
        resources.
          [``](4) The Great Lakes Basin contains important 
        breeding and migration habitat for all types of 
        migratory birds. Many migratory bird species dependent 
        on deteriorating Great Lakes Basin habitat have 
        suffered serious population declines in recent years.
          [``](5) Over 80 percent of the original wetlands in 
        the Great Lakes Basin have been destroyed and such 
        losses continue at a rate of 20,000 acres annually.
          [``](6) Contaminant burdens in the fish and wildlife 
        resources of the Great Lakes Basin are substantial and 
        the impacts of those contaminants on the life functions 
        of important fish and wildlife resources are poorly 
        understood. Concern over the effects of those 
        contaminants on human health have resulted in numerous 
        public health advisories recommending restricted or no 
        consumption of Great Lakes fish.
          [``](7) The lower Great Lakes are uniquely different 
        from the upper Great Lakes biologically, physically, 
        and in the degree of human use and shoreline 
        development, and special fishery resource assessments 
        and management activities are necessary to respond 
        effectively to these special circumstances.

[``]SEC. 2003. PURPOSE.

  [``]The purposes of this Act are--
          [``](1) to carry out a comprehensive study of the 
        status, and the assessment, management, and restoration 
        needs, of the fishery resources of the Great Lakes 
        Basin;
          [``](2) to develop proposals to implement 
        recommendations resulting from that study; and
          [``](3) to provide assistance to the Great Lakes 
        Fisheries Commission, States, Indian Tribes, and other 
        interested entities to encourage cooperative 
        conservation, restoration and management of the fish 
        and wildlife resources and their habitat of the Great 
        Lakes Basin.

                                 Washington DC, September 17, 1996.
Hon. Benjamin A. Gilman,
Chairman, Committee on International Relations, Rayburn House Office 
        Building, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee ordered reported H.R. 3217 (the 
``National Invasive Species Act of 1996'') on September 12, 
1996.
    I recognize the Committee on International Relations has an 
interest in sections 1101(h) and 1101(i), which relate to 
international matters. I appreciate your decision not to seek a 
sequential referral of the bill and acknowledge this is not to 
be construed as a waiver of your Committee's jurisdiction.
    Thank you for your cooperation and that of your staff.
    With kind personal regards, I remain,
            Sincerely,
                                             Bud Shuster, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                      Committee on International Relations,
                                Washington, DC, September 17, 1996.
Hon. Bud Shuster,
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Rayburn HOB, 
        Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of September 
17, 1996, in regard to your committee's consideration of H.R. 
3217, the National Invasive Species Act.
    It is my understanding that sections 1101(h) and 1101(I) of 
the legislation, relating to consultation with Canada, Mexico 
and other foreign governments in developing appropriate 
guidelines and regulations and other aspects of international 
cooperation designed to prevent the unintentional introduction 
and spread of nonindigenous species, affect matters within the 
jurisdiction of the International Relations Committee.
    In light of your desire to move this legislation 
expeditiously, I will not seek a sequential referral of the 
bill as a result of including these provisions, without waiving 
or ceding now or in the future this committee's jurisdiction 
over the provisions in question. I will seek to have conferees 
appointed for these provisions during any House-Senate 
conference committee.
    Thank you for your cooperation in this matters.
    With best wishes,
            Sincerely,
                                      Benjamin A. Gilman, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
            Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
                                Washington, DC, September 19, 1996.
Hon. Floyd Spence,
Chairman, Committee on National Security,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of September 
19, 1996, regarding H.R. 3217, the National Invasive Species 
Act of 1996.
    I agree the National Security Committee would be successful 
in obtaining a sequential referral of the proposed section 
1103, Armed Services Ballast Water Programs.
    As noted in your letter, your decision not to seek a 
sequential referral should not be construed as a waiver of the 
National Security Committee's jurisdiction.
    I appreciate your cooperation and the cooperation of your 
staff.
    With kind personal regards, I remain
            Sincerely,
                                             Bud Shuster, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                            Committee on National Security,
                                Washington, DC, September 19, 1996.
Hon. Bud Shuster,
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of 
        Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Bud: I understand the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure has recently ordered reported H.R. 3217, the 
National Invasive Species Act of 1996. The bill includes a 
provision relating to naval ballast water programs that falls 
within the legislative jurisdiction of the Committee on 
National Security pursuant to House Rule X.
    In recognition of your committee's desire to bring this 
legislation expeditiously before the House of Representatives, 
the Committee on National Security will forego a request for 
sequential referral of the bill, without waiving or diminishing 
this committee's jurisdiction over issues with which it is 
concerned. Of course, this committee will seek the appointment 
of conferees with respect to provisions within its legislative 
jurisdiction during any conference on the bill. I also request 
that this letter be printed in your committee's report on this 
legislation.
    Thank you for your assistance and prompt attention to this 
matter, and I look forward to supporting H.R. 3217 on the House 
floor.
    With warm personal regards, I am
            Sincerely,
                                         Floyd D. Spence, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
            Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,
                                Washington, DC, September 18, 1996.
Hon. Pat Roberts,
Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Longworth House Office Building, 
        Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of September 
16, 1996 regarding H.R. 3217, the National Invasive Species Act 
of 1996, which the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
ordered reported on September 12, 1996.
    I recognize the Committee on Agriculture has a 
jurisdictional interest in some provisions of the bill that 
relate to the programs and activities of the Department of 
Agriculture. I appreciate your decision not to seek a 
sequential referral of the bill and acknowledge this is not to 
be construed as a waiver of your Committee's jurisdiction.
    Thank you for your cooperation and that of your staff.
    With kind personal regards, I remain.
            Sincerely,
                                             Bud Shuster, Chairman.
                                ------                                

                          House of Representatives,
                                  Committee on Agriculture,
                                Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.
Hon. Bud Shuster,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Rayburn HOB, House of 
        Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Chairman Shuster: Last Friday the Counsel for this 
Committee received a telephone call from a representative of 
your Committee informing him last week your Committee had 
reported H.R. 3217, the ``National Invasive Species Act of 
1996'', as amended by an Amendment in the Nature of a 
Substitute. A copy of the latter Amendment was provided to this 
Committee.
    There are two principal provisions in the Amendment in the 
Nature of a Substitute that I believe have an effect on the 
jurisdiction of this Committee. The first relates to the 
appointment of the Secretary of Agriculture as a member of the 
``Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force'' (page 30 of the 
Amendment). The other provision (page 19 of the Amendment) 
relates to the ``Coordination With Other Agencies'' that would 
permit the Secretary of Transportation to use the facilities, 
personnel, etc. of agencies and organizations that have 
contacts with vessels, ``including the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service [APHIS] of the Department of Agriculture''.
    With respect to the provision that applies to APHIS, it is 
not clear whether there would be reimbursement to APHIS for 
such services, etc. One reason I mention this is that a good 
part of the budget of APHIS is funded by user fees that are 
deposited in the Treasury and then an appropriation is enacted 
to provide operating funds for APHIS. However, in recent years 
the importers, who are the principal source of substantial fees 
(such as airlines), have complained that less funds are 
appropriated than are collected in fees and thus the services 
provided are currently strained to meet demands. If there would 
be reimbursement to APHIS, that would address a concern of this 
Committee. On the other hand, if the claim for services on 
APHIS caused problems with these funds that have substantial 
fee-based origins, there could be a future problem with 
``coordination'' by APHIS.
    Finally, addressing the addition of the Secretary of 
Agriculture to the Task Force I understand that there is 
currently an ``ex officio'' status for the Secretary), I would 
suggest that the term ``appropriate Committees'' be amended so 
that it encompassed the House Committee on Agriculture and the 
Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Insofar as that term applied to this Committee, it probably 
would merely result in receiving an occasional copy of an 
existing report made to other committees. (See copy of a 
proposed amendment attached.)
    Please advise me how you might propose to address these two 
issues.
            Sincerely,
                                             Pat Roberts, Chairman.
