_______________________________________________________________________


 Mr. Hyde, from the Committee on the Judiciary, submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 4025]

     [Including cost estimates of the Congressional Budget Office]

    The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred the 
bill (H.R. 4025) for the relief of the estate of Gail E. 
Dobert, having considered the same, report favorably thereon 
without amendment and recommend that the bill do pass.

                                PURPOSE

    H.R. 4025 would provide a lump sum payment to the estate of 
Gail Dobert equal to twice the gross annual pay of Ms. Dobert 
at the time of her death. That sum will be approximately the 
amount the estate would have received had Ms. Dobert had basic 
Federal life insurance.

                               BACKGROUND

    Gail Dobert was the Deputy Director of the Office of 
Business Liaison at the Commerce Department. She was tragically 
killed when the plane carrying Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown 
and his Balkan trade mission crashed into a Croatian hillside.
    As the Deputy Director of Business Liaison, Ms. Dobert 
traveled around the world helping Secretary Brown promote U.S. 
business interests. Prior to working at the Department of 
Commerce, Ms. Dobert had worked with Secretary Brown at the 
Democratic National Committee. Ms. Dobert had also worked as a 
legislative aide for Congressman Gus Yatron (D-Pa.) in the 
1980s.
    Gail Dobert had clearly devoted her life to public service 
and looked forward to a promising career before being cut down 
in the prime of her life. Unfortunately, she had not obtained 
life insurance at the time of her death. H.R. 4025 provides a 
one-time lump sum payment equal to twice Ms. Dobert's gross 
annual pay which is approximately the amount her estate would 
have received had she had basic Federal life insurance. While 
this payment certainly cannot compensate for the enormous 
personal loss suffered by Ms. Dobert's family, the Committee 
intends it to be recognition of Ms. Dobert's contribution to 
public service.

                            COMMITTEE ACTION

    On September 18, 1996, the Committee on the Judiciary 
ordered reported favorably H.R. 4025 without amendment by voice 
vote, a quorum being present.

                      COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee reports 
that the findings and recommendations of the Committee, based 
on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in the 
descriptive portions of this report.

         COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM AND OVERSIGHT FINDINGS

    No findings or recommendations of the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight were received as referred to in 
clause 2(l)(3)(D) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives.

               NEW BUDGET AUTHORITY AND TAX EXPENDITURES

    Clause 2(l)(3)(B) of House Rule XI is inapplicable because 
this legislation does not provide new budgetary authority or 
increased tax expenditures.

               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee sets 
forth, with respect to the bill, H.R. 4025, the following 
estimate and comparison prepared by the Director of the 
Congressional Budget Office under section 403 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 19, 1996.
Hon. Henry J. Hyde,
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 4025, a bill for the relief of the estate of Gail 
E. Dobert, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the 
Judiciary on September 18, 1996. The bill would require the 
Secretary of the Treasury to make a payment of about $129,000, 
which we expect would be made in fiscal year 1997. Because the 
bill would increase direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures 
would apply.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is John R. 
Righter.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                     INFLATIONARY IMPACT STATEMENT

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that H.R. 
4025 will have no significant inflationary impact on prices and 
costs in the national economy.
