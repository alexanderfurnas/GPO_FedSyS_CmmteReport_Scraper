                          Purpose and Summary

    The purpose of H.R. 2923 is to extend a waiver of Section 
1876(f) of the Social Security Act (regarding the 50/50 rule) 
through January 1, 2000, for the Watts Health Foundation. The 
waiver extended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) 
of 1993 expired on January 1, 1996.

                  Background and Need for Legislation

    Under Section 1876(f) of the Social Security Act, Medicare 
risk-contracting plans (managed care plans) are subject to 
rules regarding the enrollment of beneficiaries. One of these 
rules, commonly known as the 50/50 rule, requires that Medicare 
and Medicaid enrollees may not exceed 50 percent of plan 
enrollment. One of the main reasons for the establishment of 
this rule was to serve as a proxy for a plan's quality of care.
    The Watts Health Foundation operates as a health 
maintenance organization (HMO) under the name United Health 
Plan (United), a non-profit, community-based HMO serving the 
Watts community and other areas of Los Angeles. United started 
as a prepaid health care plan in May 1973, and became 
Federally-qualified as an HMO in 1982. United has nearly 90,000 
enrollees, approximately 21 percent of whom are enrolled in 
commercial accounts. United began serving Medicare 
beneficiaries under a demonstration in 1984. At the conclusion 
of the demonstration, United obtained a risk contract to 
provide HMO services to Medicare beneficiaries. It currently 
has 13,101 Medicare enrollees. Watts operates in a medically 
underserved inner city, making it difficult to meet the 50/50 
rule.
    On March 25, 1985, the Health Care Financing Administration 
granted Watts a temporary waiver from the 50/50 rule. Congress 
granted Watts another temporary waiver until January 1, 1990 as 
part of OBRA 1987. This was extended to January 1, 1994 by OBRA 
1989 and to January 1, 1996, by OBRA 1993. Watt's waiver 
expired at the end of calendar year 1995. To allow Watts to 
continue to provide care to its Medicare enrollees, its waiver 
must be extended.
    Below is a letter from the Committee on Commerce and the 
Committee on Ways and Means expressing the intent to extend the 
waiver for the Watts Health Foundation.

                                             U.S. Congress,
                                   Washington, DC, August 27, 1996.
Bruce C. Vladeck, Ph.D,
Administrator, Health Care Financing Administration, Hubert Humphrey 
        Building, Washington, DC.
    Dear Dr. Vladeck: We understand that the statutory waiver 
of the Medicare private, public, enrollment mix requirements, 
the so-called ``50/50 rule,'' has expired for the Watts Health 
Foundation. This waiver was first enacted by Congress as part 
of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987 and was 
extended in OBRA 1989, and most recently in, OBRA 1993.
    We are writing to inform you that we intend to seek 
legislation that would extend the Watts Health Foundation 
waiver. Since the waiver has expired, and it is our intention 
to act on this matter, we request that you consider these 
factors in oversight of the Watts Health Foundation's 
arrangements with the Medicare program.
    Please contact either Chip Kahn of the Ways and Means 
Health Subcommittee, or Melody Harned of the Commerce Health 
and Environment Subcommittee, if you have any questions 
regarding this matter.
            Cordially,
                                   Michael Bilirakis,
                                           Chairman, Commerce 
                                               Subcommittee on Health 
                                               and Environment.
                                   Henry Waxman,
                                           Ranking Minority Member, 
                                               Commerce Subcommittee on 
                                               Health.
                                   Bill Thomas,
                                           Chairman, Ways and Means 
                                               Subcommittee on Health.
                                   Pete Stark,
                                           Ranking Minority Member, 
                                               Ways and Means 
                                               Subcommittee on Health.

                                Hearings

    The Committee on Commerce has not held hearings on the 
legislation.

                        Committee Consideration

    On September 18, 1996, the Committee on Commerce met in 
open markup session to consider H.R. 2923, a bill to extend for 
four additional years the waiver granted to the Watts Health 
Foundation from the membership mix requirement for health 
maintenance organizations participating in the Medicare 
Program. A unanimous consent request by Mr. Bliley to discharge 
the Subcommittee on Health and Environment from further 
consideration of H.R. 2923, and to proceed to its immediate 
consideration by the Full Committee was agreed to without 
objection. The Full Committee then ordered H.R. 2923 reported 
to the House, without amendment, by a voice vote, a quorum 
being present.

                             Rollcall Votes

    Clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI of the Rules of the House 
requires the Committee to list the recorded votes on the motion 
to report legislation and on amendments thereto. There were no 
recorded votes taken in connection with ordering H.R. 2923 
reported. A motion by Mr. Bliley to order H.R. 2923 reported to 
the House, without amendment, was agreed to by a voice vote, a 
quorum being present.

                      Committee Oversight Findings

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the Committee has not held 
oversight or legislative hearings on this legislation.

              Committee on Government Reform and Oversight

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(D) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, no oversight findings have been 
submitted to the Committee by the Committee on Government 
Reform and Oversight.

               New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(B) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee states 
that H.R 2923 would result in no new or increased budget 
authority or tax expenditures or revenues.

                        Committee Cost Estimate

    The Committee adopts as its own the cost estimate prepared 
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                  Congressional Budget Office Estimate

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives, the following is the cost 
estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant 
to section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 25, 1996.
Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.,
Chairman, Committee on Commerce,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 2923, a bill to extend for four additional years 
the waiver granted to the Watts Health Foundation, a health 
maintenance organization (HMO) in the Los Angeles area, from 
the Medicare enrollment composition rule, as ordered reported 
by the Committee on Commerce on September 18, 1996. This bill 
would permit the Watts Health Foundation to contract with 
Medicare on a risk basis during contract periods through 
calendar year 2000, without being subject to the requirement 
that persons covered by Medicare or Medicaid constitute no more 
than 50 percent of the plan's enrollment.
    CBO estimates that waiver of the enrollment composition 
rule would increase Medicare outlays by less than $0.5 million 
per year in fiscal years 1997 through 2002, and by a cumulative 
total of about $1 million through fiscal year 2002. Pay-as-you-
go procedures would apply because the bill would affect direct 
spending.
    This bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would impose no costs on state, local, 
or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Tom Bradley.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee finds that H.R. 2923 
would have no inflationary impact.

                      Advisory Committee Statement

    No advisory committees within the meaning of section 5(b) 
of the Federal Advisory Committee Act are created by this 
legislation.
