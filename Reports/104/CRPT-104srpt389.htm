              TITLE I.--RICHMOND NATIONAL BATTLEFIELD PARK

SEC. 101 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
          ``(1) in 1936 the Congress established the Richmond National 
        Battlefield Park in and around the City of Richmond, Virginia. 
        The park's boundary was established to permit the inclusion of 
        all military battlefield areas related to the battles fought 
        during the Civil War in defense of and against the City of 
        Richmond. The park originally included the area then known as 
        the Richmond Battlefield State Park;
          ``(2) the total acreage of the area identified in 1936 for 
        consideration for inclusion in the Richmond National 
        Battlefield Park encompasses approximately 225,000 acres in and 
        around the City of Richmond, Virginia. A study undertaken by 
        the Congressionally authorized Civil War Sites Advisory 
        Commission determined that within those 225,000 acres, the 
        historically significant areas in and around Richmond relating 
        to the campaigns against and in defense of Richmond encompass 
        approximately 38,000 acres. The National Park Service, through 
        its general management planning process for Richmond National 
        Battlefield Park, has identified approximately 7,121 acres 
        which satisfy the National Park Service criteria of 
        significance, integrity, feasibility, and suitability for 
        inclusion in Richmond National Battlefield Park.
           ``(3) there is national interest in protecting and 
        preserving sites of historic significance associated with the 
        Civil War and Richmond; and
          ``(4) the Commonwealth of Virginia and its local units of 
        government have authority to prevent or minimize adverse use of 
        these historic resources and can play a significant role in the 
        protection of the historic resources related to the battles of 
        Richmond.
    ``(b) Purposes.--Therefore, it is the purpose of this title:
          ``(1) to establish a revised boundary for the Richmond 
        National Battlefield Park based on the findings of the Civil 
        War Sites Advisory Commission and the National Park Service; 
        and
          ``(2) direct the Secretary of the Interior to work in 
        cooperation with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the City of 
        Richmond and other political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, 
        other public entities, and the private sector in the 
        management, protection, and interpretation of the resources 
        associated with the Civil War and the Battles of Richmond in 
        and around the City of Richmond, Virginia.''

SEC. 102. MODIFICATION OF BOUNDARY.

    Section 2 of the Act of March 2, 1936 (Chapter 113; 49 Stat. 1155),

Battlefield Park (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the `park' 
shall hereinafter comprise the lands, waters and interests in lands 
therein, comprising approximately 7,121 acres, within the boundary 
generally depicted as ``Park Boundary'' on the map entitled ``Richmond 
National Battlefield Park Boundary Map'', numbered 367-NEFA 80026 and 
dated August, 1996, which shall be on file and available for public 
inspection in the Office of the Director of the National Park Service, 
Department of the Interior.''.

SEC. 103. LAND ACQUISITION.

    The Act of March 7, 1936 (Chapter 113; 49 Stat. 1155), is amended 
by adding a new section 4 as follows:
    ``Section 4. Land Acquisition.--The Secretary is authorized to 
acquire lands and interests in lands within the park's boundary as 
depicted on the map identified in Section 2 by donation, purchase with 
donated or appropriated funds, exchange, or otherwise. Privately owned 
lands or the interests therein may be acquired only with the consent of 
the property owner. In acquiring lands and interests in lands under 
this Act, the Secretary shall acquire the minimum Federal interests 
necessary to achieve the objectives of the park.''.

SEC. 104. PARK MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.

    The Act of March 7, 1936 (Chapter 113; 49 Stat. 1155), is amended 
by adding a new section 5 as follows:

``SEC. 5. PARK MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.

    ``(a) In administering the park, the Secretary shall interpret, for 
the benefit of visitors to the park and the general public, the Battles 
of Richmond in the larger context of the Civil War and American 
history, including the causes and consequences of the Civil War and the 
effects of the war on all the American people.
    ``(b) The Secretary is directed to work with the Commonwealth of 
Virginia, its political subdivisions, including the City of Richmond, 
private property owners, and the private sector to develop mechanisms 
to protect and interpret the resources identified within the boundary 
as depicted on the map identified in Section 2 of this title. In order 
to carry out this section the Secretary is authorized to enter into 
cooperative agreements with the public and private sectors to carry out 
the purposes of this title, and to find means of protecting and 
interpreting the historic resources for the benefit of present and 
future generations in a manner that would allow for continued private 
ownership and use where compatible with the purposes of the park. The 
Secretary is also authorized to provide technical assistance to 
governmental entities, nonprofit organizations and private property 
owners in the development of comprehensive plans, land use guidelines, 
and other activities which are consistent with conserving the historic, 
cultural, natural, and scenic resources found within the park boundary.

SEC. 105.

    Section 3 of the Act of March 2, 1936 (Chapter 113; 49 Stat. 1156) 
is amended by striking the period and inserting ``, and the Act of 
August 21, 1935 (49 Stat. 666; 16 U.S.C. 461-467).''.

           TITLE III--SHENANDOAH VALLEY NATIONAL BATTLEFIELDS

SEC. 301. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
          (1) there are situated in the Shenandoah Valley in the 
        Commonwealth of Virginia the sites of several key Civil War 
        battles;
          (2) certain sites, battlefields, structures, and districts in 
        the Shenandoah Valley are collectively of national significance 
        in the history of the Civil War;
          (3) in 1990, the Congress enacted legislation directing the 
        Secretary of the Interior to prepare a comprehensive study of 
        significant sites and structures associated with Civil War 
        battles in the Shenandoah Valley;
          (4) the study, which was completed in 1992, found that many 
        of the sites within the Shenandoah Valley possess national 
        significance and retain a high degree of historical integrity;
          (5) the preservation and interpretation of these sites will 
        make a vital contribution to the understanding of the heritage 
        of the United States;

        framework requires cooperation among local property owners and 
        Federal, State, and local government entities; and
          (7) partnerships between Federal, State, and local 
        governments, the regional entities of such governments, and the 
        private sector offer the most effective opportunities for the 
        enhancement and management of Civil War battlefields and

        historic core areas.
    (b) Cost Share.--The Federal share of any grant made under this

    (b) Availability of Funds.--Funds made available under subsection 
(a) shall remain available until expended.

                         Purpose of the Measure

    The purpose of H.R. 1091 is to address a number of long-
standing issues at areas administered by the National Park 
Service in the Commonwealth of Virginia and to provide for the 
authorization of the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield National 
Historic Park.
    Title I of the bill would authorize a new boundary for 
Richmond Battlefield National Park and would direct the 
Secretary of the Interior to provide technical assistance and 
work cooperatively with State and local governments, and 
private property owners in order to preserve resources within 
the Park boundary.
    Title II of the bill would authorize the Secretary of the 
Interior to make future minor boundary adjustments to ensure 
continued public access to Shenandoah National Park at existing 
trail heads.
    Title III of the bill would authorize the establishment of 
the Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields in the Commonwealth 
of Virginia as a unit of the National Park System. This title 
would direct the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a 
Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Plan, to enter into cooperative 
agreements, and to render technical and financial assistance to 
further the purposes of the plan. This title would also 
establish the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Commission.

                          Background and Need

                        shenandoah national park

    When Shenandoah National Park was authorized in 1926, 
Congress authorized a boundary of 521,000 acres. The 
legislation stated that the Federal Government could only 
acquire land within this boundary through donation. This land 
acquisition was primarily the responsibility of the 
Commonwealth of Virginia.
    In 1935, the Commonwealth of Virginia donated 160,000 acres 
of land and Shenandoah National Park was established. The Park 
now has about 196,000 acres of land in Federal ownership, but 
still retains the Congressionally authorized boundary of 
521,000 acres. Proponents of this legislation believe that non-
Federal lands within the authorized boundary are either not 
necessary for park purposes or do not contain park qualities. 
Additionally, the current boundary is a source of continuous 
concern for private property owners and local governments who 
strongly believe that boundary modifications should be on the 
basis of Congressional action, not the action of Federal park 
managers.

                     richmond national battlefield

    The battlefield was authorized in 1936 to commemorate the 
Siege of Richmond. The authorizing statute permits the National 
Park Service to acquire from willing sellers, or by 
condemnation with donated funds, any lands within five statute 
miles of the city of Richmond or within five statute miles of 
lands included in the park in 1936. Under the existing law, no 
funds may be appropriated for land acquisition. The Park 
boundary encompasses about 250,000 acres of which the National 
Park Service administers 780 acres. The boundaries pose 
problems similar to those relating to the boundary issue at 
Shenandoah National Park. The National Park Service, through 
its general management planning process, has identified 
approximately 7,121 acres which satisfy the National Park 
Service criteria for significance, integrity, feasibility and 
suitability for inclusion in Richmond National Battlefield 
Park.

                shenandoan valley civil war battlefield

    In 1990, Congress enacted the Civil War Sites Study Act 
(section 1204 of Public Law 101-628). The law directed the 
Secretary of the Interior to prepare a study of Civil War sites 
within the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. The study was 
completed in September of 1992 and transmitted to Congress in 
the summer of 1993.
    The study noted that many of the sites in the battlefields 
sites identified in the study possess national significance. 
The study states that the Shenandoah Valley represents a unique 
geographic and historic resource, possessing tremendous scenic 
beauty and exceptional potential for interpreting aspects of 
the Civil War that are currently not represented in the 
National Park System. In addition, the study concluded that 
many portions of the valley retain a high degree of historic, 
rural, and scenic integrity.
    Until recently, most of the Shenandoah Valley was devoted 
to agricultural use. Proponents of the bill believe that 
increasing development within the valley has begun to threaten 
the integrity of many of the key battlefield sites.

                          Legislative History

    H.R. 1091 was introduced by Congressman Bliley on March 1, 
1995. A hearing was held in the House Subcommittee on National 
Parks, Forests and Lands on March 9, 1995, and the House 
Committee on Resources reported the bill on July 11, 1995. The 
bill passed the House on September 19, 1995.
    Similar provisions are included in S. 305, introduced by 
Senators Warner and Robb on January 31, 1995. Senator Jeffords 
cosponsored S. 305 on February 24, 1995. This legislation is 
similar to S. 1033, introduced during the 103rd Congress by 
Senators Warner, Robb and Jeffords. S. 1033 was reported by the 
Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on May 18, 
1994 and passed the Senate on June 8, 1994. No action was taken 
in the House.
    H.R. 1091 was referred to the Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee on September 20, 1995. Reports from the 
Department of the Interior and Office of Management and Budget 
were requested on March 20, 1996. A hearing on H.R. 1091 and S. 
305 was held by the Subcommittee on Parks, Historic 
Preservation and Recreation on March 21, 1996. At the business 
meeting on September 12, 1996, the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources ordered H.R. 1091 reported, as amended.

                        Committee Recommendation

    The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in an open 
business session on September 12, 1996, by a unanimous voice 
vote of quorum present, recommends that the Senate pass H.R. 
1091, if amended as described herein.

                          Committee Amendment

    During the consideration of H.R. 1091, the Committee 
adopted an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The amended 
bill eliminates the section in the original bill pertaining to 
the transfer of county road corridors and at Shenandoah 
National Park. This provisions was included as Section 349 of 
Public Law 104-59, the National Highway Systems Designation Act 
of 1995. The amended bill also eliminates a section pertaining 
to the transfer of a sewage disposal system and right-of-way at 
Colonial National Historic Park, and a section pertaining to 
the addition of lands at Cumberland Gap National Historical 
Park. These provisions are addressed in other bills pending in 
the Committee (S. 115 and H.R. 694 respectively).
    The amended bill authorizes a new boundary for Richmond 
Battlefield National Park. This boundary adjustment is based on 
recommendations contained in the Richmond Battlefield National 
Park general management plan, which was completed by the 
National Park Service in August, 1996. The amended bill 
incorporated the Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields 
language from S. 305.

evaluation of the regulatory impact which would be incurred in 
carrying out H.R. 1091. The bill is not a regulatory measure in 
the sense of imposing Government-established standards or 
significant economic responsibilities on private individuals 
and businesses.
    No personal information would be collected in administering 
the program. Therefore, there would be no impact on personal 
privacy.
    Little, if any, additional paperwork would result from the 
enactment of H.R. 1091, as ordered reported.

                        Executive Communications

    On September 13, 1996, the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources requested legislative reports from the Department of 
the Interior and the Office of Management and Budget setting 
forth Executive agency recommendations on H.R. 1091. These 
reports had not been received at the time the report on H.R. 
1091 was filed. When these reports become available, the 
Chairman will request that they be printed in the Congressional 
Record for the advice of the Senate.

   Statement of Katherine H. Stevenson, Associate Director, Cultural 
     Resource Stewardship and Partnerships, National Park Service, 
                       Department of the Interior

    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to appear today 
to present the position of the Department of the Interior.


                       h.r. 1091, virginia parks


    Due to the complexity of this bill, I will address each 
title individually.
    Title I, Richmond National Battlefield Park. Mr. Chairman, 
we support revision of the boundary of Richmond National 
Battlefield Park, but not in the manner which it is being done 
through this title. The current boundary far exceeds what is 
suitable and feasible for inclusion in the Richmond National 
Battlefield Park. As we testified in the House of 
Representatives in March, 1995, we were completing a general 
management plan for Richmond which would include a 
recommendation for a revised boundary. Since then we have 
continued to work on the plan and are in the final stages of 
its completion. The remaining tasks involve incorporation of 
final comments into the plan, printing and distributing of the 
plan, and notification in the Federal Register of the plan's 
completion and availability. We have selected our preferred 
alternative and have developed our position for a revised 
boundary. We recommend that the Committee consider these 
recommendations in making any amendments to Richmond's enabling 
legislation.
    The enabling legislation for Richmond National Battlefield 
allows the Secretary of the Interior to assemble lands, 
structures, or other properties in the military battlefield 
area within five miles of Richmond's city limits to create the 
Richmond National Battlefield Park. The area encompassed by 
that language takes in approximately 225,000 acres in and 
around the City of Richmond. It has been determined through 
both our planning process and the Civil War Sites Advisory 
Commission's report that the area of historical significance 
within that larger area covers approximately 38,000 acres. 
Applying the National Park Service's criteria of significance, 
integrity, feasibility, and suitability, we have determined 
that approximately 7,010 acres of those 38,000 acres meet those 
criteria and qualify for inclusion in the park. We recommend 
that the Committee revise the boundary of Richmond National 
Battlefield Park and limit it to the lands identified in the 
general management plan that make up those approximately 7,010 
acres. We will be happy to work with the Committee to develop 
language that would accomplish this.
    As part of the boundary modification we would recommend 
that the park's authority to acquire land also be modified. We 
suggest that the National Park Service be granted authority to 
acquire land by donation, purchase with appropriated or donated 
funds, exchange, or otherwise, with the limitation that 
acquisition of privately owned lands or interests therein may 
occur only with the consent of the property owner. We also 
believe that protection of the 7,010 acres does not have to be 
entirely the responsibility of the Federal government, and 
request that the Committee authorize the National Park Service 
to enter into cooperative agreements with other public 
entities, individual property owners and private organizations 
to protect, interpret and manage these lands.
    Title I allows for the donation of four properties 
totalling approximately 910 acres. These four properties are 
identified in the general management plan and are included in 
the 7,010 acre recommendation. With regard to the site of the 
Battle of New Market Heights, we have completed as part of the 
general management plan a study regarding the site's 
significance and integrity. We would be more than happy to work 
with the Commonwealth of Virginia, Henrico County officials and 
the property owners to develop a plan that would adequately 
protect this site so that this important aspect of American 
history, commemorating the story of fourteen African American 
recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor, can be 
interpreted to the public.
    We look forward to working with the Committee on 
alternative language that would revise the boundary of Richmond 
National Battlefield Park and allow the National Park Service 
to work in partnership with state and local officials, the 
private sector and private property owners in carrying out the 
recommendations of our general management plan to protect 
significant Civil War resources in and around Richmond.
          Title II, Shenandoah National Park. Mr. Chairman, 
        Section 201 of Title II would modify the boundary of 
        Shenandoah National Park to include only those lands 
        currently in federal ownership but would permit minor 
        boundary adjustments to improve public access points to 
        the park. It would also define the circumstances under 
        which land could be acquired to resolve public access 
        problems. We oppose the enactment of Section 201. As 
        with Richmond National Battlefield, we recognize the 
        need for a revised boundary at Shenandoah National Park 
        and recommend that the Congress defer action on a 
        boundary modification until we have completed a study 
        of Shenandoah National Park's boundary.
          We clearly understand the need to modify the 
        legislated boundary within which land can be acquired 
        (currently only through donation) for Shenandoah 
        National Park. However, limiting the National Park 
        Service's land acquisition authority to minor boundary 
        adjustments that resolve public access problems is 
        inadequate. Shenandoah National Park is surrounded by 
        development that is not always harmonious with the 
        natural systems of the park, and new development is 
        occurring on all sides of the park. There are resources 
        not currently a part of the park that have natural and 
        cultural significance that should possibly be included 
        in the park. Limiting the National Park Service's 
        ability to modify the boundary of the park to resolve 
        access problems can compromise the integrity of those 
        resources and the purpose for which Shenandoah National 
        Park was established. Further, it would affect the 
        ability of those individuals who have made provisions 
        to donate land to the park or may desire to do so in 
        the future.
          We are currently involved in a related-lands study 
        which will determine those areas adjacent to the park 
        that have significant value and might be suitable for 
        inclusion in the park. The study will also address 
        those areas within the legislated boundary that are not 
        appropriate for inclusion. This study can be completed 
        in the next two years. After the study is completed, we 
        can recommend a boundary modification. We request that 
        the Congress defer action on a boundary modification 
        until that study and recommendations are completed. If 
        Congressional action is essential at this time, we 
        recommend that interim restrictions be imposed that 
        limit the ability of the park to acquire land until the 
        study is completed and the boundary is revised by the 
        Congress. We would be happy to work with Committee in 
        drafting language that would address both the matter of 
        a boundary revision and interim restrictions on land 
        acquisition at Shenandoah National Park.
          As stated in my opening remarks, Section 202 of Title 
        II, that would transfer secondary roads currently owned 
        by the National Park Service to the Commonwealth of 
        Virginia, has been enacted into law by this Congress. 
        We have begun the process of the transfer and are 
        working with the Commonwealth of Virginia to see that 
        the transfer occurs in a timely manner with the goal of 
        completing the transfer by the end of this summer.
          Title III, Colonial National Historical Park. Title 
        III calls for a modification of the boundary of 
        Colonial National Historical Park and the transfer of 
        existing sewage treatment systems from the National 
        Park Service to York County, Virginia. It also limits 
        the amount the National Park Service may spend on lands 
        to be acquired in the boundary modification to 
        $830,000. Mr. Chairman, we support the enactment of 
        this title with a minor amendment.
          The boundary modification would override the current 
        limitation on the width of the corridor for the 
        Colonial Parkway in the area between Mill Creek and 
        Neck O'Land Road in order to protect parkway scenery 
        from subdivision development. This legislation is 
        necessary to authorize the Secretary to acquire the 
        existing land--mostly wooded--along the parkway. In 
        1993 the parkway's beauty would have been marred by the 
        construction of 16 to 20 houses within 85 feet of the 
        roadway. The area in question could not be adequately 
        screened. Fortunately, The Conservation Fund, a non-
        profit organization, purchased the property just before 
        construction was to begin. The total acquisition cost 
        of the lots purchased by The Conservation Fund, which 
        includes a 3.2-acre archeological site, is $915,000. 
        Modification of the boundary would allow the National 
        Park Service to acquire the land from The Conservation 
        Fund and thus ensure the scenic quality of the Colonial 
        Parkway.
          We request that the dollar limitation of $830,000 for 
        the boundary modification be dropped. Without a 
        boundary modification the National Park Service could 
        not acquire the property at the time it was being 
        developed. The Conservation Fund acquired the property 
        to prevent it from being developed. The expenses 
        incurred by The Conservation Fund for acquisition and 
        maintenance since the property was acquired exceed the 
        $830,000 limitation. The dollar limitation may prevent 
        the Service from acquiring this important piece of 
        property along the Colonial Parkway. We recommend that 
        the limitation be dropped so that the land may be 
        acquired by the National Park Service.
          The transfer of the existing sewage disposal systems 
        owned by the United States and located within Colonial 
        National Historical Park, together with such rights-of-
        way as are necessary to maintain and operate the 
        system, would release the National Park Service from 
        its current obligation to maintain sewer systems for 
        Yorktown, Virginia. The title would also permit the 
        Secretary to pay a portion, not to exceed $110,000, of 
        the cost of repair and rehabilitation of the system.
          In 1948 and 1956, Congress directed the National Park 
        Service to design and construct sewer systems to serve 
        federal and non-federal properties in the area of 
        Yorktown, a community within and adjacent to Colonial 
        National Historical Park. At that time, York County was 
        a rural area with limited financial resources. The 
        County now has a fully functioning Department of 
        Environmental Services, which operates sewer systems 
        throughout the remainder of the County.
          In the mid-1970s, the National Park Service provided 
        York County with approximately $73,500 to improve the 
        Yorktown system and take over its maintenance and 
        operation. However, the portion of the system that 
        serves the Moore House subdivision was not upgraded and 
        is in need of approximately $203,000 to rehabilitate it 
        to current county standards. Discussions with the 
        County indicate that the National Park Service share of 
        the upgrade would not exceed $110,000. York County is 
        willing to accept the sewer system, if the Moore House 
        subdivision portion is upgraded prior to transfer. The 
        National Park Service is willing to share the cost of 
        the upgrade, subject to the availability of funds. Such 
        expense is cost-effective relative to the cost of long-
        term capital improvements and operation and maintenance 
        that would be required if the National Park Service 
        were to retain ownership of the systems. A letter and a 
        copy of a resolution from York County verifying its 
        interest are attached to this statement for inclusion 
        in the record.
          Further, the proposed legislation provides for a 
        cooperative agreement with the County for 
        rehabilitation of the sewage disposal system that would 
        reduce, or eliminate, the amounts charged to the NPS 
        for its sewage disposal. This agreement would also 
        provide for minimizing the impact of the sewage 
        disposal system on the park and its resources.
          Title IV, Shenandoah Valley Battlefields. We provided 
        comments on S. 305 earlier in this testimony. Those 
        comments are applicable to this title of H.R. 1091.
          Title V, Cumberland Gap National Historical Park. Mr. 
        Chairman, this title would allow the National Park 
        Service to acquire up to 10 acres of land or interests 
        in land for trailheads to be located at White Rocks and 
        Chadwell Gap in Cumberland Gap National Historical Park 
        in Virginia. We support this provision. Current 
        authority restricts the park's expansion. This 
        provision would enable the National Park Service to 
        acquire land in an area of the park where access 
        problems exist.
