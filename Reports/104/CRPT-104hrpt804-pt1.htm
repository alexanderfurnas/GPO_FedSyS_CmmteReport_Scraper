 September 17, 1996.--Referred to the House Calendar and ordered to be 
                                printed

                                _______
                                

  Mr. Spence, from the Committee on National Security, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

                    [To accompany H. Con. Res. 180]

      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

  The Committee on National Security, to whom was referred the 
concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 180) commending the 
Americans who served the United States during the period known 
as the Cold War, having considered the same, report favorably 
thereon with amendments and recommend that the concurrent 
resolution be agreed to.
  The amendments are as follows:
  Strike out all after the resolving clause and insert in lieu 
thereof the following:

That Congress hereby commends, and expresses it gratitude and 
appreciation for, the service and sacrifices of the members of the 
Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the Government who contributed 
to the historic victory in the Cold War.

  Amend the preamble to read as follows:

  Whereas during the period of the Cold War, from the end of World War 
II until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States 
and the Soviet Union engaged in a global military rivalry;
  Whereas this rivalry, potentially the most dangerous military 
confrontation in the history of mankind, has come to a close without a 
direct superpower military conflict;
  Whereas military and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense, 
personnel in the intelligence community, members of the foreign 
service, and other officers and employees of the United States 
faithfully performed their duties during the Cold War;
  Whereas many such personnel performed their duties while isolated 
from family and friends and served overseas under frequently arduous 
conditions in order to protect the United States and achieve a lasting 
peace; and
  Whereas the discipline and dedication of those personnel were 
fundamental to the prevention of a superpower military conflict: Now, 
therefore, be it

  Amend the title so as to read:

    A concurrent resolution commending the members of the Armed 
Forces and civilian personnel of the Government who served the 
United States faithfully during the Cold War.

                         purpose and background

    The victory over the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact 
countries brought over 40 years of East-West confrontation to 
an end. This victory would not have been possible without the 
extraordinary effort and dedication of the men and women of the 
armed forces, as well as the civilian personnel of the federal 
government. These individuals served the United States with 
skill, dedication, determination, and discipline throughout the 
Cold War. They dedicated their daily lives to overcoming the 
challenges of the superpower confrontation, deterring a nuclear 
conflict, and winning a lasting peace.
    House Concurrent Resolution 180 would honor the many 
military members and civilian employees of the Department of 
Defense, the intelligence community, the foreign service 
community, and other federal agencies whose personal commitment 
and sacrifices contributed to the victory in the Cold War.

                          legislative history

    House Concurrent Resolution 180 was introduced on May 22, 
1996. The measure was referred to the Committee on National 
Security and to the Committee on International Relations and 
the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
    On September 12, 1996, the Committee on National Security 
met to consider House Concurrent Resolution 180. The committee 
agreed to an amendment in the nature of a substitute that would 
make miscellaneous drafting and stylistic changes to the 
resolution as introduced. The resolution was ordered favorably 
to the House by a unanimous voice vote.

                           committee position

    On September 12, 1996, the Committee on National Security, 
a quorum being present, approved House Concurrent Resolution 
180, as amended, by a unanimous voice vote.

                   communication from other committee

                          House of Representatives,
                      Committee on International Relations,
                                Washington, DC, September 17, 1996.
Hon. Newt Gingrich,
Speaker of the House of Representatives,
Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Speaker: I write with regard to H. Con. Res. 180, 
a resolution commending the members of the Armed Forces and 
civilian personnel of the Government who served the United 
States faithfully during the Cold War. This bill was introduced 
on May 22, 1996, and was referred to the Committee on National 
Security, and in addition, to the Committee on International 
Relations and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. I 
understand the Committee on National Security ordered the 
resolution favorably reported on September 12, 1996.
    The purpose of this bill is to commend and express the 
gratitude and appreciation of the Congress for the service and 
sacrifices of the members of the Armed Forces and civilian 
personnel of the U.S. Government who contributed to our victory 
in the Cold War.
    The Committee on International Relations has closely 
reviewed H. Con. Res. 180, and has no objections to the 
resolution. Accordingly, in order to expedite consideration of 
this measure in the House, the Committee waives its right to 
take up the bill. I therefore ask that the Committee be 
discharged from its further consideration.
    The Committee on International Relations wishes to make 
clear that the foregoing waiver should not be construed as a 
waiver of the Committee's jurisdiction with respect to any of 
the legislative provisions in H. Con. Res. 180 that fall within 
its jurisdiction. The Committee also wishes to preserve its 
prerogatives with respect to any House-Senate conference on 
this resolution and any Senate amendments thereto.
    Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look 
forward to strongly supporting H. Con. Res. 180 on the House 
floor.
            With best wishes,
                                              Ben Gilman, Chairman.

                              fiscal data

    Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XIII of the Rules of the House 
of Representatives, the committee attempted to ascertain annual 
outlays resulting from the resolution during fiscal year 1997 
and the four following fiscal years. The results of such 
efforts are reflected in the cost estimate prepared by the 
Director of the Congressional Budget Office under section 403 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which is included in 
this report pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(C) of House rule XI.

 Congressional Budget Office estimate

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the cost estimate 
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office and submitted 
pursuant to section 403(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974 is as follows:

Congressional Budget Office cost estimate

                                                September 16, 1996.
Hon. Floyd Spence,
Chairman, Committee on National Security,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H. Con. Res. 180, as ordered reported by the House 
Committee on National Security on September 12, 1996. The 
resolution would commend the members of the armed forces and 
civilian personnel of the government who served the United 
States faithfully during the Cold War. CBO estimates that the 
resolution would have no impact on the budgets of federal, 
state, or local governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Kent 
Christensen.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

Committee cost estimate

    Pursuant to clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the committee generally concurs with 
the estimate as contained in the report of the Congressional 
Budget Office.

Inflation impact statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the committee concludes that the 
resolution would have no significant inflationary impact.

                           oversight findings

    With respect to clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, this legislation results from 
hearings and other oversight activities conducted by the 
committee pursuant to clause 2(b)(1) of rule X.
    With respect to clause 2(l)(3)(B) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives and section 308(a)(1) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, this legislation does not 
include any new spending or credit authority, nor does it 
provide for any increase or decrease in tax revenues or 
expenditures. The fiscal features of this legislation are 
addressed in the estimate prepared by the Director of the 
Congressional Budget Office under section 403 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
    With respect to clause 2(l)(3)(D) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, the committee has not received 
a report from the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight 
pertaining to the subject matter of House Concurrent Resolution 
180.

                     statement of federal mandates

    Pursuant to section 423 of Public Law 104-4, this 
legislation contains no federal mandates with respect to state, 
local, and tribal governments, nor with respect to the private 
sector. Similarly, the resolution would provide no unfunded 
federal intergovernmental mandates.

                             rollcall votes

    With respect to clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, no rollcall votes were taken 
with respect to the committee's consideration of House 
Concurrent Resolution 180.
    The committee ordered House Concurrent Resolution 180 
reported to the House with a favorable recommendation by a 
unanimous voice vote, a quorum being present.
