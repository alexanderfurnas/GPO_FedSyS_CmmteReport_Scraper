The House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee: A Track Record of 
                     Success in the 104th Congress

``Building for America's Future''
    This simple phase is emblematic of the House Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee's work and remarkable record in 
the 104th Congress. Indeed, building and maintaining a 
transportation infrastructure that enables our economy to 
thrive and providing communities with a safe and reliable 
environmental infrastructure is what the Committee is all 
about.
    In the 104th Congress, the Committee undertook an ambitious 
agenda. Not only was its jurisdiction expanded to include 
railroads, Coast Guard, and maritime issues--giving it one of 
the largest jurisdictions in the U.S. House of 
Representatives--but, working together on a bipartisan basis, 
the Committee tackled a multitude of important issues, 
providing national leadership in all aspects of our 
transportation systems and environmental infrastructure.
    Through its six subcommittees--Aviation, Coast Guard and 
Maritime Transportation, Public Buildings and Economic 
Development, Railroads, Surface Transportation, and Water 
Resources and Environment--the 64-Member T&I Committee held 137 
hearings and markups, heard testimony from over 1,200 public 
witnesses, and conducted 51 legislative mark-ups. The total of 
188 Committee meetings in a single Congress is a testament to 
the efforts and dedication of Members and staff.
    On a substantive level, the Committee shaped legislation to 
finance the development of our nation's infrastructure into the 
next century. In doing so, it reaffirmed the important Federal 
role in developing both transportation and environmental 
infrastructure to help create jobs and spur economic growth. At 
the same time, the Committee reviewed long-standing Federal 
agencies and programs, reforming or modifying those that no 
longer served the country well. It sought to streamline Federal 
regulatory requirements and to return power to States and local 
communities where appropriate. The Committee also examined the 
safety of our various transportation modes and developed 
several legislative reforms to address shortcomings. Finally, 
the Committee worked to achieve progress in protecting our 
environment through a sound policy and environmental framework.
    Ever since this country was founded, the importance of our 
transportation system has been a nationally recognized 
priority. Beginning with our ocean ports, and then later 
canals, railways, highways, and airports, wherever there were 
transportation links, communities prospered. Given today's 
increasingly global marketplace, where just-in-time 
manufacturing is becoming a major competitive requirement, the 
need for an efficient intermodal transportation system is more 
important than ever before.
    Unfortunately, the current budget inhibits investments in 
infrastructure. Unlike most state governments, the Federal 
budget does not differentiate between capital and consumption 
spending. If it did, much of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee's expenditures would fall under a 
capital investment budget. Although four user-financed 
transportation trust funds (aviation, highway, inland 
waterways, and harbor maintenance) were established to ensure 
continued capital investment in roads, bridges, transit, 
airports, harbors, locks, and canals, they are tied to a 
unified budget. As Federal entitlements grow and pressure to 
balance the budget increases, spending from the ever-growing 
trust funds erodes.
    To break this destructive status quo, T&I Committee Members 
unanimously sponsored H.R. 842, the ``Truth In Budgeting Act,'' 
bipartisan legislation adopted by the full House on an 
overwhelming 284-143 vote, that would free the transportation 
trust funds from the Federal budget, thereby allowing them to 
operate on a pay-as-you-go basis as originally intended. The 
goal of the legislation is to ensure that money collected from 
system users is spent as the Federal Government promised--to 
maintain and improve the infrastructure relied upon to 
transport goods, services, and people.
    With enactment of H.R. 2274/S.440, the ``National Highway 
System Designation Act,'' the National Highway System (NHS) was 
established. The NHS, comprised of 160,000 of the most 
important miles of highway in America, will be to the 21st 
Century what the Interstate Highway System was to the 20th 
Century. The Act made available to the States nearly $12 
billion in National Highway System (NHS) and Interstate 
maintenance funds. This represents a major investment in our 
economy, creating jobs and ensuring that our network of 
highways can meet the challenges of the 21st Century. The U.S. 
Department of Transportation estimates that every $1 billion 
invested in highway infrastructure directly creates 42,000 
high-paying jobs. But the benefits of our transportation 
infrastructure extend beyond job creation. Transportation is 
the lifeblood of our economy. One only needs to recall the 
historic blizzard that engulfed the Northeast in early January 
1996 to understand the vital role transportation plays in our 
daily lives. Indeed, many cities in the Northeast and Middle 
Atlantic States were utterly paralyzed. The losses in terms of 
productivity to all business sectors was pronounced. Imagine if 
our economy relied on a crippled transportation system year-
round.
    Another critical transportation investment was made in our 
aviation system with the successful passage of H.R. 3539, 
authorizing the Airport Improvement Program (AIP). This bill 
provides $7 billion from Aviation Trust Fund receipts for 
capital expansion projects. Already, 23 airports experience 
more than 20,000 hours of delays annually. The number of 
airports with significant delays is expected to grow to 33 by 
2002. Moreover, growth in passenger travel is expected to 
double in the next fifteen years, from 500 million to one 
billion passengers annually. AIP funds are critical to ensuring 
our system can safely meet the needs of the flying public.
    The Committee also reaffirmed its commitment to our 
nation's environmental infrastructure. In H.R. 961, the ``Clean 
Water Amendments of 1995,'' the Committee authorized $2.3 
billion a year for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) 
to finance wastewater infrastructure and source water 
protection. In H.R. 3604/S. 1316, the ``Safe Drinking Water Act 
Amendments,'' which became law on August 6, 1996, the Committee 
was instrumental in assuring that $1 billion a year would be 
available to States and communities for an SRF to help fund 
improved drinking water infrastructure. Communities are able to 
leverage SRF money in bond markets to reap benefits several 
times greater than they would through a conventional grant 
program. Both loan programs allow small and disadvantaged 
communities to acquire low- or no-interest loans. Moreover, 
these innovative accounts will become self-sustaining as 
communities begin to repay the loans.
    H.R. 3593/S. 640, the ``Water Resources Development Act,'' 
makes further investments in both our economic and 
environmental infrastructure by providing a $3.8 billion 
Federal authorization for navigation, flood control, and 
environmental restoration projects carried out by the Army 
Corps of Engineers. Navigation projects undertaken by the Corps 
and authorized through this legislation represent the backbone 
of the nation's waterborne commerce. In the environmental 
arena, the Corps is uniquely capable to undertake efforts in 
hurricane and flood protection as well as programs that improve 
our environment, such as wetlands restoration. The economic and 
social benefits to the American people are significant and 
cannot be fully quantified.
    In addition to the key role of the Committee in improving 
the nation's infrastructure, the Committee advanced a number of 
other goals in a variety of pieces of legislation:

        Downsizing Federal bureaucracy: through the ICC 
        Termination Act (enacted into law) and the Ocean 
        Shipping Reform Act, the Committee addressed the need 
        to eliminate wasteful government spending by downsizing 
        the government where possible.
        Making government work better: the House approved 
        legislation to reauthorize and reform Amtrak so that it 
        would be able to operate more as a business. In 
        addition the Committee initiated legislation which was 
        enacted to establish the FAA as an independent agency 
        with greater flexibility in the areas of personnel and 
        procurement and to modernize the Railroad unemployment 
        insurance system.
        Streamlining and improving Federal regulations: In a 
        variety of pieces of legislation (e.g. the Deepwater 
        Port Modernization Act and the Pipeline Safety Act) the 
        Committee sought to streamline the regulatory process.
        Empowering State and local governments: The Committee 
        found opportunities to return power to the States where 
        appropriate (e.g. the National Highway System 
        Designation Act, which eliminated Federal requirements 
        for management systems and crumb rubber usage).
        Promoting Safety: Safety was an important element of 
        many of the Committee's bills (e.g. the National 
        Highway System Designation Act, which requires States 
        to establish and enforce a ``zero tolerance'' level for 
        alcohol for drivers under age 21) as well as the 
        oversight activities of the Committee.

    Thus is the outstanding record of the Committee during the 
104th Congress--and the foundation for our efforts to build for 
America's future in the 105th Congress.
    Few of these many concrete achievements could have been 
realized without the strong bipartisan commitment of our 
membership and the leadership of our Ranking Democrat on the 
Committee, Rep. James Oberstar. Special recognition is also due 
to the Aviation Subcommittee Chairman John J. Duncan, and 
Ranking Democrat William O. Lipinski; Coast Guard and Maritime 
Transportation Subcommittee Chairman Howard Coble and Ranking 
Democrat Bob Clement; Public Buildings and Economic Development 
Subcommittee Chairman Wayne Gilchrest and Ranking Democrat 
James Traficant; Railroads Subcommittee Chairwoman Susan 
Molinari and Ranking Democrat Bob Wise; Surface Transportation 
Subcommittee Chairman Thomas Petri and Ranking Democrat Nick 
Rahall; and Subcommittee on Water Resources Subcommittee 
Chairman Sherwood Boehlert and Ranking Democrat Robert Borksi.
    As productive as the 104th Congress was for our Committee, 
the 105th promises to be even more so as we continue to develop 
transportation and environmental programs to meet our nation's 
needs.
    With my good friend James Oberstar, I look forward to 
building upon the success of the Committee's considerable 
endeavors in the 104th Congress.

                                ------                                


            DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HIGHWAY RELIEF ACT OF 1995

                          (Public Law 104-21)

    The District of Columbia Highway Relief Act permits certain 
Federal-aid highway projects undertaken by the District of 
Columbia to have a Federal share of 100 percent for fiscal 
years 1995 and 1996 due to the District's difficult financial 
situation and its inability to contribute the 20 percent match. 
Without this relief, the District of Columbia would have been 
unable to use its Federal-aid highway funds for 1995 and 1996. 
As a condition of the increased Federal share, the Act directs 
the District to set up a dedicated account for gas tax receipts 
in an amount sufficient to repay the temporarily waived local 
match and to meet future local match requirements. The Act also 
requires that the District's trust fund accounting be analyzed 
by the General Accounting Office.
                                ------                                


 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 
                                  1996

                          (Public Law 104-50)

    In addition to providing funding for the Department of 
Transportation (DOT), the 1996 DOT appropriations law includes 
legislation to reform the Federal Aviation Administration's 
(FAA) personnel and procurement rules. The law exempts FAA from 
many personnel and procurement requirements and allows FAA to 
establish a unique approach to its personnel and procurement 
regulations.
                                ------                                


                    EDIBLE OIL REGULATORY REFORM ACT

                          (Public Law 104-55)

    The Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act responds to a concern 
that Federal regulatory agencies, acting under the Oil 
Pollution Act, the Clean Water Act, the Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act and other laws, did not adequately 
distinguish between toxic and petroleum-based oils on the one 
hand and animal fats and vegetable oils on the other. The law 
requires Federal agencies other than the Food and Drug 
Administration and the Food Safety Inspection Service to 
differentiate between and establish separate classes for such 
oils and to consider their different properties and 
environmental effects in implementing such regulatory statutes.
                                ------                                


       ALASKA POWER ADMINISTRATION ASSET SALE AND TERMINATION ACT

                          (Public Law 104-58)

    The primary purpose of this Act is to authorize the export 
of Alaska North Slope crude oil and to authorize the Secretary 
of Energy to sell the Alaska Power Administration. The Act 
required vessels carrying Alaska North Slope crude oil to be 
carried aboard U.S.-flag, U.S. manned vessels.
    Title IV of this Act requires that the Commandant of the 
Coast Guard submit to Congress a plan on the most cost 
effective means of implementing an international private-sector 
tug-of-opportunity system. This plan must utilize existing 
towing vessels to provide emergency response services to any 
vessel in distress transiting the waters within the boundaries 
of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary of the Strait of 
Juan de Fuca.
                                ------                                


            NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT OF 1995

                          (Public Law 104-59)

    The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 
approves the 160,000 mile National Highway System (NHS) and 
permits nearly $13 billion in Interstate Maintenance and NHS 
highway funds to be distributed to the States in 1996 and 1997. 
While comprising only 4 percent of all highways in America, the 
NHS will carry 40 percent of all traffic, 75 percent of all 
freight and 80 percent of all tourism.
    In addition to approving the NHS, this legislation 
eliminates several Federal grant conditions, that had been 
imposed on the States in ISTEA and other transportation laws. 
These would have resulted in State highway fund penalties, 
including the national maximum speed limit, compulsory 
motorcycle helmet use laws, the requirement that States use 
crumb rubber in asphalt, States' utilization of certain 
management systems, preemployment alcohol testing, highway sign 
metrification and certain transportation conformity 
requirements. Second, the legislation creates a motor carrier 
safety pilot program that will permit carriers that utilize 
commercial motor vehicles between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds 
flexibility in complying with Federal motor carrier safety 
regulations if they devise a program of safety management 
controls that DOT determines will provide an equal or greater 
level of safety. It also creates a pilot program to permit 
extended winter deliveries of home heating oil. Third, the 
legislation amends the hours of service regulations for certain 
motor carriers whose activities tend to be seasonal, including 
farmers and farm suppliers during planting and harvesting 
seasons, water well drillers, construction vehicles and utility 
service vehicles, and provides waivers from commercial drivers 
license requirements for part-time employees of small towns and 
townships during snow emergencies.
                                ------                                


 TO DESIGNATE THE RONALD REAGAN BUILDING AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE CENTER

                          (Public Law 104-68)

    This law designates the Federal Triangle Project under 
construction at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, in 
Washington, D.C., as the ``Ronald Reagan Building and 
International Trade Center''. Ronald Reagan was the 40th 
President of the United States and one of the Country's and the 
world's most famous and beloved citizens. President Reagan 
began his career as president of the Screen Actor's Guild, in 
1947. He became a Republican in 1962 and the leader of 
political conservatism in 1964. He was elected Governor of 
California in a landslide victory in 1966 and handily won 
reelection in 1968. Winning the Presidential election in 1980, 
President Reagan revived the Nation's patriotic spirit with the 
optimism and dignity he brought to office. The Reagan 
presidency stood for the message of economic growth and a faith 
in a future full of opportunity, and it is a fitting tribute to 
designate this building in his honor.

    This law designates the United States Courthouse and 
Federal Building to be constructed at the southeastern corner

distinguished jurists. He was appointed to the United States 
District Court in 1947 by President Harry S. Truman and was 
then appointed to the Court of Appeals by President John F.

Education decision. In his years on the Federal bench, Judge 
Bryan earned a reputation as a legal conservative and strict 
constructionist.

       THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION TERMINATION ACT OF 1995

                          (Public Law 104-88)

    This legislation substantially deregulates the rail and 
motor carrier industries and abolishes the 108-year-old 
Interstate Commerce Commission. The rail portions of the bill 
eliminate obsolete rail provisions and transfer remaining 
functions to a 3-member board (the Surface Transportation 
Board) within the Department of Transportation. Provisions and 
activities that are repealed or eliminated by this law include: 
tariff filing, securities jurisdiction, minimum rate 
regulation, State certification, the commodities clause, 
recyclable commodities rate regime, and valuation jurisdiction. 
Functions that are transferred to the Department of 
Transportation include: maximum rate regulation, rail mergers 
and consolidations, various intercarrier transactions, 
abandonments, and labor protection.
    The motor carrier provisions of the ICC Termination Act of 
1995 eliminates some functions of the ICC and transfers most 
remaining motor carrier regulatory oversight functions to the 
Federal Highway Administration. The bill eliminates nearly all 
tariff filings and rate regulation, Federal grants of operating 
authority, Federal and State regulation for office and exhibit 
moves, Federal resolution of routine commercial disputes, any 
possibility of future undercharge claims, restrictions on 
intermodal ownership, review of motor carrier mergers, State 
regulation of transportation intermediaries and restrictions on 
interlining between buses and rail carriers.
    The Act broadens administrative exemption authority, 
modifies the financial reporting requirement to permit carriers 
to apply for an exemption from publication or filing of 
confidential business information, eliminates regulation of 
interstate bus routes and discontinuances, amends household 
goods dispute resolution procedure, streamlines Federal 
regulation of chemical pipelines and directs that registration 
and insurance filings be merged into a single Federal 
registration and insurance system to minimize filing 
requirements. The Act also barred State taxation of interstate 
bus tickets.
    Motor carrier functions transferred to DOT will be carried 
out with no increase in personnel or funding. The primary DOT 
responsibility will be registration of motor carriers and the 
establishment and enforcement of minimum financial 
responsibility requirements. The other major function 
transferred is maintenance of background industry commercial 
rules (such as cargo loss and damage rules and leasing rules).
    Subchapter II of chapter 135 of the Act transfers to the 
Secretary of Transportation and the Surface Transportation 
Board the jurisdiction of the ICC over water carrier 
transportation. The jurisdiction was expanded to include port-
to-port water carrier transportation and transportation to the 
U.S. territories that had been regulated by the Federal 
Maritime Commission (FMC).
    Title IV of the ICC Termination Act includes a requirement 
for the Secretary of Transportation to complete a study of the 
noncontiguous domestic trades within 6 months of enactment of 
this Act to analyze the competition and rate structure in the 
trades, the impact of tariff filing on the trades, the problems 
of parallel pricing and its impact in the domestic trades, 
whether additional protections are needed to protect shippers 
from the abuse of market power, and whether additional 
legislative changes are necessary.

    This bill authorizes the Architect of the Capitol to sell 
the parcel of real property located at 501 First Street, S.E. 
This building, known as the House Annex Building, was acquired 
by Congress in 1984. The Architect of the Capitol was to direct 
the sale of the House Annex Building under the direction of the 
House Office Building Commission at fair market value and 
relocate current tenants to suitable space. Proceeds from the 
sale are to be placed into the Treasury of the United States as 
miscellaneous receipts with the moving costs of the Capitol 
Child Care Center and the Architect of the Capitol Employees 
currently located in the building to come from this account. 
The marketing costs of the sale are limited to $75,000.

Oregon, as the ``David J. Wheeler Federal Building''. David J. 
Wheeler of Baker City, Oregon, was a civil engineer with the 
United States Forest Service who lost his life while performing 
his duties in the Payettee National Forest. On April 26, 1995, 
Mr. Wheeler was on a work detail in the forest inspecting 
bridges, a trip scheduled to last fewer than six weeks. While 
inspecting a bridge at a guard station, he was murdered by two 
boys who had walked away from a detention center. At the time 
of his death, Mr. Wheeler was president-elect of the Baker City 
Rotary Club; a leader in the United Methodist Church; coach at 
the local YMCA; and a member of the Baker City County Community 
Choir. In 1994, Mr. Wheeler had been selected by the Baker 
County Chamber of Commerce as the Baker County Father of the 
Year.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and 
Liability Act of 1980 to allow the Federal government to lease 
Federal property prior to completion of any necessary cleanup 
of that property.
    The legislation also contains several provisions to bring 
Coast Guard personnel benefits and other matters into line with 
those of the Department of Defense.

                     Illinois Land Conservation Act

    Title XXIX of the Act contains the Illinois Land

Officer McCaghren until he was flung from the vehicle. Officer 
McCaghren died the following day from head injuries sustained 
in the incident. Reportedly, with every seizure he made,

won't reach my kids.'' This is a fitting tribute and memorial 
to Officer McCaghren and his devoted service to his family, 
community and country.

Chief Judge of the U.S. Circuit Court from 1953 to 1960. Judge 
Prettyman also served as chairman of the Judicial Conference. 
As a jurist, his most notable decision came when he ruled that 
the State Department has the right to bar travel by U.S. 
citizens to certain areas. He was also a strong advocate of 
providing legal assistance to the indigent, establishing a 
program at Georgetown University to train attorneys to better 
assist indigent clients. Judge Prettyman passed away August 4, 
1971.

Kennedy appointed him the United States District Judge for the 
Middle District of Pennsylvania, making him the youngest 
Federal judge in the country. He has been a member of the 
Federal Bench for 33 years, the longest tenure ever for a judge

        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997

                          (Public Law 104-201)

    The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 
amends section 3(c) of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, 
which is the implementing legislation for Annex V to the 
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from 
Ships, to allow Navy vessels to discharge certain non-plastic, 
nonfloatable solid wastes, where the Secretary of the Navy 
determines that the vessel has a unique military design and 
that full compliance with Annex V is not technologically 
feasible or would impair the operation or operational 
capability of the ship.
    This Act also amends the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Section 
120(d) provides the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency with the authority under section 105 of 
CERCLA to defer listing a Federal facility on the National 
Priorities List if the site is being cleaned up under other 
law. Section 120(h)(3) allows the Federal government to 
transfer Federal property prior to completion of a required 
response action necessary to protect human health and the 
environment, if the property is suitable for the use intended 
by the transferee, if the use is consistent with the protection 
of human health and the environment, the deed or other 
agreement governing the transfer contains the response action 
assurances specified in this section, if public notice is 
provided, and the deferral and transfer will not substantially 
delay cleanup. Section 120(h)(4)(A) clarifies that Federal 
property is not considered contaminated if hazardous substances 
were merely stored on the property, without any release to the 
environment.
    This Act also requires the Navy to develop and implement, 
and EPA to pay for, a program to monitor the concentrations of 
organotin in coastal waters.
    Other provisions address preparedness regarding certain 
emergencies and include roles for the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA).
    This legislation also contains several provisions to bring 
Coast Guard personnel benefits and other matters into line with 
those of the Department of Defense. In addition, the Act 
includes a requirement that the Secretary of Transportation 
certify that all funds transferred from the Secretary of 
Defense to the Coast Guard are used for national defense 
purposes.

        OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997

                          (Public Law 104-208)

    The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act includes an 
amendment to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to clarify when 
lenders and fiduciaries may be held liable under section 107 of 
CERCLA for the cleanup of contaminated property.

                   Hopewell Township Land Conveyance

    Section 410 of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations section 
provides for the conveyance of certain lands and improvements 
in Hopewell, Township, Pennsylvania, to a non-profit 
organization known as the ``Beaver County Corporation for 
Economic Development'' to provide for economic development. The 
bill requires that the General Services Administration transfer 
this land designated as surplus in 1993 at no cost. The goal of 
the land transfer is to utilize this property as the 
centerpiece of a Hopewell Aliquippa Airport Industrial Park and 
thereby promote economic development and create needed jobs for 
the people of Hopewell Township.

                          superfund liability

    Title II of Division A of the Omnibus Consolidated 
Appropriations bill includes the ``Economic Growth and 
Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996,'' a banking 
regulatory reform bill. Subtitle E of the banking bill consists 
of the `Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit 
Insurance Protection Act of 1996.' This Act amends the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and 
Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to clarify when lenders and 
fiduciaries may be held liable under section 107 of CERCLA for 
the cleanup of contaminated property.

             CALIFORNIA BAY-DELTA ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT

    Division E includes provisions to support the California-
Federal Bay-Delta Program in developing, funding, and 
implementing solutions to problems regarding ecosystem quality, 
water quality, water supply and reliability, and system 
vulnerability affecting the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Delta Watershed in California.

       TO DESIGNATE THE MARK O. HATFIELD UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE

                          (Public Law 104-221)

    This legislation designates the United States Courthouse 
under construction at 1030 Southwest 3rd Avenue, Portland, 
Oregon, as the ``Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse''. 
Senator Mark O. Hatfield was born on July 12, 1922, in Dallas, 
Oregon. Senator Hatfield is a dedicated public servant, who 
began his career with a tour of duty in World War II as a Navy 
Lieutenant, j.g. He served in the Oregon Legislature, both 
House and Senate. He became the youngest Secretary of State in 
Oregon history, and in 1958 was elected Governor.
    In 1966, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served 
with distinction for 30 years. Senator Hatfield is known for 
his work on international human rights and environmental issues 
as well as his leadership as Chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee.
                                ------                                


 TO AUTHORIZE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION NATIONAL AIR 
   AND SPACE MUSEUM DULLES CENTER AT WASHINGTON DULLES INTERNATIONAL 
                                AIRPORT

                          (Public Law 104-222)

    The legislation authorizes the Board of Regents of the 
Smithsonian Institution to construct an extension to the air 
and space museum on a 185 acre site at Dulles Airport. The new 
facility will house airplanes, spacecraft, and related 
aeronautical artifacts currently stored outdoors or at the 
Garber facility in suburban Maryland. The extension will also 
provide a restoration facility capable of handling large 
aircraft such as the Enola Gay B-29 bomber. No federally 
appropriated funds will be used to pay for the construction and 
the Commonwealth of Virginia will provide infrastructure 
support with funding, loans, and a bond issue. The Smithsonian 
is responsible for raising funds from the private sector for 
its share of the construction project.
                                ------                                


              TO DESIGNATE THE VEACH-BALEY FEDERAL COMPLEX

                          (Public Law 104-225)

    This legislation designates the Federal building located at 
the corner of Patton Avenue and Otis Street, and the U.S. 
courthouse located on Otis Street, in Asheville, North 
Carolina, as the ``Veach-Baley Federal Complex''. Veach-Baley 
is a combination of the names of two distinguished men from 
western North Carolina who committed their lives to public 
service: John B. ``Jack'' Veach and Judge James M. ``Jim'' 
Baley, Jr. Jack Veach was a pioneer in North Carolina's timber 
industry, and a community leader who served as Chairman of the 
United Way of Asheville and Buncombe County. He also was co-
founder and Chairman of Western Carolina Bank and a past 
director of Carolina Power and Light Company. Judge Jim Baley 
was a lawyer, State Representative, a naval officer, U.S. 
Attorney and Judge to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. He 
also served as Special Judge for the Superior Court. Judge 
Baley was active in church and civic activities. He was a 
deacon in his church, President of the Asheville Civitan Club, 
and a member of the Daniel Boone Council of the Boy Scouts.

            TO DESIGNATE THE SAMMY L. DAVIS FEDERAL BUILDING

                          (Public Law 104-228)

    This bill designates the Federal Building in Overland, 
Missouri, as the ``Sammy L. Davis Federal Building''. In 1966, 
Sammy Davis enlisted in the United States Army and was 
stationed in Viet Nam with the ninth Infantry Division. In 
November 1967, Private First Class Davis distinguished himself 
above and beyond the call of duty. At a remote fire support 
base west of Cai Lay, PFC Davis' position came under heavy 
attack. During a direct enemy assault, his gun crew was killed. 
Sammy Davis took up ranks behind the gun and began returning 
fire himself. After surviving several more attacks and 
sustaining injuries, PFC Davis crossed the river on an air 
mattress to rescue three wounded comrades. After returning to 
the base, he refused medical attention and joined another 
Howitzer crew continuing its assault on the enemy. For his 
gallantry, PFC Davis received the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
Today, Sammy L. Davis travels the country speaking extensively 
on the plight of POW's, Agent Orange and other veterans' 
issues.
                                ------                                


       TO DESIGNATE THE ROMAN L. HRUSKA UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE

                          (Public Law 104-229)

    This bill designates the United States Courthouse to be 
constructed in Omaha, Nebraska, as the ``Roman L. Hruska United 
States Courthouse''. Roman L. Hruska began his career in public 
service as a member and then Chairman of the Douglas County 
Board of Commissioners. In 1952, he was elected to serve in the 
United States House of Representatives. After serving 1 year in 
the House Chamber, he was elected to fill a vacancy in the U.S. 
Senate where he served from 1954 until his retirement in 1976. 
Senator Hruska rose to prominence as the Ranking Republican 
member of the Judiciary Committee. In that position he took 
part in the review of over 300 appointments to the Federal 
Bench. He remained active in local civic affairs.
                                ------                                


        TO DESIGNATE THE SAM M. GIBBONS UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE

                          (Public Law 104-230)

    This law designates the United States Courthouse in Tampa, 
Florida, as the ``Sam M. Gibbons United States Courthouse''. 
After graduating from the University of Florida in 1941, Mr. 
Gibbons enlisted in the United States Army, where he earned a 
bronze star for his role as part of the initial assault force 
on D-Day. He began his career in public service in 1952 as a 
member of the Florida House of Representatives and was elected 
to the United States House of Representatives in 1962. 
Congressman Gibbons served 17 consecutive terms in Congress 
until his retirement in 1996. In 1994, he was appointed acting 
Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. During the 104th 
Congress he served as ranking Democrat on that Committee. 
Through his 34 years of service to Congress, Sam Gibbons has 
conducted himself with dignity and earned the respect of those 
who served with him. This law was amended to include an 
effective date of January 3, 1997, to correspond with 
Congressman Gibbon's retirement from Congress.
                                ------                                


         RAILROAD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-251)

    This law amends the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to 
increase the daily unemployment benefits for railroad workers 
from $36 to $42 and reduces the waiting period before benefits 
begin to accrue from 14 days to 7 days.
                                ------                                


              FEDERAL AVIATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-264)

    This law is an omnibus aviation bill dealing with numerous 
issues including FAA reauthorization, FAA reform, aviation 
security, aviation safety, pilot record sharing, child pilot 
safety, family disaster assistance, airport revenue protection, 
and the Metropolitan Washington Airports issue (P.L. 104-264).
    The bill authorizes three of FAA's four accounts for 2 
years. The total authorization amount is $19.5 billion for 2 
years. The following table shows the funding levels by account.

                 FAA AUTHORIZED LEVELS FOR 1997 AND 1998

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total...........................  9.714.............  9.820             
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account 
is the jurisdiction of the House Science Committee. That 
Committee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation 
Committee chose to reauthorize RE&D for only 1 year.
    The bill also simplifies the Airport Improvement Program 
(AIP) grant formula for 2 years. The new formula assures that 
Letters of Intent (LOIs) are funded, but the discretionary fund 
will be $300 million in 1997 instead of the $325 million 
previously guaranteed. This allows airport entitlement grants 
to increase in 1997 because FAA will no longer need to reduce 
entitlement grants to pay for the discretionary grants.
    The law also establishes an airport privatization pilot 
program. Five airports may volunteer to enter into long-term 
leases or privatization contracts. The program is limited to 
one large airport and three medium, small, or non-hub airports 
that can enter long-term leases and one general aviation 
airport that can enter either a long-term lease or a sale 
agreement. An airport's application for this program has to be 
approved by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and by a 
supra-majority of airlines operating at the airport. This 
program is an attempt to allow private funds to supplement the 
growth of airports since it appears that both local and federal 
funds for airport growth do not satisfy the current needs of 
airports. The program will be audited by the Secretary of 
Transportation.
    Various safety issues were dealt with in this law including 
eliminating FAA's current dual mandate to both regulate and 
promote civil aviation. The law reforms FAA by making FAA more 
independent of DOT and by assuring that the new procurement and 
personnel laws are working effectively. Under the law, FAA 
needs DOT approval only on regulations that impose more than 
$100 million per year in cost. Less expensive regulations can 
be approved by FAA without DOT interference. The law also 
establishes a Management Advisory Council with representatives 
from the aviation industry to advise the FAA Administrator on 
how to improve FAA. This law establishes the National Civil 
Aviation Review Commission, which will study various FAA 
funding and safety issues. FAA's needs; the benefits of taking 
the Aviation Trust Fund off-budget; the establishment of user 
fees; and aviation safety issues will be some of the issue 
reviewed.

                             Antiterrorism

    The law incorporates many security provisions passed by the 
House shortly before the August 1996 recess including requiring 
criminal history background checks for the people who screen 
carry-on luggage at airports. The effectiveness of weapon and 
explosive detection systems will be studied including the 
effectiveness of bomb sniffing dogs as a result of this law. 
The law also requires the FAA Administrator to certify 
companies providing security screening services and to improve 
the training and testing of screeners by establishing uniform 
performance standards for the screeners.

                  airline pilot hiring and safety act

    The law also requires that airlines must request and 
receive the performance records of pilots they are interested 
in hiring. Currently, airlines do not share the records of 
pilots. Although the vast majority of pilots are excellent, 
pilots whose performance may present a safety problem need to 
be weeded out. This law will protect the public from pilots 
with questionable performance records.

                         child pilot safety act

    The law also includes the Child Pilot Safety Act passed by 
the House in July. In the spring of 1996, we all witnessed the 
aircraft wreckage after 7-year old Jessica Dubroff tried and 
failed to set a world record by becoming the youngest person to 
fly across the country. The law forbids a flight instructor 
from allowing someone without a pilot's licence to attempt to 
set a record or engage in aeronautical feats. Since one must be 
16 years old to hold a pilots licence, and anyone without a 
pilot's licence has to fly with a certified flight instructor, 
this will ensure that children cannot be used to set records.

                aviation disaster family assistance act

    The law incorporates the bill to assist families of 
passengers involved in aircraft accidents. The law requires the 
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to be responsible 
for acting as a point of contact within the Federal Government 
for the families of passengers involved in the accident. After 
a major accident, NTSB will designate an independent non-profit 
agency, such as the American Red Cross, to have primary 
responsibility for coordinating the emotional care and support 
of the families of passengers involved in the accident. The law 
requires that airlines provide the passenger manifest with the 
best available information to the non-profit organization 
designated for the accident, if requested. The non-profit 
organization can use the passenger manifest to help family 
members with information about their loved ones. The law 
requires airlines to submit plans to DOT to address the needs 
of families of passengers involved in an airline accident. In 
addition, the bill establishes a task force to develop 
guidelines for such plans. The law also prohibits unsolicited 
communication from lawyers to families of victims or passengers 
who were injured in an accident until 30 days after the 
accident.

            metropolitan washington airports amendments act

    The law also dealt with issues surrounding the Metropolitan 
Washington Airports Authority (MWAA). The law terminates the 
Board of Review, but increases the Board of Directors from 11 
to 13 by increasing the Presidentially appointed members from 1 
to 3. The law also guarantees that the Dulles Airport Access 
Highway remains dedicated for use to Dulles Airport. Congress 
will have to revisit this issue by October 1, 2001, when the 
FAA will no longer be able to issue Airport Grants or approve 
new Passenger Facility Charges for MWAA. Congress has more 
involvement with the Washington airports because National and 
Dulles are the only Federally owned commercial airports in the 
country.
    Finally, the law includes some miscellaneous provisions, 
including an amendment to restore the legal standards for 
coverage under the Railway Labor Act which existed prior to the 
enactment of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination 
Act.
                                ------                                


    TO DESIGNATE THE L. CLURE MORTON UNITED STATES POST OFFICE AND 
                               COURTHOUSE

                          (Public Law 104-277)

    This law designates the United States Post Office in 
Cookeville, Tennessee, as the ``L. Clure Morton United States 
Post Office and Courthouse''. Judge Morton began his career 
with the government as an agent with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation from 1941 to 1945. In 1970, Judge Morton was 
appointed U.S. District Judge by President Richard M. Nixon. He 
was elevated to Chief Judge in 1977 and took Senior Status in 
1984. Judge Morton is best remembered for his decision ordering 
the massive cross-town busing in Nashville which led to the 
desegregation of the Nashville public school system. During his 
tenure on the bench, Judge Morton also ordered sweeping reforms 
in the Tennessee State prison, and welfare and health systems.

        NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD AMENDMENTS OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-291)

    This law reauthorizes the National Transportation Safety 
Board (NTSB) for 3 years with funding levels of $42.407 million 
in 1997, $44.46 million for 1998, and $45.04 million for 1999. 
The law also makes several legislative changes which were 
originally requested by NTSB including: (1) permitting NTSB to 
withhold foreign accident information which will promote 
cooperation with foreign aviation safety authorities and 
improve NTSB's ability to make safety recommendations regarding 
information from foreign aviation accidents; (2) permitting 
NTSB to withhold voluntarily-provided safety information 
allowing NTSB to review safety information that previously the 
airlines would not share with NTSB for fear that the government 
would release it; and (3) allowing NTSB to conduct accident 
investigation classes and charge non-NTSB employees who attend, 
thereby recouping some of its costs.
                                ------                                


                     WATER DESALINATION ACT OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-298)

    The Water Desalination Act of 1996 authorizes the Secretary 
of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of the Army 
and other Federal agencies, to carry out various projects, 
programs, and activities regarding water desalination and 
reuse.
                                ------                                


                WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-303)

    The Water Resources Development Act of 1996 (WRDA) 
authorizes water resources development and conservation 
projects of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. It also modifies 
Corps water projects and policies and modifies the agency's 
water resources programs. The WRDA reflects a continuing 
Federal commitment to water infrastructure maintenance and 
development, responds to initiatives to update water policies, 
and takes advantage of opportunities to strengthen the Corps' 
role in protecting and restoring the Nation's aquatic 
environment. It also resumes the biennial authorization of 
Corps water resources programs and projects. It authorizes 
approximately $3.8 billion in Federal appropriations for water 
resources projects and programs. The total estimated cost 
(Federal and non-Federal) is $5.4 billion.
    Title I of the bill authorizes 31 projects which have 
received final reports of the Chief of Engineers. To address 
projects for which reports were nearly complete, it authorizes 
an additional 13 projects subject to the completion of a final 
Chief of Engineers' report by not later than December 31, 1996. 
Title I also directs the Secretary of the Army to study and, if 
feasible, carry out projects for flood control, navigation, 
stream bank stabilization, shoreline protection, snagging, 
clearing and sediment removal, and improvement of the 
environment under the Corps of Engineers' ``continuing 
authorities'' program.
    Title II contains provisions that are generally applicable 
to Corps of Engineers projects and policies. Among the more 
significant provisions are changes to cost-sharing requirements 
and procedures applicable to the development and implementation 
of flood control projects. The minimum non-Federal share for 
such projects is raised from 25 percent to 35 percent, 
applicable to projects authorized after WRDA '96 and to 
continuing authority projects where project approval occurs 
after enactment of this Act. Procedures relating to the non-
Federal sponsor's ``ability to pay'' are also revised, as are 
requirements for floodplain management plans. In both 
instances, the changes are designed to respond to the evolving 
needs of non-Federal interests in the reduction of damages 
resulting from flooding. Title II also modifies the cost 
sharing applicable to dredged material disposal areas 
associated with navigation projects. The non-Federal share will 
be the same for all methods of disposal, regardless of whether 
the dredged material is placed in open water or in containment 
areas on-shore or near-shore. Title II also modifies or creates 
``environmental'' authorities for the Corps. For example, it 
broadens authority given to the Corps in section 1135 of WRDA 
'86 to modify Corps projects to restore environmental quality, 
thus allowing the Corps to undertake measures where benefits 
may accrue off project lands. It also creates a new 
``continuing authority'' for the Corps by authorizing 
$25,000,000 annually for cost-effective projects to improve the 
quality of the environment, provided the Federal cost for 
individual projects does not exceed $5,000,000. Title II also 
creates a new national dam safety program to facilitate 
improvements in the design and operation of dams. This program 
consolidates within the Federal Emergency Management Agency the 
lead role in coordinating Federal dam safety efforts and in 
providing incentives to States for the effective implementation 
of State programs. Title II addresses numerous other policies 
relating to water resources programs of the Corps, including 
provisions restating Congressional support of, and the Federal 
interest in, the Corps role in shoreline protection, assuring 
fairness to non-Federal sponsors in the cost sharing of 
feasibility studies, facilitating construction of flood control 
projects by non-Federal interests, privatizing the Federal 
hopper dredge fleet, and strengthening current requirements for 
removing obstructions to navigation.
    Title III contains provisions relating to previously 
authorized projects. It modifies projects to reflect changed 
physical, economic and environmental conditions at project 
sites, changing local priorities, and increased project costs. 
It also reauthorizes several projects that were previously 
deauthorized but for which local support has returned. In 
addition, several projects or portions of projects are 
deauthorized to accommodate local desires.
    Title IV authorizes various studies of potential water 
resources projects and requires several reviews of Corps 
policies and capabilities. Although most Corps studies of 
potential water resources projects are authorized by Committee 
resolution, the nature and scope of most of these study 
proposals are beyond that which could be authorized in this 
manner.
    Title V contains provisions responding to miscellaneous 
water resources issues and problems within the Corps program. 
It allows for conveyances of unneeded parcels at existing Corps 
projects to local entities; changes the names of selected Corps 
projects or project features; addresses unique site-specific 
water resources problems; requires the conditional Federal 
assumption of maintenance of locally constructed navigation 
channels; reaffirms the Corps responsibility in periodically 
maintaining beach projects; addresses regional environmental 
issues, such as the restoration and protection of the 
Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes, and the New York City 
watershed; establishes a major new program to restore the 
Everglades ecosystem; and creates a new authority to address 
water resource issues on a watershed basis.
    Title VI makes a conforming amendment to the Internal 
Revenue Code to accompany the changes made to the cost-sharing 
requirements for dredged material disposal for navigation 
projects.
                                ------                                


        ACCOUNTABLE PIPELINE SAFETY AND PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-304)

    The Act reauthorizes the pipeline safety program for fiscal 
years 1996 through 2000. A total of $103.841 million is 
authorized for hazardous liquid and gas pipeline programs, and 
$71 million is authorized for the State grant program. Most of 
the funding is provided through industry user fees.
    The bill incorporates risk assessment and cost-benefit 
analysis in the setting of new pipeline safety standards, based 
on current Office of Pipeline Safety practices in accordance 
with the recent Executive Order regarding cost-benefit 
analysis. In order to focus resources on the greatest risks, 
the bill establishes a risk management demonstration program 
whereby pipeline operators may be exempted from any or all 
safety requirements if the operator submits, and DOT approves, 
a safety plan which will achieve a level of safety equal to, or 
greater than, that which would be achieved through following 
the regulations. The Secretary may revoke any exemption for 
substantial noncompliance or in the case of emergencies. The 
bill also expands criminal penalties to persons who damage 
pipelines and do not report the damage, removes the requirement 
that every pipeline be inspected every 2 years (leaving it in 
the discretion of the Secretary), and makes a series of minor 
and technical changes and corrections.
                                ------                                


                 COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-324)

    The primary purpose of this legislation is to authorize the 
expenditures of the U.S. Coast Guard for fiscal years 1996 and 
1997. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 authorizes the 
portion of the Coast Guard budget that requires an 
authorization at the level of $3.9 billion in fiscal year 1997, 
as requested by the President.
    Title I of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 
authorizes Coast Guard appropriations, active-duty military 
strengths, and military training student loads for fiscal years 
1996 and 1997. Title I also requires the Coast Guard to submit 
quarterly reports to the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure in the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation in the 
Senate concerning the level of expenditures on illegal drug 
interdiction. These reports will allow Congress to ensure that 
resources are not diverted from this vital mission to support 
other Coast Guard functions.
    Title II contains many provisions related to internal Coast 
Guard management matters, including personnel management, 
recruiting, and Coast Guard housing.
    Title III includes various amendments concerning marine 
safety and waterways services management. This title extends 
the charter of several important maritime advisory groups, 
authorizes electronic filing of commercial instruments with the 
Secretary of Transportation, establishes or increases civil 
penalties for violations of certain maritime laws, requires 
emergency locating devices on vessels operating on the Great 
Lakes, provides guidelines for future closures of Coast Guard 
small boat stations, prohibits the repair of Coast Guard 
vessels in foreign shipyards, and limits the use of Coast Guard 
casualty investigations in civil litigation.
    Title IV contains amendments to allow the U.S. Coast Guard 
Auxiliary, a 36,000 member voluntary organization, to provide 
greater assistance to the Coast Guard and the boating public. 
This provision clarifies the organization, legal status, and 
mission of the Coast Guard Auxiliary.

                    DEEPWATER PORT MODERNIZATION ACT

    Title V which will promote greater construction and use of 
deepwater ports by improving the statutory and regulatory 
framework under which deepwater ports operate. Since the 
Deepwater Port Act of 1974 was enacted, only one deepwater port 
has been licensed, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), off 
the coast of Louisiana. The Secretary of Transportation's 1993 
Deepwater Ports study reported that deepwater ports are the 
least environmentally risky of the four modes of delivering oil 
to the United States. This provision reduces unnecessary 
government regulation and will increase the use of LOOP, while 
encouraging the future development of deepwater ports in other 
areas off our Nation's coasts.

                   Coast Guard Regulatory Reform Act

    Title VI implements the new international convention 
entitled the ``International Safety Management Code'' and 
establishes U.S. ship construction and operational standards 
that are comparable to international standards. These 
provisions will allow the U.S. maritime industry to be more 
competitive with foreign ocean carriers, and increase the size 
of the U.S.-flag fleet.
    Title VII contains various technical and conforming 
amendments related to implementation of international tonnage 
measurement (ITC) requirements and other matters, to allow the 
Coast Guard to use ITC tonnage measurements for the application 
of various U.S. laws instead of the old regulatory tonnage 
system used by the Coast Guard.
    Title VIII contains additional requirements related to 
prevention of plastics pollution from ships, including new 
requirements for inspections of port or terminal reception 
facilities and the establishment of a marine debris 
coordinating committee to provide a forum to coordinate 
national and international research, monitoring, education, and 
regulatory actions addressing problems associated with marine 
debris.
    Title IX contains several amendments concerning towing 
vessel safety. These amendments include requirements that the 
Secretary of Transportation issue regulations requiring single-
hull, non-self-propelled tank vessels and towing vessels to 
have additional protections against oil spills following the 
grounding of the vessel and allowing the Secretary to require 
fire suppression devices aboard towing vessels. Title IX also 
requires the Secretary of Transportation to perform several 
studies involving oil pollution.
    Title X contains conveyances of Coast Guard lighthouses and 
other excess property to various organizations.
    Title XI contains several common-sense amendments to the 
Oil Pollution Act of 1990. These amendments relieve thousands 
of marina owners from the burden of securing $150 million in 
oil spill liability insurance. Most marina owners are small 
``mom and pop'' businesses which would be forced out of 
business without this change in the law. The provision also 
provides important insurance relief for oil refineries, 
pipelines, and traditional offshore oil facilities from 
unnecessary and burdensome insurance requirements. The 
legislation reduces the financial responsibility required for 
traditional offshore facilities to $35 million, with the 
authority for the President to increase that amount if he 
determines that the risks require such a result. The provision 
also amends the authority for an oil spill claimant to proceed 
directly against an oil spill insurer to allow ``direct 
action'' only in cases in which the claimant is the Federal 
government, or when the offshore facility owner is insolvent or 
bankrupt.
    Title XI includes limited double hull exemptions for 
certain vessels carrying refined oil in some parts of Alaska; 
eliminates several trust requirements for mortgagees of U.S.-
flag vessels; eliminates the U.S. stock ownership requirement 
for leasing companies financing U.S.-flag vessels engaged in 
the coastwise trade; provides authority for the Secretary of 
Transportation to establish manning requirements for oil spill 
response vessels; includes amendments to the Johnson Act 
affecting gambling aboard vessels in California, Indiana, and 
Alaska; provides authority to charge certain Coast Guard user 
fees for services to foreign passenger vessels; provides a cap 
on Coast Guard user fees for the inspection of certain small 
passenger vessels; includes new vessel financing provisions to 
allow greater foreign investment in the U.S.-flag fleet; 
eliminates certain towing vessel manning and watch requirements 
for the Great Lakes; repeals the requirement for vessels to 
obtain a Great Lakes endorsement; authorizes eight U.S.-flag 
vessels to be placed under foreign registry; provides the 
authority to use foreign flag oil spill response vessels under 
emergency circumstances; and authorizes ``Jones Act'' waivers 
(exemptions from the coastwise trading laws) for approximately 
140 vessels.
    Title XI contains authority for vessel mortgagees to use 
extrajudicial remedies to enforce preferred mortgage liens or 
the outstanding indebtedness secured by the mortgaged vessel; 
amendments to maritime law involving liability of cruise vessel 
operators in certain circumstances; a sense of the Congress 
resolution regarding Coast Guard regulations differentiating 
between petroleum oils and vegetable oils; a requirement for 
the Secretary of Transportation to submit a plan and cost 
estimate to the relevant Congressional Committees for the 
engineering, design, and retrofitting of the Coast Guard 
icebreaker MACKINAW; ``cross-border'' financing authority for 
owners of U.S.-flag vessels; authority for the Secretary of 
Transportation to issue certificates of inspection for certain 
vessels currently under foreign registry; additional law 
enforcement authority for the Coast Guard against vessels 
suspected of drug smuggling on the high seas; amendments to the 
Title XI loan guarantee program administered by the Maritime 
Administration to provide for reactivation of certain U.S. 
shipyards; and amendments to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 
regarding interim payments for oil spill damages, compliance 
with oil spill response plans, and information on scientists 
with oil spill expertise.
                                ------                                


                 NATIONAL INVASIVE SPECIES ACT OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-332)

    The National Invasive Species Act of 1996 reauthorizes and 
amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and 
Control Act of 1990 (NANPCA). NANPCA established a program for 
preventing, researching, monitoring and controlling 
infestations of nonindigenous aquatic species as well as set up 
the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force to develop and oversee 
the program. It also created the Great Lakes Aquatic Nuisance 
Species Panel to help coordinate Federal, State, local and 
private efforts concerning nonindigenous species within the 
Great Lakes basin. NANPCA required the Coast Guard to establish 
voluntary ballast water exchange guidelines for the Great Lakes 
which later became mandatory.
    Public Law 104-332 reauthorizes the NANPCA through the year 
2002 and amends NANPCA to establish a national ballast water 
management program to address concerns about the unintentional 
introductions of aquatic nuisance species in many parts of the 
country. Currently, the exchange of ballast water on the high 
seas is the primary method to prevent the introduction of alien 
species into U.S. waters. Under this Act, the Coast Guard must 
establish voluntary ballast water exchange guidelines which may 
become mandatory for certain vessels throughout the United 
States.
                                ------                                


         OMNIBUS PARKS AND PUBLIC LANDS MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1996

                          (Public Law 104-333)

 TRANSFER OF FEDERAL PROPERTY FOR JAPANESE-AMERICAN PATRIOTISM MEMORIAL

    Section 514 of this bill transfers parcels of land from the 
Architect of the Capitol to the Interior Department, from the 
Interior Department to the Architect of the Capitol and from 
the Federal Government to the District of Columbia for the 
purpose of setting aside land suitable for the proposed 
memorial to honor Japanese-American patriotism during World War 
II. It also clarifies the jurisdiction of property near the 
Capitol Grounds. The proposed memorial was authorized in 1992 
by H.J.Res. 271. There are two parcels of land to be 
transferred from the Architect of the Capitol to the Interior 
Department. The first, slated for the proposed memorial, is 
31,775 square feet and is located at the intersection of New 
Jersey Avenue, Louisiana Avenue and D Street, N.W. The other 
parcel is 11,550 square feet and is bounded by Louisiana Avenue 
and D Street, N.W. This parcel will be set aside for future use 
for a memorial. The land transfer to the District is a portion 
of New Jersey Avenue adjacent to the memorial. The land to be 
transferred to the Architect of the Capitol from the Interior 
Department is land adjacent to, and south of, the Hart Senate 
Office Building.

             CALIFORNIA BAY-DELTA ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT

    The provisions of the California Bay-Delta Enhancement and 
Water Security Act were incorporated into Public Law 104-208, 
the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations for fiscal year 1997. 
Title XI of this Act authorizes $429,900,000 for fiscal years 
1998 through 2000 for Federal activities and support of the 
program.
                 COMMITTEE VIEWS AND ESTIMATES REPORTS

    Pursuant to section 310(d) of the Congressional Budget Act, 
the Committee submitted its Views and Estimates Reports to the 
Committee on the Budget for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 on March 
1, 1995, and February 25, 1994, respectively.
    These reports, intended to provide the Budget Committee 
with an early and comprehensive indication of Committee 
legislation plans for the next fiscal year, contained the views 
and estimates of new budget authority and outlays to be 
authorized in legislation under the Committee's jurisdiction 
which would become effective during the next fiscal year.
     SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
                             INFRASTRUCTURE

              Taking Transportation Trust Funds Off-Budget

    The Committee's top legislative priority was taking the 
four transportation trust funds off-budget. This legislation 
fulfills a promise made by Congress when it levied user fees on 
transportation and dedicated these fees for an intended 
purpose--transportation and not to mask the size of the 
deficit.
    H.R. 842, the Truth in budgeting Act, was ordered reported 
by the Full Committee by unanimous voice vote on May 3, 1995. 
The legislation eventually had 226 cosponsors, including every 
member of the Committee and passed the House on April 17, 1996, 
by a 284-143 vote.
    The legislation takes off-budget four self-financed trust 
funds: the Highway Trust Fund, the Airport and Airways Trust 
Fund, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, and the Inland 
Waterways Trust Fund. Under the current budget process, 
spending out of these four trust funds is held down to mask the 
size of the general fund deficit. Currently, the accumulated 
cash balances from all four trust funds is over $30 billion.
    Taking the transportation trust funds off-budget restores 
faith with the taxpayers. The transportation taxes that go into 
the trust funds were levied on the express promise that they 
would be used only for transportation purposes. Under the law, 
amounts in these trust funds cannot be used for anything else. 
In addition, the law provides that interest on the amounts in 
the trust funds will be credited to and become part of the 
trust funds. While these funds cannot be used for other 
purposes, if spending is held down under the unified budget, 
the general fund deficit will appear to be smaller. H.R. 842 
treats these trust funds from a budget standpoint as they were 
intended to be treated when the taxes were enacted.
    On March 10, 1995, the Subcommittee on Surface 
Transportation held a hearing on H.R. 842 and heard testimony 
from Members of Congress and outside witnesses. In addition to 
testimony on the size of the withheld balances, witnesses 
described the high level of transportation needs waiting to be 
funded and the link between transportation investments and 
improved productivity and economic growth.

      Streamlining and Improving Efficiency of Transportation and 
                        Infrastructure Programs

    On January 31, 1995, the Committee held a hearing to 
identify opportunities for streamlining and improving 
efficiency of transportation and infrastructure programs. 
Testimony was received from a panel of governors, including 
Governor Nelson of Nebraska speaking on behalf of the National 
Governors' Association, Governor Schafer of North Dakota, 
Governor Thompson of Wisconsin, Governor Dean of Vermont, 
Governor Whitman of New Jersey, and Governor Branstad of Iowa. 
The testimony of the witnesses specifically focussed on 
mandates and inefficiencies in environmental programs within 
the Committee's jurisdiction (including the Clean Water Act, 
Superfund, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act 
as it applies to transportation) and in transportation programs 
(including the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act 
of 1991 and Amtrak). In addition, witnesses addressed the 
importance of taking the transportation trust funds off budget 
for achieving infrastructure improvement.

                     Illinois Land Conservation Act

    On April 17, 1995, the Full Committee held a field hearing 
on H.R. 714, the Illinois Land Conservation Act of 1995 in 
Elwood, Illinois. Testimony was received from Federal, State 
and local officials and representatives of veterans, 
conservation, economic development and educational 
organizations. H.R. 714 provides for the conversion of the 
Joliet Ammunition Plant to the Midewin National Tallgrass 
Prairie (MNP) and provides for disposal of real property at the 
Arsenal. The Subcommittee was discharged and H.R. 714, as 
amended, was ordered reported by the Full Committee on June 14, 
1995. H.R. 714 passed the House on July 31, 1995. The bill was 
signed into law as part of Public Law 104-106.

                    The Proposed CSX-Conrail Merger

    The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a 
hearing on the proposed acquisition of Conrail by other major 
rail carriers on November 19, 1996. This hearing focused on the 
standards and procedures employed by the Surface Transportation 
Board (STB) in evaluating major rail merger applications, 
including situations where multiple carriers seek approval to 
acquire the same railroad. The hearing also explored the 
various Federal laws still in force which are limited in their 
application solely to Conrail. No further action was taken on 
the issue during the remainder of the 104th Congress.
         SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON AVIATION

    During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee on Aviation was 
chaired by Congressman John J. Duncan, Jr. Congressman James L. 
Oberstar served as the Ranking Democrat Member of the 
Subcommittee from the beginning of the 104th Congress until he 
assumed the ranking Democrat position for the Full Committee. 
Congressman William O. Lipinski served as the Ranking Democrat 
Member of the Subcommittee for the remainder of the 104th 
Congress. The Aviation Subcommittee held 37 hearings and 
developed significant legislation on Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) reform and reauthorization, and 
reauthorization of the National Transportation Safety Board.
                                ------                                


                          Enacted Legislation

    (For a description of the enacted legislation, see section 
on ``Bills Enacted into Law.'')

 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 
                                  1996

    In addition to providing funding for the Department of 
Transportation (DOT), Public Law 104-50 includes legislation to 
reform the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) personnel 
and procurement rules. The law exempts FAA from many personnel 
and procurement requirements and allows FAA to establish a 
unique approach to its personnel and procurement regulations. 
These provisions were nearly identical to the personnel and 
procurement reform in the Committee's bill, H.R. 2276, the 
Federal Aviation Administration Revitalization Act of 1995. One 
difference between the two bills was that H.R. 2276 required 
that FAA's new personnel and procurement rules be submitted to 
Congress. If Congress did not like the new rules, legislation 
would have to be passed to change them. If Congress took no 
action, FAA's new personnel and procurement rules would have 
gone into effect. P.L. 104-50 did not require any Congressional 
approval.
                                ------                                


         ANTITERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996

    Public Law 104-132 covers a variety of provisions to 
support antiterrorism measures. Section 322 requires foreign 
airlines to have a security program which provides the same 
level of safety that is required of U.S. domestic airlines. 
Prior to this law, foreign airlines could have security 
programs which provided a similar level of safety. U.S. 
airlines believed the previous law allowed foreign airlines to 
provide a less secure system for U.S. travelers, which cost 
less and provided the foreign airline with a competitive 
advantage.
                                ------                                


               FEDERAL AVIATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996

    Public Law provides a 2-year authorization for three of the 
accounts in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and a 1-
year authorization for FAA's Research, Engineering, and 
Development (RE&D) account. The total authorization level was 
$19.5 billion for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Several other 
aviation bills were incorporated into this law addressing 
issues such as FAA reform, aviation security, aviation safety, 
pilot record sharing, child pilot safety, assistance to 
families of victims after aviation accidents, and the 
Metropolitan Washington Airports.
                                ------                                


        NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD AMENDMENTS OF 1996

    Public Law 104-291 reauthorizes the National Transportation 
Safety Board (NTSB) for 3 years with funding levels of $42.407 
million in 1997, $44.46 million for 1998, and $45.04 million 
for 1999. The law also makes several legislative changes which 
were originally requested by NTSB.
    The law permits NTSB to withhold foreign accident 
information from public disclosure. Before this law, foreign 
aviation authorities would not give accident information to 
NTSB for fear that the Board would have to release it under the 
Freedom of Information Act. As a result, Board employees had to 
travel to foreign countries or embassies to review data. This 
was inefficient and costly. The law allows NTSB to receive the 
data without having to release it. This will promote 
cooperation with foreign aviation safety authorities. It will 
not deny the public any information that is currently 
available. NTSB will use the data to make safety 
recommendations.
    The law also permits NTSB to withhold voluntarily-provided 
safety information. Before this law, NTSB would learn of safety 
problems only after an accident occurred. A major initiative in 
the aviation community is to try to spot trends or unsafe 
practices before they cause an accident. This would be 
accomplished by voluntarily sharing data among airlines and 
with the government. In the past, this effort was stymied by 
the airlines reluctance to share information with the 
government for fear that the government would then have to 
release it. Protecting voluntarily-provided safety information 
from public disclosure would not deny the public any 
information they now receive and could lead to safety 
improvements. This proposal was strongly supported by the FAA 
and the aviation community. (Similar provisions of law for the 
FAA were included in the Federal Aviation Revitalization Act.)
    The law also allows NTSB to conduct accident investigation 
classes and charge non-NTSB employees who attend. NTSB conducts 
classes for its employees. Sometimes States or foreign 
countries send employees for training. This law allows NTSB to 
charge outsiders for safety training and thereby recoup some of 
its costs.
                                ------                                


                           Other Legislation

       FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REVITALIZATION ACT OF 1995

    The Committee reported and the House passed H.R. 2276, to 
reform the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Portions of 
this bill were included in the Federal Aviation Reauthorization 
Act of 1996. This bill would reorganize FAA so that it would be 
independent of the Department of Transportation (DOT). In 
addition, the FAA would be run by a board and a chief executive 
officer, reflecting a structure similar to a private business. 
By reducing the amount of unnecessary management by DOT and 
restructuring FAA's management, this structure would allow FAA 
to run more efficiently and effectively. The bill would have 
established a Management Advisory Committee consisting of 
aviation industry and interested parties to provide advice and 
counsel to the Administration on issues regarding FAA and the 
industry. A similar advisory committee was included in the 
Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996.
    The bill would have removed DOT from FAA's rulemaking 
process, except in cases of regulations that would likely have 
a significant effect on other modes of transportation or the 
Secretary' aviation responsibilities.
    The bill would have reformed FAA' personnel system by 
exempting FAA from parts II and III of Title 5. FAA would have 
to establish its own personnel management system which would 
then have to be submitted to Congress for review. The goals of 
the new personnel management system would have to include: 
hiring and firing employees as in the private sector; promoting 
and paying employees based on merit; providing market-based 
salaries to attract the best qualified employees within 
available resources; and moving personnel to those facilities 
where they are most needed. Certain provisions of Title 5 were 
specifically identified as still pertaining to FAA' new 
personnel system, including: whistle-blower protection; 
veterans' preference; limitations on the right to strike; 
certain anti-discrimination provisions; and certain retirement, 
life insurance, and health insurance provisions.
    The bill would have also reformed FAA's procurement system 
by exempting FAA from parts of various procurement laws. 
Exemptions in the bill included: Title III of the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949; the Office of 
Federal Procurement Policy Act; the Federal Acquisition 
Streamlining Act of 1994; and the Small Business Act (except 
that the Administration shall provide reasonable opportunities 
to small business concerns). FAA would then have to establish 
its own procurement rules.
    The Department of Transportation and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-50) included provisions on 
procurement and personnel reforms very similar to those that 
appeared in H.R. 2276. Other portions of the bill, including 
the Management Advisory Committee, were included in the Federal 
Aviation Reauthorization Act (FARA) of 1996.

                          PILOT RECORD SHARING

    The Committee reported and the House passed H.R. 3536, to 
require airlines to request and receive the performance records 
of pilots they are interested in hiring. Although the vast 
majority of pilots are excellent, pilots whose performance may 
present a safety problem need to be weeded out. The bill would 
protect the public from pilots with questionable performance 
records. It was modified and included as Title V of the Federal 
Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, P.L. 104-264.

                         CHILD PILOT SAFETY ACT

    The Committee reported and the House passed H.R. 3267 which 
forbids someone without a pilots license from attempting to set 
a record or engage in aeronautical feats. This will ensure that 
children cannot be used to set aviation records. The bill was 
included as Title VI of the Federal Aviation Reauthorization 
Act of 1996, P.L. 104-264.

                AVIATION DISASTER FAMILY ASSISTANCE ACT

    The Committee reported and the House passed H.R. 3923 which 
requires that the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) 
act as a point of contact within the Federal Government for the 
families of passengers involved in an accident.
    After a major accident, NTSB will designate an independent 
non-profit agency, such as the American Red Cross, to have 
primary responsibility for coordinating the emotional care and 
support of the families of passengers involved in the accident.
    The bill requires that airlines provide the passenger 
manifest with the best available information to the non-profit 
organization designated for the accident if requested. The non-
profit organization can use the passenger manifest to help 
family members with information about their loved ones.
    The bill requires airlines to submit plans to DOT to 
address the needs of families of passengers involved in an 
airline accident. In addition, the bill establishes a task 
force to develop guidelines for such plans. The bill also 
prohibits unsolicited communication from lawyers to families of 
victims or passengers who were injured in an accident until 30 
days after the accident. This legislation, with minor changes, 
was included in the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act as 
Title VII.

        METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON AIRPORTS AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1995

    The Committee reported H.R. 1036. The bill was needed to 
address a constitutional problem with the Metropolitan 
Washington Airports Board of Review. This bill eliminates the 
Board of Review, adds four Presidential appointees to the 
airport board, replaces the Board of Review with a nine member 
Federal Advisory Commission, subjected to periodic 
congressional reauthorization the eight airport actions that 
were formerly subject to review by the Board of Review, freezes 
current airport regulations governing the Dulles access road, 
and liberalizes the slot rules at National Airport. A scaled 
down version of this bill was included in the Federal Aviation 
Reauthorization Act of 1996 as Title IX.
                                ------                                


                                Hearings

    During the 104th Congress, the Aviation Subcommittee held 
37 days of hearings covering 25 different topics. Many of these 
hearings related to legislation developed by the Subcommittee. 
Other hearings described below enabled the Subcommittee to 
carry out its oversight responsibilities.
    On February 1, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
ways to reduce Federal mandates and regulatory burdens on the 
aviation industry without affecting the safety of the traveling 
public. Representatives from airports and airlines testified at 
the hearing and offered examples of existing regulations whose 
costs were underestimated by DOT and FAA. FAA Administrator 
David Hinson testified that FAA is doing its best to estimate 
potential costs of regulations, but that improvements can 
always be made. A few weeks prior to the hearing, FAA requested 
public comments on what regulations could be examined and 
improved to reduce unnecessary burdens on the industry.
    On February 9, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the 
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board of Review. The 
Board of Review was found to be unconstitutional, so the 
hearing focused on the role of Congress regarding the two 
airports owned by the Federal Government; National and Dulles 
Airports.
    On February 14, 15, and 23, 1995, the Subcommittee held 
hearings on restructuring the air traffic control system as a 
private or government corporation. Over 3 days, many witnesses 
testified including representatives from DOT, the Air Line 
Pilots Association, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, and 
the German Air Traffic Control Corporation. Many of the 
witnesses and most of the members of Congress were more 
interested in making FAA an independent organization rather 
than a private corporation.
    On March 22, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the 
financial condition of the airline industry; present and 
future, focusing on the continuation of the fuel tax exemption. 
The airlines testified that they were paying several types of 
Federal taxes and they should not have to pay additional taxes 
to reduce the deficit. In addition, the airlines had 
experienced several years of losses and, therefore, they felt 
they should be exempted from an additional tax that could force 
some airlines into bankruptcy. DOT testified that the airlines' 
economic situation was improving and, therefore, they could pay 
the fuel tax without detrimental consequences.
    On May 11, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing entitled, 
``Denver Airport: What Went Wrong?'' The hearing looked at the 
original design and cost of the Denver Airport versus the 
actual costs and design. Witnesses included DOT and 
representatives from the Denver Airport. Denver airport 
representatives testified that flight delays were down due to 
the new airport. The automated baggage system was not fully 
operational, but the Denver airport representatives were 
confident that the airport would run smoothly even with the 
limited automated system.
    On May 18, 1995, the Subcommittee met in executive session 
for a briefing on aviation security and the FAA's anti-
terrorism program in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing.held 
hearings on
    On June 8 and November 30, 1995, the Subcommittee held 
hearings on preventing delays and cost overruns in the FAA's 
new global positioning (satellite navigation) system. The 
hearing included testimony from various members of the aviation 
industry, FAA, the Department of Defense, and Wilcox, the 
company that won the initial Wide Area Augmentation System 
(WAAS) contract. The government and Wilcox representatives 
assured the Subcommittee that the program was being managed 
properly and they were confident the project would run 
smoothly.
    On July 20, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
aviation relations between the United States and Japan. 
Witnesses included representatives from United Air Lines, 
Federal Express, and the General Aviation Manufacturers 
Association. The day after the hearing, DOT Secretary Pena 
announced that Japan had acknowledged the rights of U.S. cargo 
companies and that an agreement was imminent.
    On July 27, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
reasons for, and reporting of, airline flight delays. The 
hearing was held, in part, because DOT had changed its position 
on whether or not to report mechanical problems as a delay, or 
exclude delays caused by mechanical problems because of safety 
concerns. DOT testified at the hearing along with airline 
representatives and consumer representatives. DOT now includes 
delays due to mechanical problems in the on-time calculations.
    On September 26, 1995, the Subcommittee held a field 
hearing in Aurora, Illinois on computer outages at the FAA's 
air traffic control center. FAA air traffic control equipment 
had been experiencing several outages; some that left the 
controllers with limited information on their computers and 
other, more serious outages that left the controllers with only 
voice communication with aircraft. The Subcommittee heard from 
FAA, controllers, FAA employees that maintain the air traffic 
computers, and airline representatives. FAA will be replacing 
the failing equipment, but it may take years in some cases.
    On September 28, and October 11, 1995, the Subcommittee 
held hearings on H.R. 2276, the Federal Aviation Administration 
Revitalization Act. After the 3 days of hearings in February on 
restructuring the FAA and air traffic control, many members of 
the Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2276. This bill would make FAA 
independent of DOT; would establish a new personnel and 
procurement system to make FAA more effective and efficient; 
and reorganize FAA to be run by a board and a Chief Executive 
Officer similar to a business. Witnesses included 
representatives from the Aircraft Owners and Pilots 
Association, the air traffic controllers union, the Association 
of Flight Attendants, the airlines, and DOT. Most supported the 
bill.
    On October 19 and December 7, 1995, the Subcommittee held 
hearings on the regulation of public aircraft and on H.R. 1320, 
the Special Purpose Aircraft Safety Act. Prior to 1994, 
government agencies operated their aircraft without having to 
comply with certain Federal regulations. Legislation passed in 
1994 changed the definition of a public aircraft which forced 
many State and local agencies to comply with FAA rules when 
their planes carry people for transport; not for certain types 
of duties, such as fire fighting. The hearing allowed many 
witnesses to testify about the difficulties of the change in 
law and how the law was imposing significant costs on certain 
State and local governments.
    On November 9, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
FAA's Expanded East Coast Plan. In an attempt to increase 
capacity, improve safety, and reduce delays, the FAA altered 
the flight patterns of aircraft in the East Coast in 1987. The 
change in flight paths created increased aircraft noise for 
residents in New Jersey and New York. The hearing provided an 
opportunity for several members of Congress and local residents 
to testify about their problems with aircraft noise. FAA also 
testified at the hearing.
    On December 13 and 14, 1995, the Subcommittee held hearings 
on aviation safety and whether airlines should be required to 
share pilot performance records. At the time of the hearing, 
airlines did not have to share a pilot's record when hiring. 
The hearings allowed representatives from airlines, the 
National Transportation Safety Board, FAA, and pilot unions to 
discuss the pros and cons of record sharing and how best to 
develop legislation requiring pilot record sharing. Legislation 
regarding this subject was included in the Federal Aviation 
Authorization Act of 1996.
    On February 29, March 7, 13,14, and 20, 1996, the 
Subcommittee held hearings on the reauthorization of the 
Airport Improvement Program and the FAA. On February 29, the 
hearing addressed the pros and cons of privatizing airports. On 
March 7, the hearing focused on airport revenue diversion. On 
March 13, the hearing focused on airport needs. On March 14, 
the hearing addressed the State block grant program which 
allows States to distribute and administer Airport Improvement 
Grants to general aviation airports. On March 20, the hearing 
provided an opportunity for FAA to testify about FAA 
reauthorization issues and other miscellaneous items. These 
hearings helped to shape the Federal Aviation Reauthorization 
Act of 1996.
    On March 6, 1996, the Aviation Subcommittee and the 
Railroad Subcommittee held a joint hearing on the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The hearing was part of the 
Committee's general oversight effort and ultimately led to 
legislation reauthorizing that agency. The Subcommittee heard 
testimony from NTSB Chairman Jim Hall and other top agency 
officials.
    On March 18, 1996, the Subcommittee held a field hearing in 
Des Moines, Washington, on the proposed third runway at the 
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The hearing allowed 
representatives from the airport, airlines, and the surrounding 
communities to testify about the potential impacts of building 
the third runway.
    On March 27 and April 30, 1996, the Subcommittee held 
hearings on problems in the United States aviation relationship 
with the United Kingdom and Japan. The concerns discussed at 
the hearing included the fifth freedom rights from Japan. The 
lack of slots and the desire to have open skies with the United 
Kingdom were also discussed. The hearing allowed airline 
representatives to voice their opinions on these issues.
    On May 1, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 
3267, the Child Pilot Safety Act. After the tragic death of 7-
year-old Jessica Dubroff, her father, and a flight instructor, 
while they were trying to make Jessica the youngest person to 
fly across the country, the Subcommittee held a hearing to 
discuss the possibility of protecting children from unnecessary 
aviation accidents. The hearing allowed pilots and other 
interested parties to discuss the pros and cons of limiting 
children from participating in flying general aviation 
aircraft. A bill was introduced on the subject and incorporated 
into the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996.
    On May 29, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the 
high-performance take-offs by military aircraft at civilian 
airports. This hearing was held after a serious accident 
occurred on January 29, 1996. A U.S. Navy air crew was 
preparing to depart on a cross-country flight in their F-14 
Tomcat from Nashville International Airport to Miramar Naval 
Air Station in San Diego, California. Shortly after take-off, 
the F-14 crashed into a residential community killing the 
pilot, his radar intercept officer, and three individuals who 
were inside a home. The hearing offered an opportunity to 
discuss the potential problems of high-performance take-offs.
    On June 19, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the 
treatment of families after airline accidents. The hearing 
allowed families that had lost loved ones due to airline 
accidents to testify about their interaction with the airlines 
and how improvements could be made. The hearing also allowed 
the airlines and the National Transportation Safety Board to 
comment on potential approaches to improve the treatment of 
families after airline accidents.
    On June 25, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
aviation safety and specifically on issues raised by the crash 
of ValuJet Flight 592. ValuJet is a new entrant airline known 
for its competitive air fares. ValuJet had experienced several 
minor incidents, but did not have a major accident until Flight 
592. The hearing focused on the possible cause of the accident, 
and ValuJet's ability to operate safely. FAA conducted an 
extensive investigation of ValuJet and decided to ground the 
airline. ValuJet is now operating again with a limited number 
of aircraft.
    On July 10, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 
3187, the Aviation Safety Protection Act. The hearing focused 
on whether or not airline employees should have whistle blower 
protection. Witnesses who work for airlines testified that 
without whistle blower protection, the employees would lose 
their jobs if they reported a potential safety violation.
    On July 16, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 
969, the Airliner Cabin Air Quality Act. Witnesses testified 
for and against banning smoking on international flights. 
Currently, smoking is banned on most domestic flights.
    On August 1, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 
1309, regarding child safety restraint system requirements on 
commercial aircraft. Currently, children under 2 years old may 
sit on an adult's lap during a flight for no additional charge. 
Representatives from the National Transportation Safety Board 
and flight attendant unions testified in favor of requiring 
child safety restraint systems on board aircraft. 
Representatives from the FAA testified that according to their 
studies if families were required to purchase seats for 
infants, the additional cost would force some families to drive 
instead of fly, placing the entire family at higher risk.
    On September 5, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
H.R. 3923, the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act. After 
the hearing on June 19 regarding the treatment of families 
after airline accidents, the Subcommittee introduced 
legislation on this issue. The September 5th hearing allowed 
family members to comment on ways the legislation could be 
improved. The FAA reauthorization bill did include language on 
improving the treatment of families of victims of aviation 
accidents based on the testimony received.
    On September 11, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
aviation security and anti-terrorism. The hearing was, in part, 
a reaction to the TWA accident where investigators originally 
suspected terrorism as the cause. The airlines, airports, bomb 
detection companies, and a British airport representative 
testified on ways to improve aviation safety. Part of the 
hearing was conducted in executive session.
 SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME 
                             TRANSPORTATION

    During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee on Coast Guard 
and Maritime Transportation, Chaired by Congressman Howard 
Coble with Congressman James A. Traficant, Jr., and later 
Congressman Bob Clement, serving as Ranking Minority Members, 
developed major legislation dealing with the U.S. Coast Guard 
and U.S. Federal Maritime Commission. This legislation involved 
the Coast Guard's responsibilities to ensure safety of life and 
property at sea, enforce all Federal laws on the high seas and 
U.S. waters, maintain aids to navigation, protect the marine 
environment, and ensure the safety and security of vessel, 
ports, waterways, and related facilities. Major legislation to 
eliminate the Federal Maritime Commission and deregulate 
international ocean shipping was also developed. The Federal 
laws amended under these initiatives include the Oil Pollution 
Act of 1990, the Shipping Act of 1984, the Deepwater Port Act 
of 1974, the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and 
Control Act of 1990, and many other miscellaneous laws. The 
Subcommittee held oversight hearings on the President's 
National Drug Control Strategy and drug interdiction, the Coast 
Guard's vessel traffic service systems, and the Coast Guard 
acquisitions, research and development, and icebreaking 
missions. During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee also held 
oversight hearings on the natural resource damages assessment 
regulations implemented under ``Superfund'' and the Oil 
Pollution Act, the impact of U.S. coastwise trade laws (``Jones 
Act'') on the transportation system in the United States, and 
the Federal requirements for evidence of financial 
responsibility for oil spill liability under the Oil Pollution 
Act.
                                ------                                


                          Enacted Legislation

    (For a more detailed desription pof the enacted 
legislation, see the ``Bills Enacted into Law'' section.)

       ALASKA POWER ADMINISTRATION ASSET SALE AND TERMINATION ACT

    The primary purpose of Public Law 104-58 is to authorize 
the export of Alaska North Slope crude oil and to authorize the 
Secretary of Energy to sell the Alaska Power Administration. 
The Act requires vessels carrying Alaska North Slope crude oil 
to be carried aboard U.S.-flag, U.S. manned vessels.
    Title IV of this Act requires that the Commandant of the 
Coast Guard submit to Congress a plan on the most cost 
effective means of implementing an international private-sector 
tug-of-opportunity system. This plan must utilize existing 
towing vessels to provide emergency response services to any 
vessel in distress transiting the waters within the boundaries 
of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary of the Strait of 
Juan de Fuca.
                                ------                                


         INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION TERMINATION ACT OF 1995

                          (Public Law 104-88)

    The primary purpose of the Interstate Commerce Commission 
(ICC) Termination Act of 1995 was to terminate the ICC and 
transfer its remaining functions to a new Surface 
Transportation Board within the Department of Transportation, 
effective January 1, 1996.
    Subchapter II of chapter 135 of the Act transferred to the 
Secretary of Transportation and the Surface Transportation 
Board the jurisdiction of the ICC over water carrier 
transportation. The jurisdiction was expanded to include port-
to-port water carrier transportation and transportation to the 
U.S. territories that has been regulated by the Federal 
Maritime Commission (FMC).
    Title IV of the ICC Termination Act includes a requirement 
for the Secretary of Transportation to complete a study of the 
noncontiguous domestic trades within 6 months of enactment of 
this Act to analyze the competition and rate structure in the 
trades, the impact of tariff filing on the trades, the problems 
of parallel pricing and its impact in the domestic trades, 
whether additional protections are needed to protect shippers 
from the abuse of market power, and whether additional 
legislative changes are necessary.
                                ------                                


        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996

    Public Law 104-106 contains several provisions to bring 
Coast Guard personnel benefits and other matters into line with 
those of the Department of Defense.
                                ------                                


        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997

    Public Law 104-201 contains several provisions to bring 
Coast Guard personnel benefits and other matters into line with 
those of the Department of Defense. The Act also includes a 
requirement that the Secretary of Transportation certify that 
all funds transferred from the Secretary of Defense to the 
Coast Guard are used for national defense purposes.
                                ------                                


                 COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1996

    The primary purpose of Public Law 104-324 is to authorize 
the expenditures of the U.S. Coast Guard for fiscal years 1996 
and 1997. The Act authorizes the portion of the Coast Guard 
budget that requires an authorization at the level of $3.9 
billion in fiscal year 1997, as requested by the President.
    This public law also contains provisions relating to the 
illegal drug interdiction mission of the Coast Guard; marine 
safety and waterways services management; the Deepwater Port 
Modernization Act; the Coast Guard Regulatory Reform Act; 
implementation of international tonnage measurement (ITC) 
requirements; the prevention of plastics pollution from ships; 
the conveyance of various Coast Guard lighthouses and other 
excess properties; and amendments to the Oil Pollution Act of 
1990.
                                ------                                


                 NATIONAL INVASIVE SPECIES ACT OF 1996

    Public Law 104-332 reauthorizes and amends the 
Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 
1990 (NANPCA). NANPCA establishes a program for preventing, 
researching, monitoring and controlling infestations of 
nonindigenous aquatic species as well as set up the Aquatic 
Nuisance Species Task Force to develop and oversee the program. 
It also creates the Great Lakes Aquatic Nuisance Species Panel 
to help coordinate Federal, state, local and private efforts 
concerning nonindigenous species within the Great Lakes basin. 
NANPCA requires the Coast Guard to establish voluntary ballast 
water exchange guidelines for the Great Lakes which later 
became mandatory.
    This Act reauthorizes the NANPCA through the year 2002 and 
amends NANPCA to establish a national ballast water management 
program to address concerns about the unintentional 
introductions of aquatic nuisance species in many parts of the 
country. Currently, the exchange of ballast water on the high 
seas is the primary method to prevent the introduction of alien 
species into U.S. waters. Under this Act, the Coast Guard must 
establish voluntary ballast water exchange guidelines which may 
become mandatory for certain vessels throughout the United 
States.

                           Other Legislation

                 THE OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT OF 1995

    During the Second Session of the 104th Congress, the House 
of Representatives passed H.R. 2149, the Ocean Shipping Reform 
Act of 1995. H.R. 2149 deregulates international ocean shipping 
and eliminates the need for the Federal Maritime Commission. 
This bill would lower ocean shipping costs for American 
exporters and importers, increase the flow of cargo through our 
ports, improve our competitive position in the world, and keep 
jobs in this country.
    Specifically, H.R. 2149 authorizes private contracts for 
ocean transportation, as provided in all other areas of 
transportation, eliminates tariffs and tariff enforcement, 
preserves common carriage for all sizes of shippers, and 
strengthens the laws related to unfair trade practices. This 
legislation also substantially weakens the ability of the ocean 
shipping conferences to control U.S. shipping rates by removing 
government enforcement of the conference rates, or tariffs, and 
by removing the authority of the conferences to require 
individual carriers to divulge their private contractual 
negotiations with U.S. businesses.
    The Senate failed to act on the House-passed bill.
                                ------                                


                                Hearings

    During the 104th Congress, the Coast Guard and Maritime 
Transportation Subcommittee, chaired by Congressman Howard 
Coble, with Congressman James A. Traficant, Jr., and later 
Congressman Bob Clement, serving as Ranking Minority Members, 
held 15 hearings and other meetings. Many of the Subcommittee 
hearings related to legislation developed by the Subcommittee. 
Other hearings described below, covered a wide variety of 
issues involving the U.S. Coast Guard, the President's National 
Drug Control policy, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and water 
transportation in general.

                        The Shipping Act of 1984

    On February 2, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing to 
determine whether the current regulatory scheme governing ocean 
common carriage in the foreign commerce of the United States 
should be reformed to provide a greater degree of competition 
in ocean shipping. The Subcommittee received testimony from a 
wide variety of witnesses representing all facets of the ocean 
shipping industry.
    The first panel of witnesses represented small, medium, and 
large businesses that ship goods by water in international 
commerce. These witnesses testified about their problems with 
the current U.S. system which governs international ocean 
shipping, and highlighted some of the reasons they support 
elimination of U.S. economic regulation of the ocean liner 
industry. Specifically, the witnesses on this panel testified 
in favor of a repeal of U.S. laws granting antitrust immunity 
for ocean carriers to collectively set rates and restrict 
capacity. They also stated that the Federal Maritime Commission 
(FMC) has failed to adequately protect U.S. shippers under the 
current ocean shipping regime. Shippers on this panel testified 
in favor of repealing the prohibition against shippers and 
carriers signing confidential contracts, and in favor of 
elimination of the requirement for ocean carriers to file 
tariffs, or rates, with the FMC. One witness representing a 
single company on the west coast testified in favor of the 
current system of international ocean shipping.
    The second panel of witnesses represented U.S. and foreign 
liner operators. These witnesses testified in strong support of 
the current system of ocean shipping regulation under the 
Shipping Act of 1984. This panel agreed that abolishing the FMC 
and antitrust immunity for ocean carriers would promote 
significant rate instability, discourage investment in the 
ocean shipping industry, and place U.S. carriers at a 
competitive disadvantage with foreign ocean carriers.
    On the third panel of witnesses were representatives of 
freight ``intermediaries'', including ocean freight forwarders, 
non-vessel operating common carriers, and customs brokers. 
These witnesses described their suggestions for reform of the 
current system of ocean shipping regulation, including 
abolishing the distinction between freight forwarders and non-
vessel operating common carriers and abolishing tariff filing. 
One of these witnesses testified in favor of retaining 
antitrust immunity for ocean carriers.
    Also on the third panel were a witness representing U.S. 
ports and two witnesses who were former commissioners of the 
FMC. The witness representing U.S. ports testified in support 
of retaining the current system of ocean shipping regulation. 
One of the former FMC commissioners testified in favor of the 
current regulatory regime under the Shipping Act of 1984, and 
the other former commissioner testified in favor of reform of 
the current system.
    The only witness on the fourth panel was William Hathaway, 
Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission. Chairman Hathaway 
argued against repeal of the Shipping Act of 1984, in 
particular, the antitrust exemption. He also testified that the 
FMC should remain an independent agency for the predictability, 
the stability, and the perception by foreign governments that 
the maritime laws of the U.S. are not being administered by the 
White House or by an executive agency, but rather by an 
independent agency.

                     Vessel Traffic Service Systems

    The Subcommittee held a series of hearings to consider 
whether any of the Coast Guard missions should be performed 
differently, or even eliminated, to improve the overall level 
of Coast Guard service to the public. The first of this series 
of hearings occurred on June 29, 1995, when the Subcommittee 
examined the Coast Guard's Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) 2000 
initiative, and considered whether the private sector should be 
involved to a greater extent in providing vessel traffic 
information services (VTIS). Testimony was received from the 
U.S. Coast Guard, port authority officials, marine pilots, a 
private VTIS system in the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, 
ocean going vessel operators, and inland vessel operators. The 
Coast Guard reported on its progress with the VTS 2000 
procurement and its opposition to changing user fees to finance 
VTS systems. The Coast Guard views VTS services as an 
inherently government function which should be financed by tax 
dollars. The Marine Exchange of Los Angeles and Long Beach 
Harbor, which operates the private vessel traffic information 
service (VTIS) system in Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbor, 
reported about the success of its VTIS system which is 
supported by a specific harbor user fee related to VTIS use. 
Several vessel operators, who use the private system in Los 
Angeles, reported their satisfaction with the privately run 
system. Inland vessel operators expressed their dissatisfaction 
with the Coast Guard's plans for its new VTS-2000 system. These 
operators felt the new systems would not result in a 
significant increase in safety, but will result in a very large 
public cost. These groups were very much opposed to user fees 
to pay for a system that they believe may be unnecessary in 
many ports.
    Due to the Subcommittee's concerns about the issue, 
Chairman Coble and Ranking Member Traficant asked the General 
Accounting Office (GAO) to determine the degree to which 
parties with an interest in marine transportation have a level 
of interest in acquiring and funding VTS systems. GAO was also 
asked to assess the key issues which could affect the 
establishment of alternatively funded VTS systems. The Coast 
Guard also contracted with the Marine Board of the National 
Academy of Sciences to examine the issue of marine information 
systems in general. Due to the concerns raised at our hearing 
and the results of these two independent studies, the 
conference report to the fiscal year 1997 Department of 
Transportation appropriations bill prohibited funds for 
continuing the VTS 2000 program. The appropriations law does 
give the Coast Guard one million dollars to propose a viable 
new production program, supported by local communities, which 
will provide near-term safety benefits.

      Natural Resource Damages under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990

    On July 7, 1995, the Subcommittee held a joint hearing with 
the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee regarding the 
implementation of the natural resource damages programs under 
the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and 
Liability Act of 1980 (Superfund) and the Oil Pollution Act of 
1990 and considered comments on the fairness, effectiveness, 
and efficiency of these programs. Under Superfund and the Oil 
Pollution Act, trustees of publicly owned natural resources may 
seek recovery of injury to those resources caused by the 
release of hazardous substances or oil. The hearing focused on 
serious concerns about how natural resource damages should be 
estimated, what releases should trigger liability, and how the 
trustees may use any monies they receive as part of a claim. 
The four natural resource damages issues of particular concern 
are the measurement of use and non-use damages, retroactive 
liability, caps on damages, and rebuttable presumption.
    The first panel of witnesses represented several Federal 
and State agencies which deal with the natural resource damage 
issue including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, the U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. 
Department of Justice, and the States of New Jersey and New 
Mexico. These agencies represent Federal and State natural 
resources trustees. These trustees are responsible for 
restoring injured natural resources which result from the 
spilling of oil or hazardous substances. The Federal witnesses 
testified that the Administration strongly supports the current 
system of natural resource damage liability.
    During the last two panels, the Subcommittees heard from 
companies that have been subject to or affected by natural 
resource damage claims, the environmental community, and 
experts who have been on both sides of the claims process. The 
Coalition for Legislative Natural Resource Damage Reform 
testified that the natural resource damage program must be 
reformed before it bankrupts industry and the government by 
creating huge financial liabilities. The Natural Resources 
Defense Council testified that it strongly supports the natural 
resource damage recovery provisions of both Superfund and the 
Oil Pollution Act.

                     National Drug Control Strategy

    On August 1, 1995, and on September 12, 1996, the 
Subcommittee held hearings to examine the effectiveness of the 
Administration's National Drug Control Strategy in controlling 
the use of illegal drugs in this country, and specifically the 
Coast Guard's drug interdiction program. The 1995 hearing heard 
from the U.S. Coast Guard, Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, several other Federal agencies which are involved in 
controlling the flow of illicit drugs, and several private 
witnesses were critical of the Administration's drug control 
policies. The 1996 hearing was a joint hearing with the Senate 
Caucus on International Narcotics Control and focused on drug 
interdiction and other matters related to the National Drug 
Control Policy. The Subcommittee and the Caucus received 
testimony from the Coast Guard, Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Customs 
Service, the Department of State, and several private 
witnesses. While the Administration's witnesses strongly 
supported the President's policies, John Walters, former Deputy 
Director for Supply Reduction of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, argued that after a decade of consistent 
progress, almost every available indicator today shows that the 
United States is losing the struggle against illegal drugs.

                        Coast Guard Acquisitions

    On May 9, 1996, the Subcommittee held an oversight hearing 
to review the Coast Guard's policies and procedures relating to 
the Coast Guard's capital acquisition program, its research and 
development program, as well as its domestic and international 
icebreaking activities. The Coast Guard discussed its current 
proposals for these programs, and also informed the 
Subcommittee about the Coast Guard's long-range plans for these 
areas. Several witnesses, including representatives from the 
Lake Carriers Association, Great Lakes ports, and maritime 
labor, testified about the importance of continuing the Coast 
Guard's icebreaking mission on the Great Lakes.

                               Jones Act

    On June 12, 1996, the Subcommittee held an extensive 
hearing about the impact of U.S. coastwise trade laws on the 
transportation system in the United States. These laws are 
referred to as cabotage laws, or simply, the ``Jones Act'', 
after its chief sponsor, Senator Wesley Jones. The Jones Act 
requires that no merchandise may be transported by water, or by 
land and water, between U.S. ports or points, either directly 
or by a foreign port, or for any part of the transportation, in 
any vessel except one that was built in the U.S., owned by U.S. 
citizens (corporate ownership must be 75 percent U.S.-owned), 
and documented under U.S. law.
    The Subcommittee heard from five panels of witnesses. The 
first panel included Federal government witnesses including the 
U.S. Maritime Administration, which strongly supports the Jones 
Act, the U.S. Customs Service, and the U.S. International Trade 
Commission, which has issued an analysis of the Jones Act's 
economic effects. The second panel included witnesses who 
support reforms of the Jones Act. These included 
representatives from the Jones Act Reform Coalition, the 
American Farm Bureau, the National Cattleman Beef Association, 
and several private businesses. These witnesses argued that the 
Jones Act greatly increases U.S. water transportation costs and 
has left the U.S. with only a small and aging deepwater fleet. 
The third panel represented U.S. inland and ocean going vessel 
operators who are strongly opposed to amending U.S. coastwise 
trade laws. These witnesses included representatives from 
Matson Navigation, SeaLand, the American Waterways Operators, 
and the Lake Carriers Association. These witnesses argued that 
U.S. cabotage laws are vital to safety on our waterways, 
crucial to U.S. national defense, and provide for a competitive 
balance in the transportation system. The fourth panel included 
witnesses representing U.S. maritime labor unions and U.S. 
shipyards which also support the retention of U.S. coastwise 
trade laws. The fifth panel included witnesses who represented 
the Steel Manufacturers Association, the Governor of Guam, the 
Puerto Rico Jones Act Reform Coalition, and a U.S. maritime 
company. These witnesses supported reforms to the Jones Act and 
testified that these laws greatly increase water shipping costs 
and prevent water transportation from effectively competing 
with railroads and trucks.

      Financial Responsibility under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990

    On June 26, 1996, the Subcommittee held an oversight 
hearing about the Federal requirements for vessels to obtain 
certificates of financial responsibility (COFRs) mandated by 
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). The hearing focused on 
the effectiveness of the Coast Guard's regulations in 
implementing the OPA 90 COFR requirement, and whether the Coast 
Guard's regulations provide additional coverage for oil 
pollution liability. OPA 90 created a comprehensive national 
scheme to compensate victims of oil spills for a broad range of 
environmental damages, to prevent future oil spills in U.S. 
waters, to clean up oil spills that do occur, and to punish 
those who cause oil spills. OPA 90 imposes liability for oil 
discharges from any source, including U.S.-flag and foreign-
flag vessels, onshore and offshore facilities, pipelines, and 
deepwater ports. The Coast Guard regulations that implement the 
OPA 90 COFR requirement provide that financial responsibility 
can be established by insurance, surety bond guarantee, self-
insurance, or a combination of the four.
    The Subcommittee heard from two panels of witnesses during 
the COFR hearing. On the first panel Daniel Sheehan, Director 
of the Coast Guard's National Pollution Funds Center which 
wrote and implemented the Coast Guard's regulations, testified 
that implementation of the COFR rule was very smooth, and that 
the annual cost of obtaining COFRs for oceangoing vessels of 
private shipping interests has been approximately $70 million 
in gross combined annual premiums. Mr. Sheehan pointed out that 
this amount is only about fifteen percent of the worst-case 
scenario of $450 million identified by the Department of 
Transportation in the final regulatory impact analysis.
    The second panel of witnesses included representatives from 
the Water Quality Insurance Syndicate, the American Institute 
of Marine Underwriters, the International Chamber of Shipping, 
the International Association of Independent Tankers Owners, 
and a U.S. vessel operator. These witnesses, who represent the 
international shipping community and insurance industry, 
testified about their dissatisfaction with Coast Guard's 
regulations. The industry believes that the U.S. should join 
the international regime for oil spill liability established by 
the 1992 International Oil Spill Protocols which significantly 
increased the limits of oil spill compensation. The shipping 
industry also believes that the direct action provision in OPA 
90 greatly increases the cost of obtaining a COFR since the 
Protection and Indemnity Clubs, the traditional maritime 
insurers, have refused to issue COFRs due to concerns about 
unlimited liability. These witnesses also testified that the 
$70 million cost of this Federal requirement imposes a 
significant expense on the industry while adding little or no 
additional oil spill protection to the U.S. public.
 SUMMARY OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND 
                          ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

    During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee on Public 
Buildings and Economic Development was chaired by Republican 
Congressman Wayne T. Gilchrest with Congressman James A. 
Traficant, Jr. serving as ranking Democrat Member. The 
Subcommittee held numerous hearings on a variety of issues, 
including the General Services Administration Capital 
Improvement Program, and the U.S. Court Construction Program, 
procurement issues as a result of the Oklahoma City bombing, 
security issues, sale of a House office building, construction 
of a Smithsonian Air and Space Museum Annex, construction of a 
Capitol visitor's center, numerous naming bills of Federal 
buildings, and numerous requests for the use of the Capitol 
Grounds. The Subcommittee began an in-depth review of GSA's 
leasing program including oversight hearings on the delegation 
of leasing authority by GSA.

    H.R. 3576 would designate the United States Courthouse in 
South Bend, Indiana, as the ``Robert K. Rodibaugh Bankruptcy 
Courthouse''. Judge Rodibaugh was appointed as United States 
Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of Indiana in 1960. 
On August 30, 1995, he was appointed Chief Bankruptcy Judge for 
that region. During Judge Rodibaugh's tenure, he oversaw growth 
in both the number of courtrooms and employees within his 
district. Judge Rodibaugh has fulfilled his duties as a 
Bankruptcy Judge with patience, fairness, dedication and legal

                  Economic Development Partnership Act

    The Committee reported H.R. 2145, to reauthorize and reform 
the programs of the Economic Development Administration (EDA) 
and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) for 5 years. The 
legislation improved the program delivery and decisions, 
focused funds on cost-effective programs in truly distressed 
areas, and contributed to deficit reduction. This legislation 
continued a commitment by the Federal government to assist 
distressed communities through locally derived projects meeting 
local needs, improving the capacity for economic growth and 
creating employment within distressed communities. Furthermore, 
H.R. 2145 helped meet the needs of communities facing the 
effects of defense downsizing and base closuRes. The 
legislation continued EDA and ARC successes, utilizing an 
atmosphere in which Federal, State, and local officials work 
cooperatively, thereby reducing bureaucracy and enhancing the 
regional approach to problem solving in order to provide a 
greater accountability for project decisions. This ensures that 
the best projects are selected for investment. The Committee 
also concluded that there remained a need for a separate 
regional commission to administer the programs of the ARC due 
to continued economic distress in Appalachia.
                                ------                                


                                Hearings

    On February 10 and 22, 1995, the Subcommittee held hearings 
on the reauthorization of the Economic Development 
Administration and the Appalachian Regional Development Act. In 
conducting oversight over both the Economic Development 
Administration and the Appalachian Regional Commission, the 
Committee heard strong endorsements in favor of the commission 
approach utilized by the ARC as a model program for State-
Federal cooperation. Supportive testimony was received from the 
13 Governors of States within the jurisdiction of the ARC. On a 
bipartisan basis, they unanimously supported the ARC model. The 
Committee also heard testimony from local government officials 
and business people on the continued need of EDA programs to 
provide Federal assistance to areas suffering economic distress 
and from the effects of defense downsizing and base closures 
and realignment.
    On March 2, 6, and 9, 1995, the Subcommittee held hearings 
on the General Services Administration's capital investment 
plan, reform legislation, and related matters. The purpose of 
these hearings was two-fold; one, to examine GSA's basic 
authority to manage the Federal government's real estate, and 
two, to review GSA's FY 1996 request for new construction, 
repair and alteration to existing Federal buildings, and any 
request for advance design for future projects. The first 
hearing was devoted to legislative reform of GSA's basic 
authority under the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended, 
which was last reviewed in 1988. The second day was devoted to 
a review of GSA's FY 1996 capital improvement program. The 
requested amounts were $1.022 billion to construct new 
buildings, of which over $630 million was for the construction 
of new courthouses and $911 million to repair existing 
buildings. The Subcommittee also heard from private sector 
witnesses on ways to improve real property asset management.
    On June 15, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
various naming bills and H.R. 308, the Hopewell Township 
Investment Act. The purpose of this hearing was to inform the 
Subcommittee about the individuals for whom the buildings were 
to be named and to discuss the specifics of the land transfer 
in Hopewell Township.
    On June 22, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 
1230, the Capitol Visitor Center to be constructed under the 
East Plaza of the United States Capitol. The Capitol was never 
designed to adequately accommodate the growing influx of 
visitors. There is a lack of amenities such as cafeteria 
services, restrooms, telephones, or any organized educational 
assistance. In the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 
1991, funds were provided to the Architect of the Capitol for 
the conceptual design and planning for a Capitol Visitor 
Center. This hearing focused on the various design and 
construction aspects of the center, the financing of 
construction and related matters.
    On July 20, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the 
GSA court construction program. The Committee had deferred 
taking action on approving the FY 1996 courthouse construction 
program, because of concerns about the cost of courthouse 
construction, and the size of the facilities and the finishes 
that tended to add costs to already costly projects. The 
Subcommittee expressed an interest in greater sharing of 
facilities by the Courts, and urged the Judicial Conference to 
revise its Design Guide to reflect modern building constraints. 
This review continued through the 104th Congress. The 
Subcommittee held additional hearings on courthouse 
construction in 1995 and 1996.
    On July 27, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on GSA's 
leasing program and focused on the request to consolidate the 
Patent and Trademark office, which will result in the 
government leasing over 2 million square feet of space to house 
the PTO.
    On October 26, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the 
sale of 501 1st Street, an annex to the House Complex. The 
purpose of the hearing was to provide an opportunity for 
proponents of this action to urge approval of legislation 
authorizing the sale of the property. Witnesses included 
Members of Congress, the Architect of the Capitol and local 
residents.
    On April 17, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the 
payment of stipends to bidders relating to the construction of 
Federal buildings. During the House consideration of H.R. 1670, 
the Procurement Reform Act of 1995, an amendment was adopted 
which created a two-step process for design-build projects for 
Federal buildings. One part of this original amendment 
authorized the payment of stipends to bidders. This provision 
was ultimately dropped, with the understanding that the 
Subcommittee would review that proposal. The hearing provided 
the opportunity for proponents of the stipend measure to 
express views on the matter. Witnesses from GSA were joined by 
witnesses from the private sector, providing expert commentary 
on the issue. To date, GSA has paid over $700,000 to bidders in 
connection with three projects under existing authority.
    On April 24, 1996, the Subcommittee held an oversight 
hearing on Federal building security measures that have been 
instituted since the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In the year since that tragic event, 
the Federal Government had reviewed security measures in public 
facilities and had released a report on ``Vulnerability 
Assessment of Federal Facilities''. The Administration 
recommended spending $280 million on improving security in 
Federal facilities, including $40 million for new courthouses 
and modifications to existing Federal buildings. The 
Subcommittee heard from the FBI, Secret Service, Marshals 
Service, as well as GSA, on measures underway to protect 
Federal facilities.
    During the Second Session of the 104th Congress, the 
Subcommittee initiated a review of GSA's leasing program. GSA 
had embarked upon an internal review of its program and hired a 
consultant to analyze the cost of operation of leasing as 
compared with private sector leasing costs. While the 
consultant found that GSA was competitive in its leasing 
program, an effort was made to contract out certain aspects of 
the leasing program. That effort was opposed by the 
Subcommittee, until GSA demonstrated that it would achieve 
savings, promote efficiency or save time by contracting out 
these functions.
    During July 1996, the Subcommittee held hearings on GSA's 
leasing program. By then, GSA had taken a new approach to its 
leasing program and was structuring a plan to offer Federal 
agencies a choice of using GSA to continue leasing space for 
agency needs, or delegate the leasing authority to agencies 
upon demand. During the hearings the Subcommittee heard from 
the Department of the Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM), a 
non-appropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI), regarding a lease 
award where the Navy had no authority to enter into the lease, 
but GSA provided a retroactive delegation of leasing authority. 
In November 1994, Congresswoman Susan Molinari wrote to Navy 
Secretary Dalton raising serious concerns about this lease. The 
Department of the Navy opened a review of this lease 
transaction. The fundamental question was whether or not NAFIs 
have leasing authority. The purpose of this hearing was to 
focus on what officials did during this series of events, when 
they did it, and, why it had taken so long to respond to 
concerns raised by Congresswoman Molinari.
    On September 11, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on 
H.R. 1995, a bill to authorize construction of the Smithsonian 
Institution National Air and Space Museum Dulles Center at 
Washington-Dulles International Airport. Public Law 103-57 
authorized the Smithsonian Institution to plan and design an 
Air and Space Museum extension at Dulles International Airport. 
S. 1995 authorized construction of this facility without the 
use of Federal funds. The purpose of this hearing was to learn 
more about plans to pay for the facility, its construction 
details, and the commitment of the Commonwealth of Virginia to 
aid in the facility's development.

                              Site Visits

    On April 19, 1995, a home-made bomb exploded outside the 
Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 
persons, and causing damage to 320 buildings in the area at an 
estimated cost of $500 million. This act of domestic terrorism 
was the worst in modern U.S. history. Two days after this 
event, the Chairman of the Committee decided to personally 
visit the site and meet with local and Federal officials in 
Oklahoma City. After touring the devastation, the Chairman 
committed to help in any way, and sponsored a resolution 
directing GSA to survey Federal space in Oklahoma City with a 
specific focus on the continuing need to house agencies 
displaced by the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building. The 
resolution, passed May 3, 1995, also requested GSA to review 
security for Federal personnel affected by this event.
    In conjunction with the Subcommittee review of the GSA 
courthouse construction program, Subcommittee staff conducted 
site visits to several recently completed projects and also 
visited cities where court projects were being requested. A 
total of 9 site visits were made. The results of theses visits 
were summarized in a staff report which concluded that the 
procedure GSA and the Courts followed to select courthouse 
projects often results in courthouses that are either 
unnecessary or excessive. The problems identified in the report 
were due to the lack of detail in prospectuses; the flexible 
nature of the U.S. Courts Design Guide, permitting wide 
variance in design, features and finishes of a project; the 
lack of priority setting by the Courts; and the influence of 
the Judiciary in the design and construction process. The 
report made several recommendations regarding the program, 
including limiting funding for construction related finish work 
and detail; reflecting budgeting constraints as urged by 
Congress; and requiring GSA to submit prospectuses with more 
in-depth information.

                              GAO Reviews

    Finally, the Subcommittee has requested the General 
Accounting Office to study two important matters. In November 
1995, the Chairman, Vice-Chair and a senior Member of the 
Subcommittee requested GAO to review the Federal Triangle 
Building, a 3.1 million square foot building currently under 
construction in downtown Washington, D.C. The request asked GAO 
to review the housing plan, financing, construction costs, soft 
costs and other related matters of this project. Secondly, the 
Chairman and Ranking Minority Member asked GAO to review the 
utilization of existing courthouses in cities where GSA 
proposes to construct new courthouses or annexes to existing 
courthouses. There is a growing concern that existing 
facilities are under-utilized at a time when plans call for an 
expansion of court facilities. Both reports are due in 1997.
         SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON RAILROADS

    During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee on Railroads 
chaired by Congresswoman Susan Molinari with Congressman Robert 
E. Wise, Jr. serving as Ranking Democratic Member, developed 
major legislation dealing with the reauthorization of Amtrak, 
the termination of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the 
amendment of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. 
Congressman William O. Lipinski served as the Subcommittee's 
Ranking Democratic Member until the Fall of 1995. Due to 
Committee reorganization, Congressman Wise assumed the position 
of Ranking Member at that time. The Subcommittee also held 
oversight hearings on a wide variety of railroad issues.
                                ------                                


                          Enacted Legislation

    (For a description of the enacted legislation, see section 
on ``Bills Enacted into Law.'')

       THE RAILROAD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1996

    Public Law 104-251 amends the Railroad Unemployment 
Insurance Act to increase the daily unemployment benefits for 
railroad workers from $36 to $42 and reduces the waiting period 
before benefits begin to accrue from 14 days to 7 days. This 
legislation enjoyed bipartisan support in the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee as well as from rail labor and 
rail management.
                                ------                                


                    THE ICC TERMINATION ACT OF 1995

    Public Law 104-88 substantially deregulated the rail and 
motor carrier industries and abolishes the 108-year-old 
Interstate Commerce Commission. The rail portions of the bill 
eliminate obsolete rail provisions and transfer remaining 
functions to a 3-member board (the Surface Transportation 
Board) within the Department of Transportation. Provisions and 
activities that are repealed or eliminated by this law include: 
tariff filing, securities jurisdiction, minimum rate 
regulation, State certification, the commodities clause, 
recyclable commodities rate regime, and valuation jurisdiction. 
Functions that are transferred to the Department of 
Transportation include: maximum rate regulation, rail mergers 
and consolidations, various intercarrier transactions, 
abandonments, and labor protection.
                                ------                                


                           Other Legislation

              AMTRAK REFORM AND PRIVATIZATION ACT OF 1995

    The Committee reported and the House passed H.R. 1788 by a 
vote of 406-4. This legislation would place Amtrak in full 
control of its assets and allow Amtrak to deploy their 
resources where the opportunities are the most promising. The 
restrictive Federal laws that dictate Amtrak's labor benefits 
and practices would be replaced through an accelerated 
collective bargaining process between labor and management. 
Amtrak would be given the benefit of private sector business 
expertise through a reform board of directors and a Temporary 
Rail Advisory Council of business experts who would help Amtrak 
develop its strategy for the future. The Senate failed to take 
any action on this bill.
                                ------                                


                                Hearings

    The Subcommittee held hearings on January 26 and February 
22, 1995, on sunsetting the Interstate Commerce Commission, and 
the subsequent transfer of any retained functions to other 
agencies. The need for legislation came in response to the FY 
1995 DOT Appropriations bill which reduced funding for the ICC 
by 30 percent, and the Clinton Administration's FY 1996 budget 
which proposed complete elimination of the agency. A bill (H.R. 
2539) was introduced on October 26, 1995, by Representatives 
Shuster, Petri, Rahall, and Molinari. An amended bill was 
ordered reported by the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure on November 1, 1995, and was passed by the House 
on November 14, 1995, by a vote of 417-8. This legislation 
became Public Law 104-88.
    On February 7, 10, and 13, 1995, the Subcommittee held 
hearings on the reauthorization of Amtrak. These hearings 
focused on Amtrak's fiscal crisis; Member testimony on Amtrak's 
situation; and an examination of the impediments to greater 
efficiency imposed upon Amtrak by current Federal laws. H.R. 
1788 was introduced on June 8, 1995, and ordered reported, as 
amended, by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
on September 21, 1995. This bill was passed by the House on 
November 30, 1995.
    A hearing was held on September 14, 1995, concerning the 
proposed renewal and expansion of Federal railroad safety user 
fees. The renewal and expansion of fees was assumed in the 
reconciliation assignments of the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee. Testimony was heard from the Federal 
Railroad Administration as well as from freight and commuter 
rail. The fees were not renewed, but the required revenues were 
generated through other legislation.
    In March 1996, oversight hearings were conducted concerning 
railroad safety issues. These hearings came in response to 
numerous railroad accidents which occurred during the month of 
February. The first hearing, on March 5, 1996, dealt with human 
factors and grade-crossing safety issues. The second was 
related to equipment and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) 
regulatory procedures. The final hearing was jointly held with 
the Technology Subcommittee of the Committee on Science 
concerning high technology train control devices. Testimony was 
heard from Federal safety agencies, rail labor, freight and 
commuter railroads, the National Association of Rail 
Passengers, Operation Lifesaver, Rockwell Railroad Electronics, 
and GE-Harris Corporation.
    The Subcommittee held oversight hearings on The Rails to 
Trails Act on July 10 and September 18, 1996. The first hearing 
focused on how the Surface Transportation Board and the Federal 
Highway Administration administer the Federal transportation 
laws and related programs that promote the conversion of 
abandoned railroad lines to recreational trails. The second 
hearing examined the actual conversion of rail rights-of-way to 
recreational trails and their impact on adjacent landowners. 
Testimony was heard from Federal agencies, landowners, and 
trail advocates. There was no legislative action on this issue.
    The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a 
hearing on the proposed acquisition of Conrail by other major 
rail carriers on November 19, 1996. This hearing focused on the 
standards and procedures employed by the Surface Transportation 
Board (STB) in evaluating major rail merger applications, 
including situations where multiple carriers seek approval to 
acquire the same railroad. The hearing also explored the 
various Federal laws still in force which are limited in their 
application solely to Conrail. No further action was taken on 
the issue during the remainder of the 104th Congress.
  SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON SURFACE TRANSPORTATION

    In the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee on Surface 
Transportation was chaired by Thomas Petri of Wisconsin. Nick 
Joe Rahall II of West Virginia was the Subcommittee's Ranking 
Democratic Member. The Subcommittee developed and reported 
significant legislation in all of its areas of jurisdiction, 
including approval of the National Highway System, termination 
of the Interstate Commerce Commission, a 5-year reauthorization 
of the pipeline safety program, amendments to implement the 
Intermodal Safe Container Act of 1992, and an accommodation for 
the District of Columbia. Enacted Legislation
                                ------                                


                          Enacted Legislation

    (For a description of the enacted legislation, see section 
on ``Bills Enacted into Law.'')

            DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HIGHWAY RELIEF ACT OF 1995

    Public Law 104-21, the District of Columbia Highway Relief 
Act permits a Federal share of 100 percent for certain projects 
for the years 1995 and 1996 due to the District's financial 
crisis and its inability to contribute its 20 percent match. 
Without this relief, the District of Columbia would have been 
unable to use its Federal-aid highway funds for 1995 and 1996. 
As a condition of the increased Federal share, the Act directs 
the District to set up a dedicated account for gas tax receipts 
in an amount sufficient to repay the temporarily waived local 
match and to meet future local match requirements. The Act also 
requires that the District's trust fund accounting be analyzed 
by the General Accounting Office.
    H.R. 2017 was ordered reported, as amended, by the Full 
Committee on July 27, 1995 (after the Subcommittee on Surface 
Transportation was discharged). H.R. 2017, as amended, passed 
the House on July 31, 1995, the Senate cleared the measure for 
the President's signature on August 4, 1995.
                                ------                                


            NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT OF 1995

    The Subcommittee's top priority was passage of legislation 
that approved the National Highway System (NHS). In the 
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 
(ISTEA), Congress directed that a network of roads of national 
significance be designated by the States in cooperation with 
DOT and metropolitan areas and submitted to the Congress for 
approval. If Congress did not approve the NHS by September 30, 
1995, then nearly $13 billion in NHS and Interstate Maintenance 
funds would not be apportioned to the States.
    Public Law 104-59, the National Highway System Designation 
Act of 1995, approved the 160,000 mile National Highway System 
and permitted nearly $13 billion in NHS and Interstate 
Maintenance highway funds to be distributed to the States in 
1996 and 1997. While comprising only 4 percent of all highways 
in America, the NHS will carry 40 percent of all traffic, 75 
percent of all freight, and 80 percent of all tourism traffic.
    In addition to approving the NHS, this legislation 
contained several other provisions. First, the legislation 
provides flexibility to States to make up for the one-time 
shortfall in funding in fiscal year 1996 that was caused by 
section 1003 of ISTEA. Section 1003 results in a 13 percent 
reduction in the amount of funds distributed to the States. The 
NHS Designation Act allows States to mitigate these cuts by 
giving them flexibility to utilize categorical funds for 
different types of projects. The Act also rescinds nearly $500 
million in unneeded or unused budget authority and 
redistributes those funds to the States to help make up their 
budget shortfall.
    Second, the legislation eliminates several Federal mandates 
that had been imposed on the States in ISTEA and other 
transportation laws, including the national maximum speed 
limit, motorcycle helmet laws, a requirement for States to use 
crumb rubber in asphalt, a requirement that States adopt 
certain management systems, preemployment alcohol testing for 
transportation employees, and certain transportation conformity 
requirements. The Act also prohibits any requirement that 
highway signs be converted to metric prior to September 30, 
1997.
    Third, the legislation creates a motor carrier safety pilot 
program that will permit carriers that utilize commercial motor 
vehicles between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds flexibility in 
complying with Federal motor carrier safety regulations if they 
devise a program of safety management controls that DOT 
determines will provide an equal or greater level of safety 
than following the motor carrier safety regulations. Fourth, 
the Act creates a pilot program for extended winter deliveries 
of home heating oil. Fifth, the Act amends hours of service 
regulations for certain motor carrier segments whose activities 
are seasonal, including farmers and farm suppliers during 
planting and harvesting seasons, water well drillers, 
construction vehicles and utility service vehicles, and waives 
commercial drivers license requirements for part-time employees 
of small towns and townships during snow emergencies to ensure 
that roads are plowed.
    Finally, the NHS Designation Act contains several 
innovative financing provisions that give States flexibility to 
use scarce resources to leverage Federal-aid highway and 
transit funds, including an infrastructure bank pilot project.
     H.R. 2274 was approved by the Subcommittee on Surface 
Transportation in draft form on September 7, 1995, and 
forwarded to the Full Committee. The Full Committee ordered the 
measure reported, as amended, on September 8, 1995. By a vote 
of 419-7, the House passed H.R. 2274, as amended, on September 
20, 1995. Subsequently, the House passed the Senate bill, S. 
440, and requested a conference with the Senate. The conference 
report was agreed to by the House on November 18, 1995; after 
Senate approval on November 17, 1995. It was signed by the 
President on November 28, 1995.
                                ------                                


         INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION TERMINATION ACT OF 1995

    The motor carrier provisions of Public Law 104-88, the ICC 
Termination Act of 1995, eliminate unnecessary functions of the 
ICC and transferred remaining motor carrier oversight functions 
to the Federal Highway Administration.
    Motor carrier functions transferred to the Department of 
Transportation will be carried out with no increase in 
personnel or funding. The primary Department responsibility 
will be registration of motor carriers and the establishment 
and enforcement of minimum financial responsibility 
requirements. Maintenance of industry commercial rules (such as 
cargo loss and damage and leasing rules) is alao transferred to 
DOT
    H.R. 2539 was approved for Full Committee action by both 
the Surface Transportation and Railroads Subcommittees on 
October 31, 1995. The Full Committee met on November 1, 1995, 
and ordered the bill to be reported, as amended, by a vote of 
36-22. House passage took place on November 14, 1995, by a vote 
of 417-8. The Senate passed the legislation, as amended by the 
text of the Senate companion bill. After a conference, the 
Senate agreed to the conference report on December 21, 1995; 
and the House agreed to the conference report on December 22, 
1995. The President signed the measure on December 29, 1995.
                                ------                                


            DESIGNATION OF THE BILL EMERSON MEMORIAL BRIDGE

    Public Law 104-154 names the bridge crossing the 
Mississippi River between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and East 
Girardeau, Illinois, on Missouri Highway 74 the ``Bill Emerson 
Memorial Bridge.''
    S.1903 would have been refered to the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure, but in response to the 
untimely death of Congressman Emerson, it was taken directly to 
the House and Senate Floors. It passed both Houses on June 25, 
1996, and it was signed into law by the President on July 2, 
1996.
                                ------                                


    INTERMODAL SAFE CONTAINER TRANSPORTATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1996

    The Intermodal Safe Container Transportation Act Amendments 
of 1996 became title II of Public Law 104-291. It made several 
changes to the Intermodal Safe Container Act of 1992, to permit 
that statute to be implemented. Industry and DOT agreed that 
the 1992 Act would impede the transfer of intermodal containers 
between ocean carriers, railroads and trucking companies, and 
that modifications were necessary. DOT regulations making the 
1992 Act effective were to go into effect on January 1, 1997.
    H.R. 4040, the original bill, was ordered reported by the 
Full Committee on September 12, 1996, and it was pased by the 
House under suspension of the rules on September 18, 1996. The 
Senate incorporated its provisions into an amendment to H.R. 
3159, the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments of 
1996, on September 18, 1996. The President signed H.R. 3159 
into law on October 11, 1996.

        ACCOUNTABLE PIPELINE SAFETY AND PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1996

    Public Law 104-304 reauthorizes the pipeline safety program 
for fiscal years 1996 through 2000. Pipelines remain our safest 
form of transportation. Fatalities from pipeline accidents 
represent less than .003 percent of the total number of 
fatalities of all modes of transportation on an annual basis. 
Over the past 3 decades, the safety record of pipelines has 
continued to improve while the total number of miles of 
pipelines has steadily increased.
    The Act moves the program to a new risk-based approach by 
incorporating risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis in the 
establishment of new pipeline safety standards, based on 
current Office of Pipeline Safety practices in accordance with 
Executive Order 12866, regarding cost-benefit analysis. The Act 
establishes a risk management demonstration program, whereby 
pipeline operators may be exempted from any or all safety 
requirements if the operator submits, and DOT approves, a 
safety plan that will achieve a level of safety equal to or 
greater than that which would be achieved through following the 
regulations. The Secretary may revoke any exemption for 
substantial noncompliance or in emergencies.
    The bill authorizes a total of $103.841 million for 
hazardous liquid and gas pipeline programs, and $71 million for 
the State grant program. The primary source of funding is 
provided through industry user fees. The bill also expands 
criminal penalties to persons who damage pipelines and do not 
report the damage, removes the 2-year pipeline inspection 
requirement (leaving it to the discretion of the Secretary), 
and makes other minor and technical changes.
    H.R. 1323, the Pipeline Safety Act of 1995 (the original 
House bill) was reported by both the Committees on 
Transportation and Infrastructure (on May 1, 1995), and 
Commerce (on June 1, 1995). The Senate bill, S. 1505, was 
passed by the Senate, as amended, on September 26, 1996, and 
the House also passed S. 1505 on September 27, 1996. The 
President signed S. 1505 into law on October 12, 1996.
                                ------                                


                           Other Legislation

          SMALL BUSINESS TRANSPORT CORRECTION ADVANCEMENT ACT

    The Subcommittee reported H.R. 3153, a bill to direct the 
Secretary of Transportation to complete by December 31, 1996, a 
pending rulemaking concerning ``materials of trade'' exceptions 
to hazardous materials regulation. The bill was amended during 
consideration by the House to provide that if a final rule 
extending Federal hazardous materials regulation to intrastate 
transportation does not allow States to grant exceptions for 
not-for-hire intrastate transportation by farmers and farm-
related service industries, then the portion of the rule 
affecting farm vehicles cannot take effect before the earlier 
of the date of the enactment of the reauthorization of the 
hazardous materials program or the 180th day following the 
effective date of the final rule. The bill passed the House on 
the Corrections Calendar by voice vote on September 24, 1996, 
but was not acted on by the Senate.
                                ------                                


               DESIGNATION OF THE WILLIAM NATCHER BRIDGE

    H.R. 3572 named the bridge currently under construction on 
U.S. 231 that would link U.S. 60 near Maceo, Kentucky, with 
Rockport, Indiana, in honor of the late William Natcher. 
William Natcher, a Congressman for over 40 years and former 
Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, was well known for 
casting over 18,000 consecutive votes. He died in 1994.
                                ------                                


                                Hearings

    During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee held an 
extensive series of hearings on programs under its jurisdiction

transportation trust funds off budget. The largest of the four 
trust funds is the Highway Trust Fund, which contains the 
Highway and Mass Transit Accounts. The Subcommittee heard 
testimony on how the Congressional budget process has resulted 
in the use of the trust funds to offset the overall size of the 
Federal deficit, and has prevented the use of over $6 billion 
of ISTEA-authorized funds.
    In connection with the decision by Congress in the Budget 
Resolution and the Administration budget to eliminate the 
Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the Subcommittee held a 
hearing on March 3, 1995, on the disposition of the motor 
carrier functions of the ICC. The Subcommittee heard testimony 
from DOT, the ICC, the General Accounting Office, the trucking 
industry, shippers and labor. Both DOT and the ICC submitted 
reports to Congress recommending which functions should be 
retained and transferred to DOT or an independent entity, which 
functions should be eliminated, and which should be 
streamlined.
    On March 14, 1995, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the 
reauthorization of the Natural Gas and Hazardous Liquid 
Pipeline Safety Acts. The statutory authorization for these 
programs expired at the end of fiscal year 1995. The

aid highway and transit projects. On July 25, 1996, the 
Subcommittee held a hearing on the surface transportation 
program established in ISTEA. On July 30, 1996, the 
Subcommittee held a hearing to examine the metropolitan and 
Statewide planning processes established in ISTEA and the role 
of metropolitan planning organizations. On September 19, 1996, 
the Subcommittee held a hearing to examine the Federal highway 
safety programs, including the section 402, 403 and 410 grant 
programs, and other highway traffic safety issues. On September 
26, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing examining ways to 
improve the delivery of Federal highway and transit grant 
programs and on the congestion mitigation and air quality 
program (CMAQ) established in ISTEA.
    The Subcommittee held a hearing on April 25, 1996, on 
unauthorized highway and transit statutory changes requested by 
the Administration in its fiscal year 1997 budget. In addition, 
the Subcommittee heard testimony from transit agencies 
requesting funding in fiscal year 1997 for transit projects not 
authorized in ISTEA or that would exceed their ISTEA 
authorizations.
    The Subcommittee also held three field hearings. On August 
8, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing in Laredo, Texas, on 
the infrastructure and motor carrier safety and regulatory 
issues related to the implementation of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The Subcommittee heard testimony from

   SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER RESOURCES AND 
                              ENVIRONMENT

    During the 104th Congress, the Subcommittee on Water 
Resources and Environment, chaired by Congressman Sherwood L. 
Boehlert with Congressman Robert A. Borski serving as Ranking 
Minority Member, had referred to it or took action on 7 bills 
which became public laws and 4 bills which were approved by the 
House but not acted on by the Senate. In addition, 4 bills were 
enacted which contained subject matter within the jurisdiction 
of the Subcommittee but were not referred to the Committee. The 
Committee also approved 56 Committee Resolutions authorizing 
studies by the Corps of Engineers of potential water resources 
projects. The Subcommittee held 24 hearings during the 104th 
Congress.
                                ------                                


                          Enacted Legislation

    (For a description of the enacted legislation, see section 
on ``Bills Enacted into Law.'')

                WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1996

    Public Law 104-303, the Water Resources Development Act of 
1996 (WRDA), authorizes water resources development and 
conservation projects of the Army Corps of Engineers. It also 
modifies Corps water policies and modifies the agency's water 
resources programs. The WRDA reflects a continued Federal 
commitment to water infrastructure, responds to initiatives to 
update water polices, and takes advantage of opportunities to 
strengthen the Corps' role in protecting and restoring the 
aquatic environment.
    The WRDA resumes the biennial authorization of Corps water 
resources programs. It authorizes approximately $3.8 billion in 
Federal appropriations for water projects and programs. The 
total estimated cost (Federal and non-Federal) is $5.4 billion. 
Highlights include: authorization of 44 projects with final or 
pending reports of the Chief of Engineers; modification of 
cost-sharing requirements for flood control projects, 
navigation projects involving dredged material disposal 
facilities, and feasibility studies; creation of a new 
authority for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems; expansion 
of authorities for modifications to existing projects for 
environmental restoration and for environmental dredging; 
authorization of construction of flood control projects by non-
Federal interests; modifications to the national dam safety 
program; affirmation of the Federal role in shoreline 
protection projects; modification of the Federal hopper dredge 
fleet; modifications to projects to reflect changed conditions 
and cost increases; and authorization of various water 
resources studies.
    Subcommittee hearings on water resources issues and 
projects were held on February 7, 1995, February 27 and 28, 
1996, and March 21, 1996. On June 6, 1996, Representatives 
Shuster, Oberstar, Boehlert and Borski introduced H.R. 3592, 
the House version of WRDA. The bill was referred to the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. On June 27, 1996, 
the amended bill was ordered reported by the committee. The 
Senate version of the bill, S. 640, passed the Senate on July 
11, 1996, and was referred in the House to the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee. On July 30, 1996, H.R. 3592, as 
amended, was passed by the House under suspension of the Rules. 
The text of H.R. 3592 was then passed as an amendment to S. 640 
in the form of a substitute. The conference report accompanying 
S. 640 was approved by the House and Senate by voice vote. The 
bill became Public Law 104-303.

                     WATER DESALINATION ACT OF 1996

    S. 811, the Water Desalination Research and Development Act 
of 1995, passed the Senate on May 3, 1996, and was referred to 
the Resources Committee and, in addition, the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee and the Science Committee. The 
legislation authorized desalination research and demonstration 
programs for the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of 
the Army. On September 16, 1996, the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee agreed to be discharged from further 
consideration of the bill. The House passed S. 811, as 
modified, on September 24, 1996, and the Senate passed S. 811, 
as modified by the House, on September 27, 1996. The final 
version of the Water Desalination Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-
298) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation 
with the Secretary of the Army and other Federal agencies, to 
conduct various projects, programs, and activities for 
desalination research, development and demonstration.

           WATER SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1995

    Included as title V of the Safe Drinking Water Act 
Amendments of 1996 (Public Law 104-182), this legislation 
authorizes $350 million over 7 years for EPA grants to States 
for drinking water infrastructure and watershed protection. Up 
to 70 percent of the grants may be used for the construction, 
rehabilitation, or improvement of water supply, treatment and 
distribution facilities; up to 30 percent may be used for 
certain watershed protection activities consistent with 
nonpoint source pollution management programs under the Clean 
Water Act.
    Representatives Shuster, Oberstar, Boehlert and Borski 
introduced the legislation, H.R. 2747, on December 7, 1995. The 
Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee held a hearing on 
the bill on January 29, 1996. The bill passed the House on June 
25, 1996, as title V of H.R. 3604, the Safe Drinking Water Act 
Amendments of 1996. House and Senate conferees on the Safe 
Drinking Water legislation included the water infrastructure 
and watershed protection grants program in title V of the Safe 
Drinking Water Act Amendments; other provisions in H.R. 2747, 
relating to a drinking water SRF and grants for Alaska and the 
New York City watershed, were included in other titles of the 
drinking water law.
    In addition, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee 
conferees agreed with other House and Senate conferees to 
include provisions in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 
1996 regarding, among other things: modernization of the 
Washington Aqueduct facilities, source water and groundwater 
protection programs, authority to transfer a percentage of 
funds between the drinking water SRF and the Clean Water Act 
SRF, and grants for wastewater assistance in ``colonias'' in 
the U.S. along the Mexican border.

                    EDIBLE OIL REGULATORY REFORM ACT

    Over the last several years, the Committee has received 
testimony and other information regarding the regulation of 
animal fats and vegetable oils, particularly regarding spill 
prevention, response and cleanup requirements under the Oil 
Pollution Act, Clean Water Act, and Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Act. The concern was that regulatory agencies 
were not adequately taking into account the differences between 
toxic, petroleum-based oils and edible oils. In response, 
Representatives Tom Ewing, Pat Danner and others introduced 
H.R. 436 to require that agencies make such distinctions under 
various laws.
    H.R. 436 passed the House of Representatives on October 10, 
1995, as part of the Corrections Day Calendar. The Committee 
worked with the Commerce Committee and the Agriculture 
Committee to develop an acceptable substitute to the bill 
reported by the Commerce Committee. On November 7, 1995, the 
House agreed by voice vote to accept minor revisions to H.R. 
436 made by the Senate. The bill became Public Law 104-55.

                    DEEPWATER PORT MODERNIZATION ACT

    Title V of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 
(Public Law 104-324) includes the Deepwater Port Modernization 
Act, which updates and improves the Deepwater Port Act of 1974 
to increase flexibility in the use of deepwater ports and to 
coordinate various regulatory and licensing authorities under 
the Act.
    Title V of Public Law 104-324 is identical to H.R. 2940, 
the Deepwater Port Modernization Act, as reported by the 
Committee on July 18, 1996, and as passed by the House on 
September 18, 1996. The bill was introduced on February 1, 
1996, and referred to the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee and in addition the Judiciary Committee. The Water 
Resources and Environment Subcommittee and the Coast Guard and 
Maritime Transportation Subcommittee held a joint hearing on 
the bill on March 28, 1996. On June 27, 1996, the Subcommittees 
were discharged from further consideration and the full 
Committee ordered the bill reported, as amended. On July 18, 
1996, the Judiciary Committee agreed to be discharged from 
further consideration of the bill. On September 18, 1996, the 
House passed H.R. 2940 by voice vote under suspension of the 
rules. House and Senate conferees on the Coast Guard 
Authorization bill then included the House-passed bill as Title 
V of Public Law 104-324.

                     NATIONAL INVASIVE SPECIES ACT

    H.R. 4283, the National Invasive Species Act of 1996 
(NISA), reauthorizes and amends the Nonindigenous Aquatic 
Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 to strengthen and 
improve the Nation's response to threats posed by aquatic 
nuisance plants and animals. The legislation provides for, 
among other things, a Nationwide voluntary ballast water 
management program and other measures to prevent the 
introduction and spread of invasive species into waters of the 
United States.
    NISA originally was introduced, reported favorably by the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and passed the 
House by voice vote on September 24, 1996, as H.R. 3217. The 
Senate did not act on H.R. 3217 so in the last days of the 
104th Congress, Congressman LaTourette reintroduced NISA, with 
a few amendments to address concerns raised after passage of 
H.R. 3217, as H.R. 4283. The House passed H.R. 4283 by voice 
vote on September 28, 1996. The Senate cleared the measure for 
Presidential signature on October 3, 1996. The bill was signed 
into law on October 26, 1996, as Public Law 104-332.

        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996

    Public Law 104-106 includes several provisions within the 
jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and 
Environment.
    Section 325 amends section 312 of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act to add a subsection to address certain 
discharges from vessels of the Armed Forces. New section 312(n) 
requires the Administrator of EPA and the Secretary of Defense 
to identify those Armed Forces vessels for which it is 
reasonable and practicable to require use of a marine pollution 
control device. The Secretary of the Defense must then require 
the use of these devices on such vessels. EPA and the Secretary 
of Defense are required to jointly promulgate performance 
standards for marine pollution control devices, taking into 
consideration vessel class, types, and sizes. This subsection 
also prohibits individual States from regulating such marine 
pollution control devices, except that individual States may 
prohibit discharges from vessels in waters identified by the 
State if EPA agrees that such a prohibition is necessary to 
protect and enhance water quality in those waters.
    Section 2834 amends section 120(h) of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 
to allow the Federal government to lease Federal property prior 
to completion of any necessary cleanup of that property.
    This bill was not referred to the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. However, the Committee 
participated in the conference on this bill.

                     ILLINOIS LAND CONSERVATION ACT

    As part of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106), this legislation 
provides for the conversion of the Joliet Army Ammunition Plant 
to the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie (MNP) and other uses, 
and provides for the disposal of real property at the Arsenal. 
The provision is based on a land use plan developed by the 
Joilet Arsenal Planning Commission. The total acreage involved 
is approximately 23,500 acres. Of this amount 3,000 acres will 
be turned over to the State of Illinois for use in economic 
redevelopment as an industrial park; 982 acres will be turned 
over to the Department of Veterans Affairs for use as a 
National Veterans Cemetery; 455 acres will be turned over to 
Will County for use as a nonhazardous landfill; and the 
remaining acreage will be turned over to the Department of 
Agriculture for management as the MNP. The Secretary of the 
Army retains the responsibility for cleaning up Superfund sites 
and for compliance with environmental laws. Transfers are to be 
made without consideration, except that the State is to pay 
fair market value for lands transferred to it 20 years after 
conveyance or upon subsequent conveyance of the property, 
whichever occurs first. The Secretary of Agriculture is to 
manage the MNP as part of the National Forest System and shall 
manage its land and water resources to conserve and enhance the 
native populations and habitats of fish, wildlife and plants. 
Additional purposes of the MNP are to provide opportunities for 
scientific, environmental, educational, recreational and 
research uses.

        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997

    Public Law 104-201 includes several provisions within the 
jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and 
Environment.
    Section 324 amends section 3(c) of the Act to Prevent 
Pollution from Ships to allow Navy vessels to discharge certain 
nonfloatable non-plastic solid wastes, notwithstanding the 
requirements of Annex V to the International Convention for the 
Prevention of Pollution from Ships, where the Secretary of the 
Navy determines that the vessel has a unique military design 
and full compliance with Annex V is not technologically 
feasible or would impair the operation or operational 
capability of the ship.
    Section 330 amends section 120(d) of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
(CERCLA) to provide the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency with the authority under section 105 of 
CERCLA to withhold listing a Federal facility on the National 
Priorities List. The section specifically States that the 
Administrator may take into account the fact that a facility is 
being cleaned up under another authority when deciding whether 
or not to place a Federal facility on the National Priorities 
List.
    Section 331 amends section 120(h)(4)(A) of CERCLA to 
clarify that Federal property is not considered contaminated if 
hazardous substances were merely stored on the property, 
without any release to the environment.
    Section 333 requires the Navy to develop and implement a 
program to monitor the concentrations of organotin in coastal 
waters. Under the Organotin Anitfouling Paint Control Act of 
1988, this monitoring program was originally to be developed 
and implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
Under this section, the Navy must consult with EPA and EPA must 
pay the costs of the program.
    Section 334 amends section 120(h)(3) of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 
to allow the Federal government to transfer Federal property 
prior to completion of a required response action necessary to 
protect human health and the environment, if the property is 
suitable for the use intended by the transferee, the use is 
consistent with the protection of human health and the 
environment, the deed or other agreement governing the transfer 
contains the response action assurances specified in this 
section, public notice is provided, and the deferral and 
transfer will not substantially delay cleanup.
    This bill was not referred to the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. However, the Committee 
participated in the conference on this bill.

        OMNIBUS CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997

    This law contains several provisions within the 
jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and 
Environment.
    Title II of Division A of the Omnibus Consolidated 
Appropriations Bill includes the ``Economic Growth and 
Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996,'' a banking 
regulatory reform bill. Subtitle E of the banking bill consists 
of the ``Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit 
Insurance Protection Act of 1996.'' This Act amends the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and 
Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to clarify when lenders and 
fiduciaries may be held liable under section 107 of CERCLA for 
the cleanup of contaminated property.
    In 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a 
rule specifying when lenders could be held liable under CERCLA. 
In 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated 
this rule on the grounds that EPA has no statutory authority to 
establish rules of liability. In the 104th Congress, several 
bills were introduced and referred to the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee to address this issue by substantively 
amending the statute to clarify when lenders and fiduciaries 
can be held liable under CERCLA. Similar language also was 
included in H.R. 1858, the banking regulatory reform bill that 
was reported by the Banking Committee. However, at the request 
of the Commerce Committee and the Transportation Committee, the 
Banking Committee agreed to address lender liability through 
``Sense of Congress'' language. This ``Sense of Congress'' 
language was included in Banking Committee regulatory reform 
bills, H.R. 2520 and H.R. 4079, subsequently introduced by 
Congressman Leach. The Senate banking regulatory reform bill, 
S. 650, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee, included 
substantive environmental liability provisions for lenders and 
fiduciaries, including amendments to CERCLA.
    Neither the House nor the Senate banking regulatory reform 
bills, nor any other bills addressing lender liability, were 
acted upon as stand-alone legislation by the full House or 
Senate. Instead, a revised version of the Senate banking 
legislation was incorporated into the Omnibus Consolidated 
Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1997, H.R. 4278. Ultimately, the 
Conference Report for H.R. 3610, the Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act for FY 1997, was used as the legislative 
vehicle for the omnibus appropriations bill, including the 
lender and fiduciary liability provisions. In general, the 
enacted legislation takes the approach of substantively 
amending CERCLA to clarify the potential liability of lenders 
and fiduciaries under CERCLA.
    Title I of Division E of the Omnibus Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 1997 included the ``California Bay-Delta 
Environmental Enhancement and Water Security Act.'' This Act 
authorizes $429,900,000 for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 to 
support the California-Federal Bay-Delta Program for 
developing, funding, and implementing solutions to problems 
regarding ecosystem quality, water quality, water supply and 
reliability, and system vulnerability affecting the San 
Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Watershed. This Act 
was introduced on September 19, 1996, by Congressman Bill Baker 
and others, and was referred to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure and, in addition, the Committee on 
Resources. It was also enacted into law as Title XI of the 
Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, Public 
Law 104-333.
    The bill making Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations for 
Fiscal Year 1997 was not referred to the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. However, the Committee 
participated in the negotiations over the language of the 
lender liability provisions of this bill and the California 
Bay-Delta Environmental Enhancement and Water Security Act.
                                ------                                


                           Other Legislation

                     CLEAN WATER AMENDMENTS OF 1995

    H.R. 961, the Clean Water Amendments of 1995, was developed 
and introduced by a bipartisan coalition of certain Members 
from the Committee. The legislation would have reauthorized and 
amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 
(commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act(CWA)). The Act was 
last amended comprehensively in 1987 and most of its 
authorizations of appropriations expired in 1991.
    During 7 days of hearings in February and March 1995, and 
at hearings held in the 103rd Congress, the Committee heard 
extensive testimony about specific areas to be addressed 
through comprehensive Clean Water Act reauthorization 
legislation, including the need to (1) respond to concerns 
about unfunded mandates, (2) develop effective approaches to 
reduce pollution from nonpoint and stormwater runoff and other 
wet weather flows, (3) provide additional flexibility--with 
accountability--and increased State and local roles in 
implementation of the Act, (4) modify certain aspects of the 
financing and regulatory authorities of the Act to address the 
particular needs of smaller communities, (5) modify the way EPA 
incorporates risk assessment, cost-benefit analysis, and 
performance-based measures into the standard setting process, 
and (6) comprehensively reform the regulatory process for 
permitting activities that take place in wetlands.
    Title I, Research and Related Programs, concerned various 
research and related programs and authorizations for some core 
programs in the Act. $150 million per year were authorized for 
State program grants. In addition, title I authorized new grant 
assistance for sanitation facilities in rural and Native Alaska 
villages ($25 million per year), reauthorized Chesapeake Bay 
programs ($18 million per year), and reauthorized Great Lakes 
programs ($17.5 million per year). Additional provisions 
addressed Great Lakes research and implementation of the Great 
Lakes Water Quality Initiative.
    Title II, Construction Grants, provided certain technical 
amendments to the construction grants title of the Act 
concerning assistance for construction of municipal wastewater 
treatment plants. The bill also authorized title II grant funds 
($300 million in FY 1996) to assist small communities with 
construction of wastewater treatment works and to assist 
economically disadvantaged or hardship coastal localities.
    Title III, Standards and Enforcement, amended CWA title 
III, concerning standards, regulation, and enforcement. Several 
sections in this title allowed for some modification of point 
source discharge requirements or permit limitations. The bill 
also allowed for modifying CWA requirements imposed on 
industrial facilities whose wastes are treated by municipal 
wastewater treatment plants. Title III also reauthorized the 
National Estuary Program.
    Title III contained a number of amendments to section 319 
of the Act, concerning management of nonpoint sources of 
pollution. Section 319 grant funds would have been reauthorized 
and increased from $100 million in FY 1996 to $300 million in 
FY 2000 (a total of $1 billion). Title III also established a 
new watershed management program in the Clean Water Act. The 
bill would have allowed, among other things, pollutant trading 
or transfer between sources or dischargers in a watershed. H.R. 
961 added new section 322 to the Act which would significantly 
modify the current stormwater permit program (section 402(p)) 
into a nonpoint source management-type program. In addition, 
title III would have added new provisions to the CWA concerning 
risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis.
    Title IV, Permits and Licenses, contained amendments to 
permit provisions of CWA title IV. Several of the proposed 
amendments would have modified section 402 of the Act, the 
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, the principal 
permit section of the law. Title IV also added provisions 
concerning overflows from combined stormwater and sanitary 
sewers (CSOs) and sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs).
    Title V, General Provisions, provided miscellaneous 
amendments to definitions and general provisions of the Act. It 
also provided language clarifying that the Federal Government 
may not use the CWA to supersede or otherwise impair the 
allocation of water quantity rights by States. Another section 
established a dispute resolution process involving section 401 
water quality certifications by States and FERC licenses for 
hydropower facilities.
    Title VI, State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds, 
extended authorization for the SRF grants, at approximately 
$2.3 billion per year level and provided a new State-by-State 
allotment formula for SRF grant distribution. Title VI also 
contained several provisions to assist small and disadvantaged 
communities. H.R. 961 encouraged privatization of wastewater 
treatment works owned by a municipality or other local 
government entity.
    Title VII, Miscellaneous Provisions, provided technical 
amendments to the text of the CWA, as well as authorizing $50 
million for grants to assist States along the U.S.-Mexico 
border.
    Title VIII, Wetlands Conservation and Management, concerned 
wetlands regulatory programs, conservation, and management. It 
incorporated language based on a wetlands proposal that Rep. 
Jimmy Hayes and others introduced as H.R. 1330 in several 
recent Congresses. H.R. 961 included provisions of legislation 
passed by the House concerning private property owner 
compensation. The revised section 404 would separate wetlands 
into three categories according to ecological significance, 
ranging from Type A (the most ecologically valuable) to Type C 
(the least valuable).
    Title IX, Navigational Dredging, amended portions of title 
I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (the 
Ocean Dumping Act) to streamline regulatory requirements 
applicable to navigational dredging.
    Title X, Additional Provisions, reauthorized and amended 
the coastal nonpoint pollution control program established in 
the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990.
    The Subcommittee considered and approved H.R. 961, as 
amended, on March 29, 1995, by a vote of 19 to 5. The Full 
Committee considered H.R. 961 on April 4, 5, and 6; the bill 
was ordered reported, as amended, on April 6 by a vote of 42-
16. The House considered H.R. 961 on May 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, and 
16, 1995, passing the measure by a final vote of 240 to 185. No 
action was taken in the Senate.

                Constructed Water Conveyances Reform Act

    H.R. 2567, the Constructed Water Conveyances Reform Act, 
was introduced on November 1, 1995, and referred to the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The introduced 
bill was virtually identical to provisions in section 305 of 
H.R. 961, the Clean Water Amendments of 1995. The Water 
Resources and Environment Subcommittee did not hold a separate 
hearing on H.R. 2567, but did receive testimony on constructed 
water conveyances and other issues of particular importance to 
western, arid areas in its series of hearings on the Clean 
Water Act and H.R. 961. The Committee ordered the bill 
reported, as amended, on December 14, 1995, and filed its 
report on December 21, 1995. The House passed H.R. 2567, as 
amended, by voice vote on the Corrections Calendar on January 
23, 1996. No further action was taken by the Senate.
    As passed by the House, H.R. 2567 would have amended the 
Clean Water Act to provide States greater flexibility in 
setting water quality standards for constructed water 
conveyances. The legislation also described various relevant 
factors and uses for the States to take into account and 
specified that constructed water conveyances were man-made 
systems for transporting agricultural and municipal and 
industrial water supplies in waterways that were not currently 
or at any time in the past natural waterways.

               San Diego Coastal Corrections Act of 1995

    H.R. 1943, the San Diego Coastal Corrections Act of 1995, 
was introduced on June 28, 1995, and referred to the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The bill was 
identical to section 309 (a) of H.R. 961, the Clean Water 
Amendments of 1995. The Water Resources and Environment 
Subcommittee did not hold a separate hearing on H.R. 1943 but 
did receive testimony and other information on the legislative 
proposal in its series of hearings on the Clean Water Act and 
H.R. 961. On July 12, 1995, the Subcommittee was discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 1943 and the Committee 
ordered the bill reported. On July 25, 1995, the House passed 
H.R. 1943 on the Corrections Calendar by a vote of 269 to 156. 
No further action was taken by the Senate.
    As passed by the House, H.R. 1943 would have amended the 
Clean Water Act to treat certain municipal wastewater treatment 
facilities discharging into ocean waters as the equivalent of 
secondary treatment if certain conditions and requirements were 
met. These included requirements to employ chemically enhanced 
primary treatment, comply with local and State water quality 
standards, and subject the discharge to an acceptable ocean 
monitoring program.

                        Snow Removal Policy Act

    In response to concerns about the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's (FEMA's) policies regarding disaster 
declarations and eligible assistance for snow-related events, 
Representative Jack Quinn and others introduced H.R. 3348, the 
Snow Removal Policy Act. The legislation requires FEMA to 
issue, not later than 9 months after enactment, a final rule 
establishing criteria and standards for major disasters and 
emergency declarations and eligibilities for assistance 
regarding snow-related events.
    The Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee held a 
hearing on the bill on September 11, 1996. On September 12, the 
Subcommittee was discharged from further consideration of the 
bill and the Committee ordered the bill reported with minor 
amendments. The House of Representatives passed the bill by 
voice vote on September 18, 1996.

                    Reform of Superfund Act of 1995

    H.R. 2500, the Reform of Superfund Act of 1995, was 
developed by the Republican leadership of the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee and of the Commerce Committee. The 
bill was reported by the Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, 
Trade and Hazardous Materials, but was not marked up by either 
the full Commerce Committee or by the Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee or the Water Resources and Environment 
Subcommittee.
    H.R. 2500 would have reauthorized the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 
1980, commonly known as ``Superfund,'' for a period of 5 years. 
The bill also would have extended the corporate taxes which 
fund the Superfund Trust Fund for 5 years. In addition to 
reauthorizing the core Superfund program, the bill would have 
made significant changes to the program.
    Title I would have changed the remedy selection process by 
providing that Superfund remedy decisions are not based on 
compound conservative estimates that do not adequately take 
risk into account; ensuring that risk assessments are based on 
reasonably foreseeable future uses of land, water and other 
resources, as recommended by a Community Assistance Group; 
ensuring that the costs and benefits of cleanup options are 
fully considered when selecting Superfund remedies to ensure 
that remedies are not selected where the costs exceed the 
benefits; eliminating a preference for treatment when selecting 
among protective remedies; and eliminating a reliance on 
generic cleanup standards from other Federal and State 
statutes, regulations, and guidance, in favor of reliance upon 
site-specific risk assessments.
    Title II proposed changes to liability for response costs 
including eliminating pre-1987 liability at all municipal and 
co-disposal (mixed industrial and municipal) landfills to allow 
these sites to proceed to cleanup through use of the Federal 
fund, without engaging in lengthy debates over degrees of 
liability among all the persons who sent waste materials to 
such landfills. Title II also proposed eliminating liability 
for parties that sent only a de minimis amount of waste to a 
site (less than 1 percent). For all other sites, the bill would 
have provided a fast-track allocation process, and, to 
ameliorate the impacts of retroactive liability and to reduce 
contention over allocation of liability, the Federal fund would 
reimburse parties for 50 percent of response costs associated 
with wastes disposed prior to January 1, 1987. In the Commerce 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Hazardous Materials, the 
liability provisions were amended to eliminate pre-1987 
liability at oil and battery recycling sites to help allow 
those complex multi-party sites to proceed to cleanup through 
use of the Federal fund.
    Title III sought to encourage the return of abandoned 
industrial sites to productive use by supporting State 
brownfields and voluntary cleanup programs. The bill would have 
barred EPA from subsequently reviewing State cleanup decisions, 
clarified when lenders and fiduciaries could be held liable, 
and eliminated liability for new property purchasers who did 
not cause or contribute to any existing environmental problem 
at a facility.
    Title IV would have amended the statute's provisions 
governing the recovery of natural resource damages to enhance 
the role of cost-effectiveness in selecting restoration 
measures; eliminate so-called ``non-use'' damages and thus the 
need for or use of contingent valuation methodology; codified 
the baseline for lost use damages as the date of enactment of 
CERCLA; clarify the relationship between lost use damages and 
restoration damages; cap liability for damages at $50 million 
per facility; and eliminate the statutory rebuttable 
presumption that the government's estimate of damages is 
correct in instances where the natural resource trustee 
conducts the damage assessment in accordance with applicable 
regulations. The bill also would have required better 
coordination among multiple natural resource trustees.
    To encourage States to build up their own cleanup programs 
to ultimately replace the Federal Superfund program, title V 
would have allowed States to accept delegation of all or part 
of the Superfund program, on a State-wide or site-by-site 
basis; required State and local government concurrence to list 
a site on the National Priorities List (NPL); reduced the State 
cost share to 10 percent for all costs; and capped the NPL of 
the Nation's worst toxic waste sites at 125 additional sites 
over the next 7 years.
    Title VI would have allowed qualified States to select 
remedies at Federal facilities; expressly made interagency 
agreements for the cleanup of Federal facilities enforceable in 
court; encouraged use of Federal facilities to test innovative 
remedies; and clarified that uncontaminated property at a 
Federal facility is not part of an NPL listing.
    Title VII of the bill would have made miscellaneous 
amendments, including amendments to definitions.
    Title VIII would have amended the Oil Pollution Act to 
eliminate non-use natural resource damages and the need for 
contingent valuation methodology, and made other changes 
similar to the amendments to the CERCLA natural resource 
damages provisions proposed in Title IV.
    Title IX would have amended the Resource Conservation and 
Recovery Act to allow State cleanup agencies to select cleanup 
criteria for remediation waste, in lieu of the federally 
promulgated land disposal restrictions.
    Finally, Title X would have reauthorized the Superfund 
business taxes and required that new revenue collected from the 
Superfund taxes be spent on cleanup activities.
    Although H.R. 2500 was not marked up by the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee, various proposals to amend the 
bill were made during negotiations over the bill with the 
Ranking Members of the Transportation and Infrastructure and 
Commerce Committees and the Clinton Administration.
    A similar bill, S. 1285, was introduced in the Senate. That 
bill was never acted upon by the Senate Environment and Public 
Works Committee.

          Natural Disaster Protection Partnership Act of 1995

    H.R. 1856, the Natural Disaster Protection Partnership Act, 
was introduced by Representative Bill Emerson and others on 
June 15, 1995. The legislation was similar to H.R. 2873, the 
Natural Disaster Protection Partnership Act of 1994, which the 
Committee reported in the 103rd Congress. The Subcommittee held 
hearings on H.R. 1856 on October 18, 1995, and December 5, 
1995. A comprehensive substitute bill was circulated for 
comment in July 1996. No further action was taken in Committee. 
Comparable legislation in the Senate was also the subject of 
hearings but no further Committee action.
    H.R. 1856 amended the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief 
and Emergency Assistance Act and contained three basic 
elements: (1) States must adopt hazard mitigation plans and 
measures (such as building codes) that meet certain minimum 
requirements, or lose some Federal disaster assistance; (2) 
households earning in excess of $60,000 a year and all 
businesses in disaster-prone States must purchase disaster 
insurance or they will not be eligible for certain Federal 
disaster assistance; and (3) creation of a federally-backed 
private corporation that must offer seismic and volcano 
insurance to homeowners and businesses, and seismic, volcano, 
and hurricane reinsurance to insurers and State insurance 
pools.
    The intent of the bill was, among other things, to: (1) 
place more emphasis on prevention, rather than response, which 
will save lives and reduce losses in the long-term; (2) shift 
the risk of natural disasters away from the Federal government 
and overexposed insurers to those who benefit most from the 
Federal government's involvement (property owners); and (3) 
assure that disaster insurance would be more readily available.
                                ------                                


                                Hearings

    The Subcommittee held hearings on February 7, 1995, 
February 27 and 28, 1996, and March 21, 1996, on proposals for 
the Water Resources Development Act to provide for conservation 
and development of water and related resources, to authorize 
the Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for 
improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States and for 
other purposes. These hearings were conducted to receive 
testimony on the water resources programs of the Army Corps of 
Engineers and on proposals for the upcoming Water Resources 
Development Act. A bill (H.R. 3592) was introduced on June 6, 
1996, by Congressmen Shuster, Oberstar, Boehlert and Borski. An 
amended bill was ordered reported by the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure on June 27, 1996, and passed 
by the House on July 30, 1996. The bill became Public Law 104-
303.
    On February 9, 16, 21, 24, 1995, and March 7 and 9, 1995, 
the Subcommittee held hearings on the reauthorization of the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act, focusing on State and 
local perspectives; on business and economic development 
perspectives; on the Administration's perspectives; on 
agricultural, energy and environmental perspectives; on 
wetlands and property rights; and on local and regional issues. 
On March 11, 1995, the Subcommittee also held a field hearing 
in Utica, New York on nonpoint source pollution. The hearing 
was conducted to examine issues surrounding proposed changes to 
the Nation's nonpoint source water policies, the importance of 
using watershed planning to control nonpoint source pollution 
and to address the scope of nonpoint source pollution and its 
impact on recreation and the environment. H.R. 961, the Clean 
Water Amendments of 1995, was introduced on February 15, 1995, 
and ordered reported, as amended, by the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure on April 6, 1995, and passed 
by the House on May 16, 1995.
    On June 13, 20, 21, 22 and 27, 1995, the Subcommittee held 
hearings on the reauthorization and reform of the Superfund 
program, focusing on State and local perspectives; on business, 
insurance and contractor perspectives; on environmental and 
community group perspectives; on the perspectives of Members of 
Congress and on miscellaneous issues; and on Federal agency 
perspectives. A joint hearing was held on July 11, 1995, with 
the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation on 
natural resource damages under Superfund and the Oil Pollution 
Act. On November 2 and 8, 1995, hearings were held on H.R. 2500 
(Reform of Superfund Act). The bill was not considered by the 
Committee or the House before adjournment.
    On October 18, 1995, and December 5, 1995, the Subcommittee 
held hearings on H.R. 1856, the Natural Disaster Protection 
Partnership Act of 1995. Testimony was received from Members of 
Congress, the Administration, State representatives and other 
entities including insurers, homebuilders, homeowners, 
emergency response managers, consumer groups and others. The 
hearings were conducted to obtain information on preparedness, 
mitigation, response and recovery in reponse to emergencies and 
natural disasters such as seismic events (earthquakes and 
tsunamis), hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. No further action 
was taken.
    On January 29, 1996, a hearing was held on H.R. 2747, the 
Water Supply Infrastructure Assistance Act of 1995. This 
hearing was held to receive views of the Environmental 
Protection Agency; State and local governments and 
organizations involved in providing public water supplies and 
agricultural and environmental interests and the construction 
industry. The bill was modeled on the successful SRF 
established under the Clean Water Act and authorizes grants to 
States for establishment of new accounts within the SRFs for 
funding water supply infrastructure systems. The Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee ordered the bill reported with 
amendments on March 7, 1996. H.R. 2747 was included in H.R. 
3604, the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments which passed the 
House on June 25, 1996, and was signed into law as Public Law 
104-183.
    On March 28, 1996, the Subcommittee held a joint hearing 
with the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime 
Transportation on H.R. 2940, the Deepwater Port Modernization 
Act. The Subcommittee received testimony from Members of 
Congress, officials from the Department of Transportation and 
Coast Guard, State and local representatives, business 
representatives, and representatives from the environmental 
community. The Subcommittee received information on providing 
greater use of deepwater ports, improving competitiveness of 
the existing deepwater port, and encouraging the licensing and 
construction of additional deepwater ports. On June 27, 1996, 
the Subcommittee was discharged and the bill was ordered 
reported, as amended, by the Full Committee. H.R. 2940 passed 
the House on September 18, 1996, and was signed into law as 
part of Public Law 104-324.
    On July 17, 1996, a joint hearing was held with the Coast 
Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee on H.R. 3217, 
the National Invasive Species Act. Testimony was heard from 
Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the 
Corps of Engineers. Others testifying were vessel owners and 
operators and representatives of Port Authorities. The focus of 
the hearing was nonindigenous aquatic species that have moved 
beyond their native ranges and methods to prevent or control 
the introduction and spread of such species. The two 
Subcommittees were discharged and H.R. 3217 was ordered 
reported, as amended, by the Full Committee on September 12, 
1996, and referred to the Committee on Science and to the 
Committee on Resources on September 20, 1996. The House passed 
H.R. 3217 on September 24, 1996. The bill was later 
reintroduced and passed the House again as H.R. 4283 and was 
signed into law as Public Law 104-332.
    On September 11, 1996, a hearing was held on H.R. 3348, the 
Snow Removal Policy Act. The Subcommittee received testimony 
regarding FEMA's policies for providing assistance for snow 
removal and to discuss the blizzards and storms that occurred 
throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States during January 
and February 1996. The Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure ordered reported H.R. 3348, as amended, on 
September 12, 1996. The House passed the bill by voice vote on 
September 18, 1996.
                    SUMMARY OF OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES

    The Committee submitted its oversight plan to the 
Committees on Government Reform and Oversight and House 
Administration in accordance with Rule X, clause 2(d) of the 
Rules of the House. The following is a summary of the oversight 
plan and a summary of actions taken with respect to each. A 
more detailed discussion may be found under the section of this 
report entitled ``Summary of Activities''.
                                ------                                


                                AVIATION

    1. Federal Aviation Administration. The plan included 
evaluations of FAA operations, FAA safety programs, FAA's 
facilities and equipment program, the Airport Improvement 
Program, and the Airport and Airways Trust Fund. A number of 
days of hearings were held on these programs, including 
hearings on costs and benefits of FAA regulations, whether to 
restructure the air traffic control system as a private or 
government corporation, and preventing delays and cost overruns 
in FAA's global positioning system. The results of these 
hearings are reflected in legislation signed into law (Public 
Law 104-264) reauthorizing FAA programs for 2 years.
    2. Oversight of Activities of the Secretary of 
Transportation. A number of hearings dealt with the aviation 
functions of the Secretary of Transportation. For example, on 
July 20, 1995, the subcommittee held a hearing on aviation 
relations between the U.S. and Japan and on March 27 and April 
30, 1996, hearings were held on problems in the aviation 
relationship between the U.S. and the United Kingdom and Japan.
    3. Oversight of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
The Subcommittee held a hearing on March 6, 1996, on 
reauthorization of the NTSB. The NTSB Reauthorization Act was 
enacted into law as Public Law 104-291.
    4. Oversight of the Metropolitan Washington Airports. On 
February 9, 1995, the Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on 
the Metropolitan Washington airports and legislation was 
enacted as part of the FAA Reauthorization Act, reflecting the 
findings of the Subcommittee.

                          Additional Oversight

    Valujet: Between August 5 and August 16, 1996, the 
Committee investigative staff conducted a 2-week field 
examination of operations at the Atlanta and Dallas Flight 
Standards District offices operated by the FAA. Over the course 
of 7 days, staff interviewed 34 people, including 23 FAA 
employees, six employees of a repair station, and five 
employees of a major airline.
    This investigative trip was prompted by information 
developed during the Aviation Subcommittee's hearing on the 
crash of ValuJet Flight 592, which suggested flaws in the FAA's 
aviation safety oversight system. The examination was broadened 
into a more wide-ranging review of FAA safety oversight 
practices. The field examination allowed the committee to 
develop an understanding of the FAA's safety program to 
identify several broad topic areas which may be the subject of 
further examination by the Subcommittee.
    Denver Airport: The Subcommittee held a hearing entitled 
``Denver Airport: What Went Wrong'', looking at the actual cost 
and design of the airport versus the originally planned costs 
and design.
    Additional Safety Issues: The Subcommittee also conducted 
oversight and held hearings on sharing pilot performance 
records, child pilot safety, high performance takeoffs by 
military aircraft at civilian airports, child restraint 
systems, and aviation security and antiterrorism.
    Treatment of Families of Victims of Airline Accidents: The 
Subcommittee conducted oversight and held a hearing on the 
issue of the treatment of families of victims of airline 
accidents. This resulted in enactment of legislation in the FAA 
Authorization Act.
                                ------                                


                COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION

    1. Coast Guard. The plan included an evaluation of the 
effectiveness of the President's National Drug Control 
Strategy, oversight of the Coast Guard's roles and missions, 
oversight of the Oil Pollution Act, oversight of the Coast 
Guard's vessel safety programs, and oversight of the U.S. role 
in the International Maritime Organization.
    The Subcommittee held two hearings (one jointly with the 
Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control) examining the 
effectiveness of the President's National Drug Control Strategy 
and specifically the Coast Guard's drug interdiction program. 
While Administration witnesses strongly supported the Strategy, 
other witnesses were critical and concluded that the United 
States is losing the battle against illegal drugs.
    The Subcommittee held several days of hearings reviewing 
the Coast Guard's roles and missions and legislation was 
enacted reauthorizing Coast Guard programs through fiscal year 
1997. Included among these hearings was an examination of 
vessel traffic services and vessel safety.
    On July 7, 1995, the Subcommittee held a joint hearing with 
the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee on 
implementation of the natural resources damages programs under 
the Oil Pollution Act and under CERCLA. On June 26, 1996, the 
Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on Federal requirements 
for vessels to obtain certificates of financial responsibility.
    2. Maritime Administration. The plan included oversight of 
the U.S. Maritime Administration. The Subcommittee did not hold 
any hearings specifically covering the Maritime Administration.
    3. Federal Maritime Commission. The plan included oversight 
of the Shipping Act of 1984 and other activities of the FMC. 
The Subcommittee held a hearing on February 2, 1995, on the 
Shipping Act. The House passed H.R. 2149, deregulating ocean 
shipping and eliminating the need for the FMC.

                          Additional Oversight

    Jones Act: The Subcommittee held a hearing with a broad

               PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

    1. Economic Development Administration. The plan included 
evaluation of the eligibility criteria used to determine the 
basis for Economic Development Administration (EDA) assistance. 
The Subcommittee held hearings on February 10 and 22, 1995, 
which included oversight of EDA programs and an evaluation of 
the continued need for EDA programs. The Committee reported 
H.R. 2145, to reauthorize and reform both the programs of the 
EDA and the ARC for 5 years.
    2. Appalachian Regional Commission. The plan included 
evaluation of the basic programs under the Appalachian Regional 
Development Act. The Subcommittee held hearings on February 10 
and 22, of 1995, which included oversight of the Appalachian 
Regional Commission (ARC) and application of the ARC model to 
EDA programs. The Committee reported H.R. 2145, to reauthorize 
and reform the programs of both the EDA and the ARC for 5 
years.
    3. General Services Administration. The plan included 
evaluation of the capital asset program and the construction 
program, and a review of General Services Administration (GSA) 
property management services.
    The Subcommittee held several days of hearings on the 
capital investment plan during the course of the First and 
Second session of the 104th Congress. These hearings covered 
the capital investment plan including leasing and construction, 
as well as financing and long term acquisition strategies. For 
example, the Subcommittee held a hearing on the payment of 
stipends to construction bidders, and reviewed several 
particular construction requests. In addition, the Subcommittee 
specifically reviewed the courthouse construction program, 
which included a number of site visits and resulted in the 
deferment of approval of the FY 1996 courthouse construction 
program.
    In the wake of the bombing of the Federal building in 
Oklahoma, the Subcommittee also held a hearing and took under 
review Federal building security measures, following a visit to 
the Oklahoma site.
    During the Second session the Subcommittee initiated a 
review specifically of the leasing program, including scrutiny 
of several specific leases as well as an evaluation of GSA's 
plan to embark on a new approach to leasing which involved a 
plan to offer Federal agencies their choice of continuing to 
use GSA services or to receive their own authority to lease. 
The Subcommittee voiced its opposition to this effort until GSA 
can produce further findings of success with this approach.
    In addition, the Subcommittee has requested the General 
Accounting Office to conduct further detailed studies, and 
report its findings, on the Federal Triangle building project 
and the courthouse construction program.
    4. John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The plan 
included a review of the comprehensive capital improvement 
plan. The Subcommittee staff reviewed the plan and reported 
directly to the Chairman and Ranking Member, who are members of 
the Board of Trustees of the Center. The 5-year plan is 
currently in effect and reviewed quarterly by the Operations 
Committee of the Board.
    5. Smithsonian Institution. The plan included a review of 
progress on development of new museums. On September 11, 1996, 
the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 3933/S.1995, to 
authorize construction of the Smithsonian Institution National 
Air and Space Museum Dulles Center at Washington-Dulles 
International Airport, which was signed into law (Public Law 
104- 222). In addition, staff reviewed plans for the Museum of 
the American Indian.
    6. Architect of the Capitol. The plan included a review of 
the proposed visitors center and chiller addition. The 
Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 1230, the Capitol Visitor 
Center, on June 22, 1995. The hearing focused on the various 
design and construction aspects of the center, the financing of 
construction and related matters.

                          Additional Oversight

    Courthouse Construction: The Subcommittee conducted 
extensive oversight of the courthouse construction program, 
including 9 site visits and a number of hearings at which 
courthouse issues were raised. The Subcommittee concluded that 
the procedure GSA and the courts followed to select courthouse 
projects often results in courthouses that are either 
unnecessary or excessive. These conclusions resulted in the 
Subcommittee limiting funding for construction related finish 
work and detail on already approved projects and by not 
approving additional projects for site acquisition and design.
    NEXCOM: The Subcommittee conducted an investigation and 
held a hearing on a lease award for the Navy Exchange Service 
Command where the Navy had no authority to enter into the lease 
but GSA provided a retroactive delegation of leasing authority.
                                ------                                


                               RAILROADS

    1. Interstate Commerce Commission. The plan included an 
examination of the sunset of the ICC and disposition of its 
functions. The Subcommittee held hearings on January 26 and 
February 22, 1995, on sunsetting the Interstate Commerce 
Commission (ICC) and the subsequent transfer of any retained 
functions to other agencies. The Committee reported a bill 
(H.R. 2539) on November 1, 1995, which, among other things, 
transferred the rail merger jurisdiction to the newly created 
Surface Transportation Board within the DOT, and sunset the 
agency. This bill became Public Law 104-88.
    2. Amtrak. The plan included oversight of Amtrak's 
financial status and statutory mandates affecting Amtrak's 
costs. The Subcommittee held hearings on February 7, 10, and 
13, 1995, on the reauthorization of Amtrak. The hearings 
focused on Amtrak's financial position and operating 
impediments, and resulted in the Committee reporting to the 
House H.R. 1788. H.R. 1788, as amended, was passed by the House 
on November 30, 1995; however, no action was taken by the 
Senate.
    3. Overview of Railway Labor Act. The plan included review 
and application of the Railway Labor Act to commuter railroads, 
secondary picketing and the Dunlop Commission recommendations. 
The Subcommittee did not have an opportunity to address this 
review.
    4. Railroad Unemployment Insurance Modernization. The plan 
included a review of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance 
system, a Federal system of unemployment and sickness benefits 
unique to the railroad industry. As a result of a joint 
legislative proposal by labor and management to update and 
increase benefit levels in the 103rd Congress, the Railroad 
Unemployment Insurance Amendments Act of 1996 was enacted as 
Public Law 104-88.
    5. Railroad Safety ``user fees''. The plan included an 
intent to examine the impact of user fees on small railroads, 
and on the industry at large. The Subcommittee held a hearing 
on September 14, 1995, concerning the proposed renewal and 
expansion of Federal railroad safety user fees. The fees were 
not renewed.
    6. Local Rail Freight Assistance Program. The plan included 
a review of the Local Rail Freight Assistance Program, a 
program which provides matching funds to State and local 
governments for use in upgrading rail infrastructure. No 
specific oversight was conducted on this issue.
    7. Federal Employers Liability Act of 1908. The plan 
included an evaluation of Federal Employers Liability Act. The 
Subcommittee did not have the opportunity to conduct this 
evaluation.
    8. Railroad Retirement System. The plan included oversight 
of the Railroad Retirement System. No specific oversight was 
conducted on this issue.
    9. Railroad Safety Oversight. The plan included oversight 
of the railroad safety programs administered by the DOT's 
Federal Railroad Administration. In March 1996, the 
Subcommittee conducted oversight hearings on safety issues, 
particularly in response to the railroad accidents which 
occurred during the month of February.

                          Additional Oversight

    Rails to Trails: The Subcommittee conducted oversight and 
held two hearings on the Rails to Trails Act, which promotes 
conversion of abandoned railroad lines to recreational trails.
                                ------                                


                         SURFACE TRANSPORTATION

    1. Federal Highway and Federal Transit Administration. The 
plan included an evaluation of approval of the National Highway 
System (NHS); of burden inefficiencies and unfunded mandates in 
the Federal-aid highway, safety research and transit programs; 
of the DOT restructuring proposal; provisions of the Clean Air 
Act relating to surface transportation; effects of deregulation 
of State economic regulation of motor carriers of property; 
effects of implementation of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA); and reauthorization of the Intermodal 
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). In addition, it 
included oversight of fuel tax evasion and oversight of 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
    The Subcommittee held a series of six hearings on 
legislation to approve the NHS. The hearings ranged from 
examining mandates and burdens in the Federal-aid highway 
program to designation of the NHS. Within these hearings 
oversight was conducted on the ADA. These hearings eventually 
culminated in the timely enactment of the National Highway 
System Designation Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-59).
    In connection with reauthorization of ISTEA, the 
Subcommittee held 12 days of oversight hearings during the 
104th Congress, with the possibility of holding additional 
hearings in the 105th in preparation for reauthorizing ISTEA in 
1997. Within these hearings, issues concerning Clean Air Act 
provisions within the context of the CMAQ program were 
addressed; as well as oversight of fuel tax evasion within the 
discussion on the status of the Highway Trust Fund.
    Additionally, the Subcommittee held two field hearings, in 
Laredo and Pharr, Texas, to evaluate the impact of NAFTA.
    The effects of deregulation of State economic regulation of 
motor carriers of property was considered within the context of 
the review of the ICC.
    2. Research and Special Programs Administration. The plan 
included evaluation of Natural Gas and Hazardous Liquid 
Pipeline Safety Programs. The Subcommittee held a hearing on 
the reauthorization of the Natural Gas and Hazardous Liquid 
Pipeline Safety Act, which resulted in the enactment of the 
Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996 (Public 
Law 104-304).
    3. Interstate Commerce Commission. The plan included 
evaluation of elimination or transfer of certain ICC functions 
pertaining to motor carrier operations. The Subcommittee held a 
hearing on March 3, 1995, on the disposition of the motor 
carrier functions of the ICC. This effort, in combination with 
the review and considerations of the Railroads Subcommittee, 
resulted in legislation sunsetting the ICC in 1995 (Public Law 
104-88).

                          Additional Oversight

    LA Metro: On September 20, 1995, during consideration of 
H.R. 2274, the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, 
Representative George Miller offered an amendment to add a new 
section to the Act, section 354. Proposed section 354 would 
have prohibited the payment of safety and performance bonuses 
from the Highway Trust Fund and was prompted by allegations 
that safety bonuses had been paid to contractors by the Los 
Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority (LACMTA) in 
connection with the construction of the Red Line, 
notwithstanding the contractors' comparatively high reported 
rates of construction-related injuries. Responding to the 
concerns expressed by Representative Miller, Chairman Shuster 
directed Committee investigative staff to conduct an 
examination of the legal and policy questions relating to 
safety incentive programs.
    Committee staff conducted a 3-month long examination, 
interviewing more than 20 witnesses, reviewing extensive 
documentation and concluding that the LACMTA program was, in 
all material aspects, similar to safety incentive programs 
operated by other major transit authorities Nationwide and that 
LACMTA's safety record, as reflected in its Lost Time and OSHA 
200 Case Rates, was not materially different from that 
experienced by other benchmark transit authorities surveyed. 
Staff also noted that the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) 
did not provide any general guidance to transit grantees on the 
implementation of an effective safety incentive program and 
recommended that the Committee encourage FTA to provide 
guidelines on safety incentive programs as part of its overall 
program management and construction guidance for transit 
grantees.
                                ------                                


                    WATER RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT

    1. Army Corps of Engineers--Water Resources Program. The 
plan included a review of the Corps' efforts to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the organization and management 
of the water resources program; and the efforts of the Corps to 
improve the efficiency, effectiveness and fairness of the 
agency's regulatory program, especially in the area of wetlands 
and dredging activities. The Subcommittee held hearings in 
February 1995, and February and March 1996 in connection with 
the Water Resources Development Act and to review the water 
resources programs of the Army Corps of Engineers. As a result, 
H.R. 3592, The Water Resources Development Act of 1996, was 
reported from the Committee and passed the House in July 1996, 
and became Public Law 104-33.
    2. Environmental Protection Agency--Clean Water Act. The 
plan included a review of innovative financing and wastewater 
treatment methods; a review of market-based and watershed-based 
approaches to regulation; and a review of efforts to improve 
the management of storm water and nonpoint source pollution 
from inland and coastal areas. The Subcommittee held seven 
hearings, including a field hearing, in the spring of 1995, on 
the reauthorization of the Federal Water Pollution Act. The 
focus of these hearings ranged from addressing issues related 
to nonpoint source water policies to wetlands concerns; and 
testimony was received from all interested parties comprising 
the water policy community. The result of this effort 
culminated in the Clean Water Amendments of 1995, H.R. 961, 
which was reported from the Committee and passed the House in 
May 1995.
    3. Environmental Protection Agency--Superfund/CERCLA. The 
plan included a review of efforts to improve the efficiency, 
effectiveness and fairness of the cleanup process; a review of 
the liability and financing mechanisms under the current 
Superfund program; a review of the ground water protection 
provisions under the current Superfund program; and a review of 
the relationships among the States, Federal facilities and the 
EPA, in conducting Superfund cleanups. The Subcommittee held 
seven hearings throughout 1995 on the reauthorization and 
reform of the Superfund program. The Subcommittee received and 
reviewed testimony from all parties interested in Superfund.
    4. Federal Emergency Management Agency--Disaster Relief 
Program. The plan included a review of hazard mitigation 
activities currently being promoted by FEMA; review of disaster 
response efforts by FEMA; and a review of efforts to improve 
the insurance available for catastrophic natural disasters. The 
Subcommittee held 2 days of hearings on H.R. 1856, the Natural 
Disaster Protection Partnership Act of 1995, at which testimony 
was taken from a wide variety of witnesses on preparedness, 
mitigation, response and recovery in response to emergencies 
and natural disasters. In addition, the Subcommittee held a 
hearing on H.R. 3348, the Snow Removal Policy Act which 
examined FEMA's policy for providing assistance for snow 
removal in snow emergencies.
    5. Coast Guard--Oil Pollution Act. The plan included a 
review, along with the Coast Guard and Maritime Subcommittee, 
of the oil spill liability provisions and insurability 
requirements under OPA; and a review of oil spill technologies 
and response mechanisms now available within the industry. The 
Subcommittee held a joint hearing with the Subcommittee on 
Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation on natural resource 
damages under Superfund and the Oil Pollution Act on July 11, 
1995.
    6. Tennessee Valley Authority. The plan included a review 
of the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) energy generation 
program and the impact of TVA debt on its rate payers. No 
oversight was conducted on this issue.
