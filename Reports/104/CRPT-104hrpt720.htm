    The resolution waives clause 4(b) of rule XI (requiring a 
two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is 
reported from the Rules Committee) against a resolution 
reported by the Rules Committee before August 1, 1996. The rule 
applies the waiver to special rules providing for consideration 
or disposition of a conference report to accompany H.R. 3734, 
the Personal Responsibility Act of 1996.
