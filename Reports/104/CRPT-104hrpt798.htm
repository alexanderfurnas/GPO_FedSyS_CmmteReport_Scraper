     The Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property 
exercises the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary to 
oversee the operation of the federal judiciary. H.R. 3968, the 
``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996'', is designed to 
improve administration and procedures, eliminate operational 
inefficiencies, and, to the extent prudent, reduce judicial 
operating expenses.
     The bill affects a wide range of judicial branch programs 
and operations. The reappointment procedure of bankruptcy 
judges is simplified. Provisions affecting court reporters, 
court interpreters, and employees of the Administrative Office 
the United States Courts are included. The bill corrects 
inconsistencies in the operation of the Judicial Survivors' 
Annuities System. Civil action filing fees and other user fees 
are increased for the first time in 10 years. Clarifications of 
statutory removal and venue provisions are made. The bill also 
addresses several personnel provisions affecting court 
employees.

                Background and Need for the Legislation

     The Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. Moorhead, and the ranking 
minority Member, Mrs. Schroeder, introduced H.R. 1989, the 
``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1995,'' on June 30, 1995. 
The bill was introduced at the request of the Judicial 
Conference of the United States.
     The Judicial Conference is the policy making body of the 
federal judiciary, and through a committee system evaluates 
court operations. The Judicial Conference is supported by the 
Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Also, the 
circuit judicial councils of the regional districts have 
statutory responsibility for certain administrative and 
operational matters. The provisions of H.R. 1989 were developed 
within the judiciary and approved by the Judicial Conference.
     After the hearing held by the Subcommittee on Courts and 
Intellectual Property on H.R. 1989 on March 14, 1996, the 
Subcommittee marked up and favorably reported a committee 
print, that represented a scaled back version of H.R. 1989. The 
committee print was then introduced as a clean bill, H.R. 3968, 
the ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996.'' The provisions 
in H.R. 3968 address administrative, financial, personnel, 
organizational and technical changes that are needed by the 
Federal courts and their supporting agencies. These provisions 
are designed to have a positive impact on the operations of the 
federal courts and enhance the delivery of justice in the 
federal system.

                                Hearings

     The Committee's Subcommittee on Courts and intellectual 
Property held a hearing on H.R. 1989, the ``Federal Courts 
Improvement Act of 1995'' on March 14, 1996, in Room B-352 
Rayburn House Office Building. Testifying on behalf of the 
Judicial Conference of the United States were: Judge Stephen 
Anderson, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; Judge 
Emmett Cox, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit; and 
Judge Barefoot Sanders, U.S. District Court of the Northern 
District of Texas. Also presenting testimony were Judge W. Earl 
Britt, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North 
Carolina, on behalf of the Federal Judges Association and

behalf of the American Bar Association.

                        Committee Consideration

    On July 23, 1996, the Subcommittee on Courts and 
Intellectual Property met in open session to markup a Committee 
print that represented a scaled-back version of H.R. 1989. The 
Committee print was ordered reported by voice vote, a quorum 
being present. On August 2, 1996, the committee print was then 
introduced as a clean bill, H.R. 3968. On September 11, 1996, 
the Committee met in open session and ordered reported the bill 
H.R. 3968, as amended, by a voice vote, a quorum being present.

                      Committee Oversight Findings

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee reports 
that the findings and recommendations of the Committee, based 
on oversight activities under clause 2(b)(1) of rule X of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, are incorporated in the 
descriptive portions of this report.

         Committee on Government Reform and Oversight Findings

    No findings or recommendations of the Committee on 
Government Reform and Oversight were received as referred to in 
clause 2(l)(3)(D) of rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives.

               New Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures

     Clause 2(l)(3)(B) of House rule XI is inapplicable because 
this legislation does not provide new budgetary authority or 
increased tax expenditures.

               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(C)(3) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee sets 
forth, with respect to the bill, H.R. 3968, the following 
estimate and comparison prepared by the Director of the 
Congressional Budget Office under section 403 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974:

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                Washington, DC, September 16, 1996.
Hon. Henry J. Hyde,
 Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 3968, the Federal 
Courts Improvement Act of 1996.
    Enacting H.R. 3968 would affect direct spending. Therefore, 
pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to the bill.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.
    Enclosure.

               congressional budget office cost estimate

    1. Bill number: H.R. 3968.
    2. Bill title: Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996.
    3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the House Committee 
on the Judiciary on September 11, 1996.
    4. Bill purpose: H.R. 3968 would make numerous operational 
and administrative changes to the federal court system. 
Provisions that would have significant budgetary effects 
include section 306, which would allow the terms of certain 
bankruptcy judgeships to be extended, and sections 401 and 404, 
which would increase offsetting receipts and the spending of 
such receipts by increasing civil filing fees and other 
miscellaneous fees.
    5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates 
that enacting H.R. 3968 would increase discretionary spending 
by about $2 million over the 1997-2002 period, subject to the 
availability of appropriated funds, and would increase 
mandatory spending by $1 million over the same period. The 
following table summarizes the estimated budgetary impact of 
the bill.

    The cost of this bill fall within budget function 750.

Basis of estimate

            Title I
    Section 101 of this title would allow probation officers 
and pretrial officers to carry firearms with the approval of 
federal district courts and according to the rules and 
regulations prescribed by the Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts (AOUSC). Currently, the Judicial 
Conference of the United States maintains an informal policy 
that enables these officers to carry firearms if allowed under 
existing state and local law. As a result of this policy, a 
firearms training program is in operation and surplus firearms 
from other agencies are provided to the officers in the 
program. Thus far, overall expenses for this program have been 
minimal. According to the AOUSC, about 60 percent of the 
probation officers and pretrial services officers currently 
carry firearms, and enacting this bill would probably not 
increase participation in the firearms programs significantly. 
Thus, CBO estimates that enacting this provision would not have 
a significant budgetary impact.
            Title II
    Because section 208 would allow civil actions and criminal 
actions against federal agencies and federal officers to be 
removed from state court to a federal district court, enacting 
this provision could affect the number of cases that are tried 
in federal courts. However, according to the national Center 
for State Courts, very few of these cases are currently tried 
in state court. Hence, CBO estimates that enacting this 
provision would not significantly increase the federal caseload 
and thus would not have any significant impact on the federal 
budget.
    CBO estimates that the other changes contained in this 
title that would affect judicial process would have no 
significant budgetary impact.
            Title III
    Section 305 would require the courts, subject to the 
availability of appropriated funds, to provide sign-language 
interpreters as necessary during any type of judicial 
proceeding. Under current law, such services are provided in 
some cases. Based on information from the AOUSC, CBO estimates 
that it would cost the courts about $40,000 annually to provide 
court interpreters in additional cases.
    Section 306 would amend the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 
1992 (Public Law 102-361), which created 10 temporary judgeship 
positions and required that the next vacancy in each of the 10 
affected district courts occurring five years after the 
effective date of the act (August 26, 1992) not be filled. 
Enacting section 309 would change the controlling date for 
leaving vacancies unfilled to five years after the confirmation 
date of the temporary judge, rather than five years after the 
effective date of the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1992. Based 
on information from the AOUSC, CBO estimates that over the next 
five years about two more workyears for judges would be 
incurred under the bill than under current law. We estimate 
that enacting section 309 would result in about $1 million in 
new mandatory spending from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal 
year 2002 for salaries and benefits of judges. Salaries and 
benefits for support personnel and other expenditures related 
to the judgeships, which would require an appropriation, are 
estimated to cost about $2 million over the same period.
    The other sections of this title would make various changes 
that would affect the salaries and benefits for judiciary 
personnel. However, based on information from the AOUSC, CBO 
does not estimate that any of those changes would affect a 
significant number of judicial personnel. Thus, CBO estimates 
that neither discretionary nor mandatory spending would 
significantly increase by enacting these sections.
            Title IV
    Two of the four sections under this title would increase 
offsetting collections and the spending of such receipts. 
Section 401 would increase the filing fee for filing a civil 
action in district court from $120 to $150. Also, this section 
would increase the portion of this fee that would be deposited 
into the special judiciary fund in the Treasury to be used to 
finance activities of the AOUSC. Currently, this fund retains 
$60 of the $120 fee and enacting this section would require 
that an additional $30 (that is, $90 of the $150 fee) be 
deposited into this fund. According to the AOUSC, filing fees 
are paid in about 220,000 civil actions each year. Thus, CBO 
estimates that enacting this section would increase offsetting 
collections by about $7 million each year, beginning in 1997.
    Section 404 would allow the judiciary to retain revenue 
from future increases in fees paid for attorney's admission to 
the federal district bar, duplicate admission certificates, 
certificates of good standing, and filing an adversary 
complaint in bankruptcy cases. CBO expects that the Judicial 
Conference of the United States would increase such fees 
following enactment of this bill. We estimate the increase 
would generate about $3 million in offsetting collections each 
year. Because these collections as well as the amounts 
collected under section 401 would be spent without 
appropriations action, CBO estimates that enacting these 
provisions would have no net impact on the federal budget.
            Titles V and VI
    Titles V and VI would change the system for selecting the 
chief judge of the Court of International Trade and would 
establish the southern district of New York and the eastern 
district of Texas for holding court. CBO estimates that 
enacting those provisions would not result in any significant 
cost to the federal government.
            Title VII
    Section 705 would abolish the Special Court that was 
established under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 
to oversee the reorganization of insolvent railroads. The 
court's current proceedings, which consist of less than 10 
cases, and any future cases would be transferred to the 
district court for the District of Columbia. Based on 
information from the AOUSC, CBO estimates that eliminating this 
court would result in annual cost savings of about $200,000, 
assuming that appropriations were reduced accordingly.
    Section 708 would extend the authorization for 
appropriations from fiscal year 1997 to 1998 for the use of 
arbitration by certain district courts. Based on historical 
expenditures for the arbitration program. CBO estimates that 
the district courts would require an appropriation for this 
purpose of about $500,000 in fiscal year 1998.
    6. Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the 
Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets 
up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct 
spending or receipts through 1998. The various fee increases 
under Title IV would affect direct spending. However, because 
these fees, which are recorded as offsetting collections, would 
be mostly spent in the same year in which they are collected, 
CBO estimates that enacting the fee provisions would have no 
significant net impact on direct spending in each year. Because 
additional mandatory spending for the salaries and benefits for 
bankruptcy judges would not begin until fiscal year 1999, these 
amounts would not affect pay-as-you-go scoring.

    7. Estimated impact on State, local and tribal governments: 
H.R. 3968 contains two intergovernmental mandates as defined in 
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4). 
CBO estimates that the aggregate net cost of these mandates of 
state, local, and tribal governments would total, at most, $1 
million annually--well below the $50 million threshold 
established in Public Law 104-4.
    Preemption of certain state and local gun laws.--The bill 
would preempt some state and local laws by authorizing federal 
pretrial and probation officers to carry guns. According to 
information from the AOUSC, at least one state prohibits 
pretrial officers from carrying concealed weapons. In addition, 
many of these officials who must travel across state and 
municipal borders find that their existing state authorization 
is not always legal in bordering areas. (Generally there is a 
residency requirement to obtain a permit to carry a gun in an 
area.)
    The regulations implementing this provision would also 
preclude the need for these federal officials to obtain permits 
or licenses from state and local governments. Currently, 
federal pretrial and probation officers pay gun permit fees in 
three states. Reductions in fee revenues would be slightly 
offset by savings in administrative costs. CBO estimates that 
providing these officials federal authorization to carry guns 
would result in a net loss of revenues for state and local 
governments totaling less than $2,000 per year.
    Increase in civil action filing fees.--The bill would 
increase the fee that parties, including state, local, and 
tribal governments, must pay to file civil actions in U.S. 
district courts. H.R. 3968 would raise the fee to $150 per 
filing (an increase $30). According to the AOUSC, only a 
fraction of the 220,000 such cases filed annually are filed by 
state, local, or tribal governments. CBO estimates the costs to 
these governments of complying with the fee increase would be 
less than $1 million per year.
    8. Estimated impact on the private sector: H.R. 3968 would 
impose new private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law 
104-4. First section 401 would increase the filing fee that 
parties who institute civil actions in federal district are 
required to pay. That fee would be increased to $150 from its 
current law amount of $120. Second, section 402 would authorize 
the Director of the AOUSC to develop a performance-based system 
of certification for court interpreters, and to change fees to 
interpreters for purposes of obtaining certification.
    CBO estimates that the direct costs associated with new 
private-sector mandates in the bill would fall well below the 
$100 million threshold specified in Public Law 104-4. 
Increasing the civil action filing fee would result in 
additional payments by the private sector of about $7 million 
per year. Authorizng the AOUSC Director to develop a 
certification system for court interpreters and to charge 
testing fees would essentially codify existing practices. Thus, 
the direct cost of section 402 would be zero.
    9. Previous CBO estimate: On September 6, 1996, CBO 
transmitted a cost estimate for S. 1887, the Federal Courts 
Improvement Act of 1996, as reported by the Senate Committee on 
the Judiciary on July 30, 1996. H.R. 3968 is similar to S. 
1887. The only significant difference between the two bills 
that affects their cost is that S. 1887 would authorize 
appropriations for the State Justice Institute while H.R. 3968 
does not contain that authorization.
    10. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Susanne S. 
Mehlman; State and local government impact: Karen McVey; 
private sector impact: Matthew Eyles.
    11. Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine, Paul N. Van 
de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.

                     Inflationary Impact Statement

     Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that H.R. 
3968 will have no significant inflationary impact on prices and 
costs in the national economy.

                      Section-by-Section Analysis

         title i--criminal law and criminal justice amendments

Sec. 101. New authority for probation and pretrial services officers

    This section provides federal authority for probation and 
pretrial services officers to carry firearms under rules 
prescribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts, if approved by the appropriate district 
court.
    Probation and pretrial services officers may presently 
carry weapons under circumstances specified by the Judicial 
Conference only if state law permits. In some jurisdictions, 
state law prohibits or limits these officers from carrying 
weapons, even where the officer has federal court approval to 
do so. In those states, the personal security of these officers 
is being compromised. Without a federal statute authorizing 
officers to carry firearms, these officers can encounter legal 
problems in crossing state lines while performing their duties. 
For example, when an officer is working in the community 
supervising offenders near a state border, the officer's state 
authorization to carry firearms may not be legal if the officer 
should cross a state border while conducting normal supervision 
activities. An offender may have a nearby job in an adjacent 
state and the officer must travel to the job site to verify the 
employment. Lack of federal authorization to carry firearms can 
also have fiscal consequences. In Puerto Rico, for example, 
officers must pay a license fee of several hundred dollars to 
carry firearms.
    There are sound reasons supporting a federal law to 
supersede state law. This section corrects the situation in 
which the security of federal probation and pretrial services 
officers is left to the vagaries of state law. The section 
removes the uncertainty of the authority of officers who are 
required to cross state lines in the course of their duties. It 
also clarifies the removability from state court of a civil 
action arising out of the use of a firearm by an officer under 
28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442. The firearms are to be carried pursuant to 
regulations promulgated by the Director of the Administrative 
Office. These regulations would include extensive training and 
safety requirements, most of which are already in effect for 
those officers authorized to carry firearms.
    Congress has addressed and remedied this problem for the 
employees of other federal government agencies involved in the 
criminal justice system, e.g., Bureau of Prisons, 18 U.S.C. 
Sec. 3050; Drug Enforcement Administration, 21 U.S.C. Sec. 878; 
Environmental Protection Agency, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3063; Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3052; Postal Service, 
18 U.S.C. Sec. 3061; Secret Service, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3056; U.S. 
Marshals Service, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3053. This section provides 
identical legal treatment for federal probation and pretrial 
officers.

                title ii--judicial process improvements

Sec. 201. Duties of magistrate judge on emergency assignment

    This section authorizes magistrate judges temporarily 
assigned to another judicial district because of an emergency 
to dispose of civil cases with the consent of the parties. This 
authority is already possessed by magistrate judges sitting in 
their own districts. Magistrate judges serving on emergency 
assignment, therefore, would have the same authority in this 
regard as those serving in regular status.
    Section 636(f) of title 28 permits the temporary assignment 
of a magistrate judge from one judicial district to another in 
emergency situations upon the concurrence of the chief judges 
of the districts involved. The magistrate judge may perform 
duties specified in section 636(a) and (b). Subsection (f) was 
added to the Federal Magistrates Act in 1972. The civil consent 
provisions in section 636(c) were enacted in 1979, subsequent 
to the enactment of the emergency provisions. It would appear 
that through oversight no corresponding subsection (f) 
amendment was made in 1979 to permit magistrate judges on 
emergency assignment in another district to enter judgment in 
civil cases upon the consent of the parties. Accordingly, this 
section corrects that oversight.

Sec. 202. Registration of judgments for enforcement in other districts

    This section clarifies that in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1963, a 
judgment in an action for recovery of money or property that 
was entered in a court of appeals or a bankruptcy court may 
also be registered for enforcement purposes in any district. 
Such judgments of a district court are currently covered by 
this statute. As a practical matter, bankruptcy courts, as 
adjuncts to the district courts, have been relatively 
unaffected by the present law specifying the district court. 
However, this change is necessary to clarify the statute as to 
bankruptcy courts and to enable courts of appeals judgments to 
be registered for enforcement in other districts. This need 
arises at the appellate level especially in the enforcement of 
administrative law orders which have been appealed to the 
courts of appeals, but are to be enforced at the district 
level.

Sec. 203. Vacancy in clerk position; absence of clerk

    While it might be thought self-evident that deputy clerks 
may act for the clerk of court whenever the clerk is unable to 
perform official duties for any reason, the current language of 
28 U.S.C. Sec. 954 speaks only to deputy clerks acting in lieu 
of a deceased clerk. This section amends section 954 to clarify 
that deputy clerks may act whenever the clerk cannot perform 
his or her official duties. It also permits the court to 
designate an acting clerk of court, when it is expected that 
the clerk will be unavailable or the office of clerk will be 
vacant for a prolonged period. This section also deletes an 
obsolete provision in section 954 relating to the compensation 
of a deceased clerk of the Supreme Court. A conforming 
amendment changes the chapter's table of contents.

Sec. 204. Removal of cases against the United States and Federal 
        officers or agencies

    This section allows civil actions and criminal prosecutions 
against federal agencies as well as those against federal 
officers sued in either an individual or official capacity to 
be removed to federal district court. A federal forum in such 
cases is important since state court actions against federal 
agencies and officers often involve complex federal issues and 
federal-state conflicts. This bill legislatively reverses the 
Supreme Court's decision in International Primate Protection 
League, et al. v. Administrators of Tulane Educational Fund, et 
al., 111 S.Ct. 1700 (1991), which held that only federal 
officers, not federal agencies, may remove state court actions 
to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442(a)(1).
    This section also reverses at least three lower court 
decisions, viz., Western Securities v. Derwinski, 937 F.2d 1276 
(7th Cir. 1991); American Policyholders Insurance Company v. 
Nyacol, 989 F.2d 1256 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 
682 (1994), and Turner v. Espy, 863 F. Supp. 1198 (D. Haw. 
1994), which held that federal officers sued exclusively in 
their official capacities cannot remove state court actions to 
federal court. The holdings in those cases directly contravened 
the statutory language. The result of these decisions has been 
that federal agencies have had to defend themselves in state 
court, despite important and complex federal issues such as 
preemption and sovereign immunity. Note that under the change 
made in this section, cases would be removable only where 
federal officers are acting pursuant to a federal law.
    This section fulfills Congress' intent that questions 
concerning the exercise of federal authority, the scope of 
federal immunity and federal-state conflicts be adjudicated in 
federal court. It also clarifies that suits against federal 
agencies, as well as those against federal officers sued in 
either an individual or official capacity, may be removed to 
federal district court. This section does not alter the 
requirement that a federal law defense be alleged for a suit to 
be removable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1442(a)(1).

Sec. 205. Appeal route in civil cases decided by magistrate judges with 
        consent

    In cases where parties to a civil action have consented to 
case- dispositive authority of a magistrate judge, current law 
permits an appeal of the judgment directly to the court of 
appeals or, as an alternative if the parties agree, to a 
district judge followed by discretionary review in the court of 
appeals.
    This section eliminates the alternative route of appeal to 
the district judge, as recommended in the Judicial Conference's 
Long Range Plan for the Federal Courts. Although intended as a 
less-expensive means of obtaining appellate review, this 
alternative appeal route is inconsistent with the principle 
underlying the ``consent'' authority of magistrate judges--that 
the parties agree to disposition of their case without 
involving a district judge. A single forum of appeal in civil 
consent cases simplifies court procedures and recognizes the 
existing practice in most districts. When the statistics were 
last analyzed in preparation of the Long Range Plan, for the 
two year period from July 1, 1991 through June 30, 1993, only 
three percent of the civil consent cases disposed of by 
magistrate judges (338 out of 12,219) were appealed to a 
district judge. These appeals to district judges occurred in 
only 33 of the 94 district courts, 18 of which experienced only 
one appeal and another seven experienced only two or three such 
appeals. Moreover, the dual system of appeals has led to 
confusion among litigants, with some parties appealing to the 
wrong forum and others failing to recognize that appeal to a 
district judge might bar rights of further appeal. See, e.g., 
Stull v. Sec. of Health and Human Services, 749 F.2d 9 (6th 
Cir. 1984) (no automatic right to appeal to court of appeals 
after parties chose to appeal to district court); Webster v. 
Spraying Systems, 727 F. Supp. 381 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (case 
improperly before district judge where parties elected to 
appeal directly to court of appeals). This section does not 
alter the role of magistrate judges as adjuncts to Article III 
courts since district judges would still control the referral 
of consent cases to magistrate judges.

Sec. 206. Reports by judicial councils relating to misconduct and 
        disability orders

    This section requires each Judicial Council to submit an 
annual report to the Administrative Office of the United States 
Courts on the number and nature of orders relating to judicial 
misconduct or disability under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 332. This 
reporting requirement was recommended by the Report of the 
National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal (August 
1993), which found that reliable information concerning Council 
orders was difficult to obtain.

Sec. 207. Consent to trial in certain criminal actions

    Under current law, United States magistrate judges have 
jurisdiction to try misdemeanor cases, but persons charged with 
a misdemeanor may elect to be tried before the district judge 
in those cases. Trial by the magistrate judge can occur only 
when the defendant files a written consent to that trial.
    Under this section, certain petty offenses could be tried 
by the magistrate judge without the consent of the defendant, 
and in those cases in which consent would continue to be 
required, that consent could be made either in writing or 
orally on the record.
    Specifically, this section would permit trial by the 
magistrate judge without consent in the following cases:
          Petty offenses that are infractions, punishable by 
        imprisonment of five days or less;
          Petty offenses that are Class C misdemeanors, 
        punishable by imprisonment of thirty days or less; and
          Petty offenses that are Class B misdemeanors charging 
        a motor vehicle violation, punishable by imprisonment 
        of six months or less.
    For all other misdemeanors, including non-motor vehicle 
violations that are Class B misdemeanors, trial could occur 
before the magistrate judge, as happens under the law now in 
effect, with consent. This section does change the consent 
provision to permit consent to be made orally on the record as 
well as in writing.

TITLE III--JUDICIARY PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION, BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS

Sec. 301. Refund of contribution for deceased deferred annuitant under 
        the Judicial Survivors' Annuities System

    This section is a technical amendment to 28 U.S.C. 
Sec. 376(o)(1) addressing a contingency not addressed under the 
current statute relating to officials who retire on deferred 
annuities, i.e., what happens if a judicial official retires on 
a deferred annuity and agrees to continue Judicial Survivors' 
Annuities System (JSAS) contributions during the period between 
leaving office and commencement of the annuity, but either dies 
before making the requisite 18 months of contributions for 
vesting purposes (a possibility for individuals who join JSAS 
during an ``open season'' and retire shortly thereafter) or 
dies without eligible survivors. Under the current statute, in 
cases where a judicial official dies without eligible survivors 
or before his or her JSAS benefits have become vested, a lump 
sum payment of contributions, with interest, is made to 
designated beneficiaries if the judicial official ``dies while 
in office, or while receiving `retirement pay' ''. This 
amendment applies the same policy to a judicial official who 
dies between the time of retirement and commencement of annuity 
payments.

Sec. 302. Bankruptcy judges reappointment procedure

    This section amends the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal 
Judgeship Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-353, Sec. 120, as amended 
by Pub. L. No. 99-554, Sec. 102, 100 Stat. 3089, to authorize 
the Judicial Conference to prescribe regulations which provide 
for the reappointment of incumbent bankruptcy judges that 
differ from the initial appointment of bankruptcy judges.
    The Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 
articulated strict, specifically detailed ethical and 
scholastic standards for the selection of United States 
bankruptcy judges to ensure that such selections are governed 
by merit, character, and scholastic ability. This Act also 
requires the judicial council for each circuit, or a merit 
selection panel, if so convened by the council, to screen and 
review the qualifications of applicants, using strict criteria 
specified both by the Act and by accompanying regulations 
issued by the Judicial Conference of the United States. These 
procedures are thorough and time-consuming, both for the 
applicants and the reviewers. These procedures are unnecessary, 
however, in the case of applicants who are incumbent bankruptcy 
judges. The information regarding an incumbent's merit, 
scholarship, judicial temperament, etc., is no longer a matter 
which a judicial council or a merit selection screening panel 
need attempt to ascertain; they are facts, amply supported by a 
fourteen-year-old record. Thus, this section simply eliminates 
unnecessary expenditures of time and money.
    The expectation is that a system similar to that utilized 
for incumbent magistrate judges would be established, i.e., if 
the appointing court of appeals determines that a reappointment 
is appropriate, then it publishes its intention to reappoint 
the incumbent and seeks public comment on the incumbent's 
record. The judge's performance is reviewed, as well as any 
comments received, and a report is forwarded to the court of 
appeals, which then decides whether to reappoint. If the court 
of appeals decides not to reappoint, then the normal recruiting 
and selection procedures begin.
    The 1984 Act sought to eliminate any constitutional 
concerns from the 1978 Act, as expressed in Northern Pipeline 
Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50 (1982). 
The concern at that time was to continue the then-incumbent 
bankruptcy judges in office and to encourage their 
reappointment when their existing terms expired. The failure to 
provide provisions concerning the reappointment of future 
incumbents (i.e., incumbents reappointed after the filling of 
first vacancies following the 1984 Act) with waiver of the 
fact-finding procedures appears to be an oversight. Thus, this 
section is more in the nature of a technical correction. This 
change also provides uniformity in the procedures for 
reappointing incumbent bankruptcy judges with that of 
magistrate judges.

Sec. 303. Technical correction related to commencement date of 
        temporary judgeships

    When the Federal Judgeship Act was passed in 1990, it 
created, among other things, both permanent judgeships and a 
temporary judgeship in two district courts, the Eastern 
District of Missouri and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
This section eliminates potential confusion about the date on 
which the temporary judgeship will lapse. When these judgeship 
positions have been filled, the source of the position has been 
identified as the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 without 
specifying whether the position being filled is the permanent 
or the temporary position.
    The amended language of the 1990 Act creating temporary 
judgeships specifies that the first vacancy occurring five 
years after the confirmation of the judge appointed to fill the 
position shall not be filled. Without more specificity on which 
of the judgeships is the temporary position, uncertainty exists 
as to the date on when the position will lapse.
    This section eliminates that confusion by specifying that 
the last of the judgeships (created by this Act in these two 
districts) filled shall be the temporary position. In this 
manner, the legislation will more fully comport with the intent 
of the temporary judgeship positions by assuring that the 
courts have the benefit of those temporary judgeships for at 
least the five year period specified in the Act.

Sec. 304. Full-time status of court reporters

    This section corrects an inequity caused by the unique 
nature of court reporter work that unjustly penalizes court 
reporters at retirement. Sections 8339(o) and 8415(e) of title 
5 were added in 1986 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
of 1985 to eliminate the availability of windfall retirement 
annuities for part-time employees. The Office of Personnel 
Management has issued a formal opinion which could deprive 
court reporters who are not on a regularly scheduled 40 hour 
weekly tour of duty in the courthouse of a full retirement 
annuity, irrespective of receipt of a full-time salary and 
concomitant full retirement contributions. Under this opinion, 
court reporters who wish to receive a retirement annuity based 
upon ``full-time'' service (as opposed to part-time service and 
a resulting reduction in annuity) must either (a) work a 
scheduled tour of duty in the courthouse of 80 hours per pay 
period; or (b) maintain records of the actual hours worked on 
federal business and work a minimum of 2080 hours per year on 
that business. However, court reporters work irregular hours 
and may not work the entire 40 hours in the courthouse. This 
section remedies this by providing that court reporters who are 
paid a full-time salary will be treated like full-time 
employees for retirement purposes.
    In order that annuities not be reduced solely due to the 
lack of a regularly scheduled tour of duty if the reporter is 
paid a full salary as fixed by the Judicial Conference, the 
Conference in September 1988 recommended the proposed 
legislative change to define court reporters as ``full-time'' 
employees for annuity purposes if they are paid full-time 
salaries.

Sec. 305. Court interpreters

    This section cures what was an unanticipated statutory 
restriction on the federal courts' ability to respond to the 
needs of hearing-impaired persons participating in court 
proceedings. The Court Interpreters Act at 28 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1827(d)(1) and (e)(2) authorizes the provision of paid 
interpreting services to the hearing-impaired (as well as to 
non-English speakers), but only to parties and witnesses and 
only in criminal cases or civil actions instituted by the 
United States. At 28 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1827(g)(4) and 1828(b) 
(with regard to special interpretation services), the Act 
provides that such services may be provided in other 
proceedings with the approval of the presiding judicial 
officer, but only on a cost-reimbursable basis.
    Especially in recent years, since the enactment of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, hearing-impaired persons in a 
variety of circumstances, such as debtors in bankruptcy cases, 
parties in private civil cases, attorneys representing private 
clients, and others, have requested federal courts to provide 
them with sign language interpreters so that they may 
meaningfully participate in court proceedings. No matter how 
sympathetic a presiding judge may be to such requests, however, 
because of the restriction in the Court Interpreters Act, the 
courts have been limited to providing this service on a 
reimbursable basis.
    This section promotes accommodation to this class of 
disabled persons by vesting judicial officers with the 
discretion to provide sign language interpreters at court 
expense, subject to the availability of funds, to any 
participant in any type of judicial proceeding. The Committee 
contemplates that discretion under subsection (l) will be 
exercised sparingly to advance the interests of justice. The 
presiding officer, of course, must consider the availability of 
appropriated funds before exercising discretion under 
subsection (l) to appoint a sign language interpreter and avoid 
making such an appointment under this subsection in the absence 
of funds to pay for the services. Other provisions of the Court 
Interpreters Act remain unchanged, however, so that the 
provision of interpretation services for government witnesses, 
for example, remains the financial responsibility of the 
Department of Justice under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1827(g)(3).

Sec. 306. Technical amendment related to commencement date of temporary 
        bankruptcy judgeships

    Temporary judgeships were first established for bankruptcy 
judges in the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1992 (the 1992 Act), 
which authorized ten temporary judgeship positions. Temporary 
judgeship positions are intended to provide a court with a 
needed judgeship for a minimum of five years. However, the 
language of section 3(b) of the 1992 Act followed language used 
for Article III judges, which provided that a vacancy occurring 
five years or more after the date of the enactment of the Act 
shall not be filled.
    By linking the temporary judgeship terms (5 years) to the 
enactment date of a particular judgeship act, a district could 
lose most or all of the benefit of an authorized temporary 
judgeship position. The period between the effective date of a 
particular judgeship act and the time new judges actually take 
office to fill newly-created positions is often years, due to 
delays in funding and selection processes.
    The Article III judiciary has had temporary judgeships for 
years and has struggled with the harsh effects of linking the 
five-year period to the date of enactment of the particular 
judgeship act. Congress recognized this problem and passed 
legislation to amend the commencement date of certain temporary 
Article III judgeships. Pub. Law 104-60.

Sec. 307. Contribution rate for senior judges under the Judicial 
        Survivors' Annuities System

    This section corrects an anomaly between categories of 
disabled judges and their rate of contribution to the Judicial 
Survivors' Annuities System (JSAS) and provides equal treatment 
for all disabled judges. Currently, a senior judge who is 
disabled and retires under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 371(b) (senior 
status) contributes to the JSAS at a rate of 2.2 percent. 
However, a disabled judge who retires under 28 U.S.C. 
Sec. 372(a) (permanent disability) contributes to JSAS at a 
rate of 3.5 percent unless he or she is ``willing and able'' to 
work. This section applies a 2.2 percent contribution rate to 
all senior Article III judges and all retired judges of the 
United States Court of Federal Claims.

Sec. 308. Proceedings on complaints against judicial conduct

    This section amends section 372(c) of title 28, United 
States Code, to provide that complaints filed in one judicial 
circuit shall be referred to another judicial circuit for 
proceedings under this subsection. The Judicial Conference is 
directed to prescribe by rule the system by which complaints 
will be referred among judicial circuits, as well as the United 
States Court of Federal Claims, the Court of International 
Trade, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The 
Judicial Conference shall establish and submit to Congress the 
system of referral within 180 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act.

              title iv--judicial financial administration

Sec. 401. Increase in civil action filing fee

    In September 1992, the Judicial Conference, noting that 
civil filing fees had been increased from $15 to $60 in 1978 
and from $60 to $120 in 1986, recommended that 28 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1914(a) be amended to increase the civil filing fee from 
$120 to $150.
    This section increases the filing fee for civil actions in 
the district courts under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1914 from $120 to 
$150. This modest adjustment affects only the initial ``user 
fee'' for all litigants not proceeding in forma pauperis under 
28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915. Although the initial filing fee of some 
state courts of general jurisdiction may be less, many states 
have add-on fees. For example, in twenty-six states, courts 
charge a jury demand fee which can be as high as $300, 
according to the National Center for State Courts. Also, actual 
reimbursement fees for jury trials ordered in certain judgments 
run much higher, depending upon the length of trial. Other 
states impose a fee for filing an answer, requesting a trial or 
filing a motion.
    Additionally, this section amends 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1931 to 
have the first $90 (rather than $60) of each fee be deposited 
into the special judiciary fund in the Treasury to be available 
to offset funds appropriated for the operation and maintenance 
of the courts. According to the Judicial Conference, as a 
result, the judiciary would receive about $6.6 million 
annually, thereby reducing the need for direct appropriations.
    The section provides for a 60 day delay in the effective 
date in the proposed increase to the civil filing fee. This 
delay would allow clerks of court to implement the filing fee 
increase.

Sec. 402. Interpreter performance examination fees

    Since the enactment in 1978 of the Court Interpreters Act, 
28 U.S.C. Sec. 1827, the Administrative Office has been 
responsible for the development and administration of 
interpreter certification examinations. From 1985 to the 
present, the Administrative Office has contracted with the 
University of Arizona to perform this function. Under this 
contract, the contractor may charge a fee to offset costs of 
developing and administering the exam. For the Spanish 
certification exam, the fees collected by the University defray 
a significant portion of the cost.
    While this contracting approach has been followed for 
almost a decade, a review of the program has raised some 
concerns about the validity of contract language permitting the 
contractor to collect fees and budget funds without clear 
statutory authorization. Accordingly, this section amends 28 
U.S.C. Sec. 1827 to expressly authorize the Director of the 
Administrative Office to prescribe fees for examinations given 
for the purpose of certifying qualified interpreters, and to 
permit the contractor to collect and retain some or all of the 
fees as direct payment for contract services. The section also 
validates such provisions in current and past contracts. Any 
funds collected after this section takes effect that are not 
retained by a contractor are to be deposited into the 
offsetting fund established under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1931.

Sec. 403. Judicial panel on multidistrict litigation

    Several provisions of title 28, United States Code, 
authorize the Judicial Conference to establish miscellaneous 
fee schedules for the federal, appellate, district, claims and 
bankruptcy courts. The Judiciary's 1991 appropriations act 
provided permanent authority for fees charged for electronic 
public access to these courts' databases to be deposited into 
the Judiciary Automation Fund, which pays the costs of 
providing those services. Currently, the Judicial Panel on 
Multidistrict Litigation is included in these statutes. The 
purpose of this section is to establish conformity in the 
federal judiciary by authorizing the Judicial Conference to 
establish a Miscellaneous Fee Schedule for the Panel and by 
authorizing the deposit of electronic public access fees 
collected by the Panel into the Judiciary Automation Fund.

Sec. 404. Disposition of fees

    This section allows the judiciary to retain the revenue 
from increases above current levels in (1) attorney admission 
fees, (2) duplicate admission certificates, and (3) 
certificates of good standing. It is anticipated that if such 
legislation were enacted, the Judicial Conference would raise 
the attorney admission fee from $20 to $50, and raise fees for 
duplicate judiciary certificates and certificates of good 
standing from $5 to $15. This would provide about $2 million 
annually for the judiciary.
    This section also allows the judiciary to retain additional 
revenues derived from increases in fees for filing an adversary 
complaint in bankruptcy cases. Item 6 of the Bankruptcy Court 
Miscellaneous Fee Schedule, which was adopted by the Judicial 
Conference pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1930, provides that the 
fee charged for filing a complaint be the same amount as the 
filing fee prescribed in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1914(a) for instituting 
any civil action other than a writ of habeas corpus.
    Additionally, this section provides that the additional $30 
from each bankruptcy complaint filing is to be deposited into 
the special judiciary fund in the Treasury. These revenues 
would be available to offset funds appropriated for the 
operation and maintenance of the courts.

        TITLE V--FEDERAL COURTS STUDY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

Sec. 501. Qualification of chief judge of court of international trade

    Under existing 28 U.S.C. Sec. 251(b), the President 
designates one of the nine judges of the court, who is less 
than 70 years old, to serve as chief judge. The chief judge so 
designated continues to serve as chief judge until the judge 
reaches the age of seventy and another judge is designated as 
chief judge by the President.
    The method for selecting the chief judges of the other 
Article III courts provides that the chief judge of the court 
shall be the judge in regular service who is senior in 
commission of those judges who (a) is sixty-four years of age 
or under; (b) has served as a judge of the court for at least 
one year; and (c) has not previously served as chief judge.
    This method of selection was reviewed by the Federal Courts 
Study Committee, which recommended that this method not be 
changed. In particular, the Committee Report stated:

          The modified seniority method of chief judge 
        selection established in 1982 (see 28 U.S.C. 
        Sec. Sec. 45 & 136) is not faultless, but it operates 
        well in practice and is preferable to any other method. 
        The statutorily specified term for chief judges is a 
        definite improvement over the previous pattern of very 
        short or very long periods of service.

    This section changes the system for selecting the chief 
judge of the Court of International Trade to conform with the 
modified seniority system applicable to every other Article III 
court. This significantly improves the political selection of a 
chief judge by the President and has the support of the 
Judicial Conference of the United States.

                   title vi--places of holding court

Sec. 601. Place of holding court in the Southern District of New York

    In March 1993, the Judicial Conference approved a proposal 
to amend 28 U.S.C. Sec. 112(b) to establish the Middletown-
Wallkill area of Orange County, New York (west of Hudson) as a 
place of holding court in the Southern District of New York. 
This section implements that proposal.

Sec. 602. Place of holding court in the Eastern District of Texas

    This amendment would implement the March 1991 Judicial 
Conference proposal to designate Plano, Texas as a place of 
holding court in the Eastern District of Texas. In addition, 
the provision clarifies that court for the Eastern District of 
Texas and the Western District of Arkansas may be held anywhere 
in the Federal Courthouse which sits astride the Texas-Arkansas 
state line.

                        title vii--miscellaneous

Sec. 701. Participation in judicial governance activities by district, 
        senior, and magistrate judges

    Currently, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 331 provides, in relevant part, 
that ``[t]he district judge to be summoned [to the Judicial 
Conference] from each judicial circuit shall be chosen by the 
circuit and district judges of the circuit at the annual 
judicial conference of the circuit held pursuant to section 333 
of this title * * * .'' In 1990, 28 U.S.C. Sec. 333 was amended 
to permit the circuit judicial conferences to be held 
biennially instead of annually. This raised the question of 
whether the circuit and district judges could elect their 
district court representative to the Judicial Conference 
without holding an annual meeting. The General Counsel's office 
of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts 
concluded that it was reasonable to assume the judges could 
make this decision without a formal meeting, but recommended a 
technical amendment. Accordingly, this section amends 28 U.S.C. 
Sec. 331 to authorize each judicial conference to choose a 
representative in accordance with rules adopted by the judicial 
conference of the circuit.

Sec. 702. The Director and Deputy Director of the Administrative Office 
        as officers of the United States

    The Judicial Improvements Act of 1990 (Pub. L. No. 101-650) 
changed the authority for appointment of the Director and 
Deputy Director of the Administrative Office from the Supreme 
Court to the Chief Justice (after consulting with the Judicial 
Conference). In so doing, it appears Congress inadvertently 
eliminated these two positions from the definition of 
``officer'' of the United States under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2104, 
which defines an ``officer of the United States'' for purposes 
of title 5, United States Code. While qualification of these 
positions under the definition of ``employee'' of the United 
States prevents inadvertent disqualification for certain 
benefits, the positions should be clearly included under the 
term ``officer''.
    In the past, the Director and Deputy Director have 
qualified as ``officers'' under the title 5 definition because 
they were (1) appointed by a court of the United States, (2) 
engaged in the performance of a federal function under 
authority of law, and (3) were subject to the supervision of 
the Judicial Conference while engaged in the performance of the 
duties of office. Appointment by the Chief Justice will not 
allow a Director or Deputy Director literally to meet the 
definition of ``officer''. Accordingly, the General Counsel of 
the Administrative Office suggested legislation to make it 
clear that the Director and Deputy Director of the 
Administrative Office are ``officers'' of the United States. 
This section accomplishes that purpose by adding a new sentence 
to the end of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 601 to the effect that ``[t]he 
Director and Deputy Director shall be deemed to be `officers' 
for the purposes of title 5, United States Code.''

Sec. 703. Removal of action from State court

    This section conforms 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1446(c)(1) to the 
language in the rest of the section by substituting ``defendant 
or defendants'' for ``petitioner''.

Sec. 704. Federal Judicial Center employee retirement provisions

    This section clarifies 28 U.S.C. Sec. 627(b) to remove any 
doubt that eligible Federal Judicial Center staff, including 
the Deputy Director, are covered by the Federal Employees 
Retirement System (FERS) under 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8401 et seq.

Sec. 705. Abolition of the Special Court, Regional Rail Reauthorization 
        Act of 1973.

    Section 705 abolishes the Special Court that was 
established in the early 1970's to oversee the reorganization 
of insolvent railroads. That court's caseload has declined to 
less than 10 cases, none of which involve significant activity. 
The section transfers the Special Court's jurisdiction over 
those cases and any future rail reorganization proceedings to 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where the 
court's records and a majority of its judges are currently 
located, and makes other changes incidental to the court's 
abolition. As there is already an established, uniform body of 
law regarding these matters, it is easier to maintain that 
unified body of law within one court. Further, the precedential 
value of the Special Court will be retained and the 
jurisprudence of the Special Court will be adopted by the 
District Court for the District of Columbia for the purpose of 
deciding these cases.
    More specifically, subsection (a) amends 45 U.S.C. Sec. 719 
to provide that the Special Court is abolished after a 90-day 
transition period. At the end of the transition period, the 
District Court for the District of Columbia assumes 
responsibility for the Special Court's remaining docket and 
acquires the latter's exclusive, nationwide jurisdiction under 
the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, the Northeast 
Rail Service Act of 1981, the Conrail Privatization Act, and 
related statutes. Subsection (a) also deems all statutory or 
regulatory references to the Special Court to refer to the 
District Court for the District of Columbia for purposes of any 
proceedings after the Special Court is abolished. Subsection 
(b) provides that appeals in rail reorganization cases decided 
by the District Court for the District of Columbia shall lie to 
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
    Subsection (c) makes necessary conforming amendments. 
Subsection (d) provides that cases pending at the time of the 
Special Court's abolition will be assigned to the District 
Court for the District of Columbia as if they had been filed 
originally in that court. Subsection (e) provides that the 
amendments concerning appellate review and the conforming 
amendments become effective 90 days after enactment. The 
appellate review amendments, however, do not apply to any final 
order or judgment entered by the Special Court, which is a 
three-judge court, for which a petition for writ of certiorari 
has already been filed or the time for filing such petition has 
not expired.
    By way of background, in the early 1970's, Congress was 
confronted with a rail transportation crisis when the eight 
major railroads in the Northeast and Midwest filed for 
bankruptcy relief and faced likely dissolution. It responded 
with emergency legislation to reorganize and streamline the 
insolvent railroads and, as part of that scheme, established a 
``Special Court'' of three federal judges, drawn from other 
courts, to oversee the reorganization by approving a new rail 
system plan, reviewing and ordering the requisite property 
conveyances, determining appropriate compensation, and making 
other necessary findings and determinations. During the 1980's, 
the court was expanded to six judges (sitting in three-judge 
panels), and its jurisdiction was extended to include oversight 
of the subsequent reorganization of northeast rail service and 
privatization of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail).
    With the Special Court's unique mission essentially 
completed, it is now appropriate to abolish that court and send 
any remaining proceedings to a regular district court. This 
section produces budgetary and administrative economies and, 
according to the Judicial Conference, will result in an annual 
cost savings of approximately $175,000. Elimination of a 
special tribunal with narrow jurisdiction also accords with the 
view, expressed in Recommendations 16 and 24 of the Judicial 
Conference's Long Range Plan for the Federal Courts, that 
federal litigation ordinarily should proceed in the regular 
trial and appellate courts.

Sec. 706. Exception of residency requirement for district judges 
        appointed to the Southern District and Eastern District of New 
        York

    This section amends 28 U.S.C. Sec. 134(b) to allow judges 
from the Southern District of New York (which includes the 
Burroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx and nine northern suburban 
counties) to reside within 20 miles of the district to which 
they were appointed.
    Title 28 U.S.C. Sec. 134(b) requires district court judges 
to reside in the district to which they were appointed. The 
underlying policy for this statute is that judges should reside 
in the community in which they administer the law. Because of 
its unique geographic status, judges appointed to the District 
of Columbia District are already exempt from this requirement.
    As with judges, and for similar policy reasons, United 
States Attorneys are required to reside in the district to 
which they are appointed. However, there are three exceptions 
to this requirement: the District of Columbia; the Eastern 
District of New York; and the Southern District of New York. In 
these three exceptions, the United States Attorneys may reside 
within 20 miles of the district. This section applies the same 
residency requirements presently in effect for United States 
Attorneys in the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York to 
federal district judges in those districts.
    This exemption applies a common sense approach to the 
residency requirement. New York is the only city in the United 
States that is divided between two federal judicial districts. 
Judges, while still being required to live in the community in 
which they administer the law, would not be prohibited from 
residing in a particular section of the city because of this 
jurisdictional anomaly.

Sec. 707. Civil justice expense and delay reduction plans

    In the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990, Congress directed 
that district courts ``shall consider and may include'' in 
their civil justice expense and delay reduction plans ``(6) 
authorization to refer appropriate cases to alternative dispute 
resolution programs that (A) have been designated for use in a 
district court; or (B) the court may make available, including 
mediation, minitrial, and summary jury trial.'' (28 USC 
Sec. 473(a)(6)) The omission of reference to arbitration 
programs has left a void in the implementation of the Civil 
Justice Reform Act and reduced its utility as a vehicle to 
further the installation of ADR programs in the federal courts.
    This section would add arbitration to (28 USC Sec. 473(a) 
(6)) to make it clear that courts are free to adopt an 
arbitration program if they think it is appropriate.
    Section 707 also amends sections 104(d) and 105(c) of the 
Civil Justice Reform Act (CJRA) of 1990 to extend to June 30, 
1997, the date by which the Judicial Conference is required to 
submit reports on the CJRA demonstration program and the CJRA 
pilot program.
    Section 105 of the CJRA requires the Judicial Conference to 
transmit to Congress a final report containing recommendations 
on the implementation of cost and delay reduction programs in 
the federal district courts. These recommendations are to be 
based on the results of the independent assessment of the CJRA 
pilot and comparison courts presently being conducted by the 
RAND Corporation.
    Under the current statute, both the RAND report and the 
Judicial Conference report are to be transmitted to Congress no 
later than December 31, 1996. The RAND Corporation plans to 
submit a draft of its report to the Judicial Conference 
Committee on Court Administration and Case Management on June 
30, 1996, and then the final report to the Judicial Conference 
in September 1996. Under this schedule, the Judicial Conference 
and its committees will have only three months thereafter to 
analyze the RAND report, which is expected to be 400 to 600 
pages in length, and develop appropriate recommendations for 
its report to Congress.
    Due to the importance of the CJRA for the entire judiciary 
and the effort and funds already expended on the study, 
sufficient time should be allotted to develop a thorough, 
reasoned, and complete report to Congress. The Conference would 
greatly benefit from receiving the views of individual judges, 
Judicial Conference committees, and private sector groups, 
including the organized bar, regarding the RAND report. It 
would be very difficult to obtain and consider all these 
disparate opinions under the current three-month timeline. 
Therefore, this section extends by six months, to June 30, 
1997, the date by which the Judicial Conference's CJRA report 
is to be transmitted to Congress.
    Section 104 of the CJRA imposes the additional requirement 
that the Judicial Conference submit a separate report on the 
district courts that participated in the Act's demonstration 
program. For the sake of consistency, section 104 of the CJRA 
is amended to state that this report is also due on June 30, 
1997.

Sec. 708. Venue in the territorial courts

    Section 708 would correct an anomaly in existing law 
relating to the venue transfer provisions contained in 28 
U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1404 and 1406. Under current law, district 
courts may transfer cases to other district courts where venue 
is proper either if the transferee court is more convenient (28 
U.S.C. Sec. 1404) or if venue is improper in the transferor 
court (28 U.S.C. Sec. 1406). As currently written, these 
transfer provisions specifically apply to the District Court 
for the District of the Canal Zone (which no longer exists), 
but not to the other territorial courts under the jurisdiction 
of the United States. A recent unpublished decision of the 
Third Circuit asked us to address this anomaly. Abdullah v. AMR 
Corp., No. 95-7025 (3d Cir. May 15, 1995). Although the 
territorial courts (i.e. the District Courts of the Virgin 
Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands) are not like 
U.S. District Courts in all respects, they should have the 
benefit of these transfer mechanisms whenever they are needed. 
Enacting Sec. 708 will improve the administration of justice by 
improving the courts' ability to send cases to the appropriate 
district. Section 708 would make it clear that the territorial 
courts may use the venue transfer provisions, and it would also 
eliminate the anachronistic reference to the Canal Zone court.

  (a) * * *
  (b) Any person charged with a misdemeanor, other than a petty 
offense that is a class B misdemeanor charging a motor vehicle 
offense, a class C misdemeanor, or an infraction, may elect, 
however, to be tried before a [judge of the district court] 
district judge for the district in which the offense was 
committed. The magistrate judge shall carefully explain to the 
defendant that he has a right to trial, judgment, and 
sentencing by a [judge of the district court] district judge 
and that he may have a right to trial by jury before a district 
judge or magistrate judge. [The magistrate shall not proceed to 
try the case unless the defendant, after such explanation, 
files a written consent to be tried before the magistrate that 
specifically waives trial, judgment, and sentencing by a judge 
of the district court.] The magistrate judge may not proceed to 
try the case unless the defendant, after such explanation, 
expressly consents to be tried before the magistrate judge and 
expressly and specifically waives trial, judgment, and 
sentencing by a district judge. Any such consent and waiver 
shall be made in writing or orally on the record.
          * * * * * * *
  (g) [The magistrate may, in a Class B or C misdemeanor case, 
or infraction case, involving a juvenile in which consent to 
trial before a magistrate has been filed under subsection (b) 
of this section, exercise all powers granted to the district 
court under chapter 403 of this title.] The magistrate judge 
may, in a petty offense case involving a juvenile, that is a 
class B misdemeanor charging a motor vehicle offense, a class C 
misdemeanor, or an infraction, exercise all powers granted to 
the district court under chapter 403 of this title. The 
magistrate judge may, in any other class B or C misdemeanor 
case involving a juvenile in which consent to trial before a 
magistrate judge has been filed under subsection (b), exercise 
all powers granted to the district court under chapter 403 of 
this title. For purposes of this subsection, proceedings under 
chapter 403 of this title may be instituted against a juvenile 
by a violation notice or complaint, except that no such case 
may proceed unless the certification referred to in section 
5032 of this title has been filed in open court at the 
arraignment. No term of imprisonment shall be imposed by the 
magistrate in any such case.

as the chief judge.
  (B) In any case under subparagraph (A) in which there is no

Sec. 372. Retirement for disability; substitute judge on failure to 
                    retire; judicial discipline

  (a) * * *
          * * * * * * *
  (c)(1)(A) Any person alleging that a circuit, district, or 
bankruptcy judge, or a magistrate, has engaged in conduct 
prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of 
the business of the courts, or alleging that such a judge or 
magistrate is unable to discharge all the duties of office by 
reason of mental or physical disability, may file with the 
clerk of the court of appeals for the circuit a written 
complaint containing a brief statement of the facts 
constituting such conduct. In the interests of the effective 
and expeditious administration of the business of the courts 
and on the basis of information available to the chief judge of 
the circuit, the chief judge may, by written order stating 
reasons therefor, identify a complaint for purposes of this 
subsection and thereby dispense with filing of a written 
complaint. In the case of a complaint so identified, the chief 
judge shall notify the clerk of the court of appeals of the 
complaint, together with a brief statement of the facts 
underlying the complaint.
  (B) Complaints filed under subparagraph (A) in one judicial 
circuit shall be referred to another judicial circuit for 
proceedings under this subsection, in accordance with a system 
established by rule by the Judicial Conference, which 
prescribes the circuits to which the complaints will be 
referred. The Judicial Conference shall establish and submit to 
the Congress the system described in the preceding sentence not 
later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
subparagraph.
  (2) [Upon receipt of a complaint filed under paragraph (1) of 
this subsection, the clerk shall promptly transmit such 
complaint to the chief judge of the circuit, or, if the conduct 
complained of is that of the chief judge, to that circuit judge 
in regular active service next senior in date of commission 
(hereafter, for purposes of this subsection only, included in 
the term ``chief judge'').] Upon receipt of a complaint filed 
or notice of a complaint identified under paragraph (1) of this 
subsection, the clerk shall promptly transmit such complaint or 
(in the case of a complaint identified under paragraph (1)) the 
statement of facts underlying the complaint to the chief judge 
of the circuit assigned to conduct proceedings on the complaint 
in accordance with the system established under paragraph 
(1)(B) (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the ``chief 
judge''). The clerk shall simultaneously transmit a copy of the 
complaint or statement of facts underlying the complaint (as 
the case may be) to the judge or magistrate whose conduct is 
the subject of the complaint .
          * * * * * * *
  (4) If the chief judge does not enter an order under 
paragraph (3) of this subsection, such judge shall promptly--
          (A) appoint himself and equal numbers of circuit and 
        district judges of the circuit (to which the complaint 
        or statement of facts underlying the complaint is 
        referred) to a special committee to investigate the 
        facts and allegations contained in the complaint;
          * * * * * * *
  (5) Each committee appointed under paragraph (4) of this 
subsection shall conduct an investigation as extensive as it 
considers necessary, and shall expeditiously file a 
comprehensive written report thereon with the judicial council 
of the circuit to which the complaint or statement of facts 
underlying the complaint is referred. Such report shall present 
both the findings of the investigation and the committee's 
recommendations for necessary and appropriate action by the 
judicial council of [the] that circuit.
          * * * * * * *
  (15) Each written order to implement any action under 
paragraph (6)(B) of this subsection, which is issued by a 
judicial council, the Judicial Conference, or the standing 
committee established under section 331 of this title, shall be 
made available to the public through the appropriate clerk's 
office of the court of appeals for the circuit in which the 
complaint was filed or identified under paragraph (1). Unless 
contrary to the interests of justice, each such order issued 
under this paragraph shall be accompanied by written reasons 
therefor.
          * * * * * * *
  [(18) The United States Court of Federal Claims, the Court of 
International Trade, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit shall each prescribe rules, consistent with the 
foregoing provisions of this subsection, establishing 
procedures for the filing of complaints with respect to the 
conduct of any judge of such court and for the investigation 
and resolution of such complaints. In investigating and taking 
action with respect to any such complaint, each such court 
shall have the powers granted to a judicial council under this 
subsection.]
  (18) The Judicial Conference shall prescribe rules, 
consistent with the preceding provisions of this subsection--
          (A) establishing procedures for the filing of 
        complaints with respect to the conduct of any judge of 
        the United States Court of Federal Claims, the Court of 
        International Trade, or the Court of Appeals for the 
        Federal Circuit, and for the investigation and 
        resolution of such complaints; and
          (B) establishing a system for referring complaints 
        filed with respect to the conduct of a judge of any 
        such court to any of the first eleven judicial circuits 
        or to another court for investigation and resolution.
The Judicial Conference shall establish and submit to the 
Congress the system described in subparagraph (B) not later 
than 180 days after the date of the enactment of the Federal

meaning of subchapter III of chapter 83 (relating to civil 
service retirement), chapter 84 (relating to the Federal 
Employees' Retirement System), chapter 87 (relating to Federal

          (3) the power to conduct trials under section 3401, 
        title 18, United States Code, in conformity with and 
        subject to the limitations of that section[, and];
          [(4) the power to enter a sentence for a misdemeanor 
        or infraction with the consent of the parties.]
          (4) the power to enter a sentence for a petty offense 
        that is a class B misdemeanor charging a motor vehicle 
        offense, a class C misdemeanor, or an infraction; and
          (5) the power to enter a sentence for a class A 
        misdemeanor, or a class B or C misdemeanor not covered 
        by paragraph (4), in a case in which the parties have 
        consented.

  (c) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary--
          (1) * * *
          * * * * * * *
          (3) Upon entry of judgment in any case referred under 
        paragraph (1) of this subsection, an aggrieved party 
        may appeal directly to the appropriate United States 
        court of appeals from the judgment of the magistrate in 
        the same manner as an appeal from any other judgment of 
        a district court. [In this circumstance, the] The 
        consent of the parties allows a magistrate designated 
        to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of 
        this subsection to direct the entry of a judgment of 
        the district court in accordance with the Federal Rules 
        of Civil Procedure. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 
        construed as a limitation of any party's right to seek 
        review by the Supreme Court of the United States.
          [(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (3) 
        of this subsection, at the time of reference to a 
        magistrate, the parties may further consent to appeal 
        on the record to a judge of the district court in the 
        same manner as on an appeal from a judgment of the 
        district court to a court of appeals. Wherever possible 
        the local rules of the district court and the rules 
        promulgated by the conference shall endeavor to make 
        such appeal inexpensive. The district court may affirm, 
        reverse, modify, or remand the magistrate's judgment.
          [(5) Cases in the district courts under paragraph (4) 
        of this subsection may be reviewed by the appropriate 
        United States court of appeals upon petition for leave 
        to appeal by a party stating specific objections to the 
        judgment. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed 
        to be a limitation on any party's right to seek review 
        by the Supreme Court of the United States.]
          [(6)] (4) The court may, for good cause shown on its 
        own motion, or under extraordinary circumstances shown 
        by any party, vacate a reference of a civil matter to a 
        magistrate under this subsection.
          [(7)] (5) The magistrate shall, subject to guidelines 
        of the Judicial Conference, determine whether the 
        record taken pursuant to this section shall be taken by 
        electronic sound recording, by a court reporter, or by 
        other means.
          (d) The practice and procedure for the trial of cases 
        before officers serving under this chapter[, and for 
        the taking and hearing of appeals to the district 
        courts,] shall conform to rules promulgated by the 
        Supreme Court pursuant to section 2072 of this title.
          * * * * * * *
          (f) In an emergency and upon the concurrence of the 
        chief judges of the districts involved, a United States 
        magistrate may be temporarily assigned to perform any 
        of the duties specified in subsection [(a) or (b)] (a), 
        (b), or (c) of this section in a judicial district 
        other than the judicial district for which he has been 
        appointed. No magistrate shall perform any of such 
        duties in a district to which he has been temporarily 
        assigned until an order has been issued by the chief 
        judge of such district specifying (1) the emergency by 
        reason of which he has been transferred, (2) the 
        duration of his assignment, and (3) the duties which he 
        is authorized to perform. A magistrate so assigned 
        shall not be entitled to additional compensation but 
        shall be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses 
        incurred in the performance of his duties in accordance 
        with section 635.

  Sec. 303. (a) The Judicial Conference shall hereafter 
prescribe reasonable fees, pursuant to sections 1913, 1914,

                            judicial review

  Sec. 209. (a) * * *
  (b) Special Court.--(1) Within 30 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Association shall make application 
to the judicial panel on multi-district litigation authorized 
by section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, for the 
consolidation in a single, three-judge district court of the 
United States of all judicial proceedings with respect to the 
final system plan. Within 30 days after such application is 
received, the panel shall make the consolidation in a district 
court (cited herein as the ``special court'') which the panel 
determines to be convenient to the parties and the one most 
likely to be able to conduct any proceedings under this section 
with the least delay and the greatest possible fairness and 
ability. Such proceedings shall be conducted by the special 
court which shall be composed of three Federal judges who shall 
be selected by the panel, except that none of the judges 
selected may be a judge assigned to a proceeding involving any 
railroad in reorganization in the region under section 77 of 
the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. 205). The special court is 
authorized to exercise the powers of a district judge in any 
judicial district with respect to such proceedings and such 
powers shall include those of a reorganization court. The 
special court shall have the power to order the conveyance of 
rail properties of railroads leased, operated, or controlled by 
a railroad in reorganization in the region. The special court 
may issue rules for the conduct of any proceedings under this 
section and under section 305 of this Act, including rules with 
respect to the time within which motions may be filed, and with 
respect to appropriate representation of interests not 
otherwise represented (including the Secretary with respect to 
a petition by the Association in the case of a proposal 
developed by the Secretary, under such section 305). No 
determination by the panel under this subsection may be 
reviewed in any court.
  (2) The special court referred to in paragraph (1) of this 
subsection is abolished effective 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996. On 
such effective date, all jurisdiction and other functions of 
the special court shall be assumed by the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia. With respect to 
any proceedings that arise or continue after the date on which 
the special court is abolished, the references in the following 
provisions to the special court established under this 
subsection shall be deemed to refer to the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia:
