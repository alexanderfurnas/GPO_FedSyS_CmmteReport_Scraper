       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and Senate at the 
conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3603) making 
appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the 
fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes, 
submit the following joint statement to the House and Senate in 
explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon the 
managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report.

                        congressional directives

      The conferees agree that executive branch wishes cannot 
substitute for Congress' own statements as to the best evidence 
of congressional intentions--that is, the official reports of 
the Congress. The conferees further point out that funds in 
this Act must be used for the purposes for which appropriated, 
as required by section 1301 of title 31 of the United States 
Code, which provides: ``Appropriations shall be applied only to 
the objects for which the appropriations were made except as 
otherwise provided by law.''
      Report language included by the House which is not 
changed by the report of the Senate, and Senate report language 
which is not changed by the conference are approved by the 
committee of conference. The statement of the managers, while 
repeating some report language for emphasis, does not intend to 
negate the language referred to above unless expressly provided 
herein.

                     TITLE I--AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS

                 Production, Processing, and Marketing

                        office of the secretary

      Amendment No. 1: Deletes House language limiting the 
detail or assignment of personnel to any Under Secretary or 
Assistant Secretary office to not more than 30 days. The Senate 
bill and the conference agreement address this issue in 
Amendment No. 125. The conference agreement also removes a 
restriction on the amount of funding for rural housing that may 
be made available from the Fund for Rural America.

        agriculture buildings and facilities and rental payments

      Amendment No. 2: Provides $23,505,000 for repairs, 
renovations, and construction of USDA buildings and facilities 
instead of $5,000,000 as proposed by the House and $23,505,400 
as proposed by the Senate.
      Amendment No. 3: Appropriates $144,053,000 for 
Agriculture Buildings and Facilities and Rental Payments 
instead of $125,548,000 as proposed by the House and 
$144,053,400 as proposed by the Senate.

                      departmental administration

      Amendment No. 4: Appropriates $30,529,000 for 
Departmental Administration as proposed by the Senate instead 
of $28,304,000 as proposed by the House.
      Amendment No. 5: Deletes Senate language earmarking not 
less than $11,774,000 of the amount appropriated for 
Departmental Administration for civil rights enforcement. The 
conferees expect that not less than $11,774,000 of the amount 
appropriated will be directed to civil rights enforcement.

     OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS

      Amendment No. 6: Appropriates $3,668,000 for the Office 
of the Assistant Secretary for Congressional Relations as 
proposed by the Senate instead of $3,728,000 as proposed by the 
House.

                       ECONOMIC RESEARCH SERVICE

      Amendment No. 7: Appropriates $53,109,000 for the 
Economic Research Service as proposed by the Senate instead of 
$54,176,000 as proposed by the House.

                NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS SERVICE

      Amendment No. 8: Appropriates $100,221,000 for the 
National Agricultural Statistics Service as proposed by the 
House instead of $98,121,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                     AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE

      Amendment No. 9: Appropriates $716,826,000 for the 
Agricultural Research Service instead of $702,831,000 as 
proposed by the House and $722,839,600 as proposed by the 
Senate.

      Potato research.--The conferees expect the Department to 
ensure that funds provided to CSREES for potato research are 
utilized for varietal development/testing. Further, these funds 
are to be awarded competitively after review by the USDA Potato 
Industry Working Group.
      Corn genome mapping.--The conference agreement provides 
no specific earmark for corn genome mapping but the conferees 
urge the Department to provide increased attention to this 
effort and develop a long-term approach for corn genome 
mapping.

                        Buildings and Facilities

      Amendment No. 26: Appropriates $61,591,000 for 
Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, 
Buildings and Facilities instead of $30,449,000 as proposed by 
the House and $55,668,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      As stated in the fiscal year 1996 conference report, the 
conferees, within available resources, would provide for 
completion of as many university facilities as possible during 
fiscal year 1997. Fourteen facilities are completed by this 
appropriation. The conferees expect any unfinished university 
project to obtain additional funding from other than Federal 
sources. The Department should not release additional funds to 
incomplete projects until all funding for completion is in 
place. The conferees expect universities to obtain funding 
within three years. It is anticipated that all unused funds 
would be rescinded. The conferees also agree with the 
reprogramming of funds as proposed by the Senate.
      The following table reflects the conference agreement:

operation. The conferees expect the Department to reconsider 
this decision.

to $1,500,000 to establish a National Farm Identification Pilot 
Program for dairy cows to be conducted jointly by the Food 
Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and the Animal and Plant 
Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The conferees expect such a 
pilot program to be established with not to exceed $1,500,000 
of the funds appropriated to the FSIS account.
      The conferees have provided the full budget request for 
FSIS and expect the agency to manage its resources in such a 
way as to eliminate the need for supplemental funding.

      Amendment No. 56: Provides a loan level of $34,653,000 
for a pilot program for boll weevil eradication instead of 
$15,384,000 as proposed by the Senate. The conferees believe 
this program has merit and provides potential to reduce long-
term costs associated with the boll weevil eradication efforts. 
The conference agreement provides a small amount of startup 
funding and will evaluate the effectiveness of the loan program 
during fiscal year 1997. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.

assistance in Franklin County, Mississippi; $125,000 for Golden

funds earmarked for this purpose in previous appropriations.
      The conferees expect progress to continue to complete the 
Upper Trinity River Basin cooperative study from funds 
available in the Watershed Surveys and Planning account.
      The conference agreement includes $200,000 under 
Conservation Operations, the same as the fiscal year 1996

incentives program. The conferees direct that $2,800,000 of 
this program, the same as the fiscal year 1996 amount, be 
provided for financial assistance of the Multi-year Rural 
Recycling and Water Resources Protection Initiative in the 
Mississippi Delta.
      The conferees agree that funds provided for Conservation 
Operations are not to supplant use of Commodity Credit 
Corporation funds for the full implementation of the Wetlands 
Reserve Program and the Conservation Reserve Program. Both the 
Wetlands Reserve Program and the Conservation Reserve Program 
were previously funded through appropriated accounts, but the 
Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act provides that 
these programs now be administered through funds provided 
directly from the Commodity Credit Corporation.
      Amendment No. 61: Deletes Senate language earmarking up 
to $250,000 for the National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation. The House bill contained no similar provision.

to venture projects which already receive support from the

enrollments as proposed by the Senate and limits the number of

agricultural commodity or is not devoted to a conserving use, 
unless it is determined that the lack of agricultural 
production or the lack of a conserving use is a consequence of 
drought, flood, or other natural disaster. It is not intended

procedures for implementing the Agricultural Market Transition

which results in additional reporting or certification

domestic workers after enactment of this Act.
