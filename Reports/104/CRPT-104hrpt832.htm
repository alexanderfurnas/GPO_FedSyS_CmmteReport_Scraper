SEC. 816. STUDY ON THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION.

    (a) Study.--The Director of Central Intelligence shall, in 
consultation with the Deputy Secretary of Defense, conduct a 
study on the future of intelligence collection. The study shall 
address whether collection resources can be managed in a more 
consolidated, integrated manner. The study is not limited to, 
but should include, specific examination of the following:
            (1) Establishing within the Intelligence Community 
        a single agency with responsibility for--
                    (A) the clandestine collection of 
                intelligence through human sources and other 
                clandestine techniques;
                    (B) covert action; and
                    (C) representing the Director of Central 
                Intelligence in liaison with foreign 
                intelligence and security services.
            (2) Establishing a single agency for the conduct of 
        technical intelligence collection activities, 
        including--
                    (A) signals intelligence (SIGINT), imagery 
                intelligence (IMINT), and measurement and 
                signatures intelligence (MASINT);
                    (B) first-phase (or initial) exploitation 
                of the results of such collection;
                    (C) dissemination of such collection in a 
                timely manner;
                    (D) development of processing and 
                exploitation technologies to support these 
                functions; and
                    (E) serving as the sole agent within the 
                Intelligence Community for--
                            (i) the specification of technical 
                        requirements for such reconnaissance 
                        systems as may be needed to meet the 
                        signals intelligence, imagery 
                        intelligence, and measurement and 
                        signatures intelligence collection 
                        requirements of the Intelligence 
                        Community; and
                            (ii) the operation and final 
                        disposition of such systems.
            (3) Establishing a single agency--
                    (A) to serve as the sole agent within the 
                Intelligence Community for the conduct of 
                research, development, test, and evaluation, 
                for procurement, and for launch of satellite 
                reconnaissance systems that may be required to 
                satisfy the intelligence collection 
                requirements of the Intelligence Community; and
                    (B) to serve as the primary agent within 
                the Intelligence Community for the conduct of 
                research, development, test, evaluation and for 
                procurement of reconnaissance, surveillance, 
                and sensor systems, including airborne and 
                maritime reconnaissance capabilities within the 
                National Foreign Intelligence Program and the 
                Joint Military Intelligence Program.
    (b) Criteria.--The study under subsection (a) shall--
            (1) take into account current and future 
        technological capabilities and intelligence 
        requirements;
            (2) take into account the costs and benefits 
        associated with establishing each of the agencies 
        described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection 
        (a) as well as the costs and benefits of maintaining 
        the current system of distinct ``collection 
        stovepipes''; and
            (3) examine establishing each of the agencies 
        described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection 
        (a) both on their individual merits and also with a 
        view toward having such agencies co-exist as an entire 
        new organizational structure.
    (c) Report.--Not later than April 15, 1997, the Director of 
Central Intelligence shall submit a report on the study to the 
following:
            (1) The President.
            (2) The Secretary of Defense
            (3) The Select Committee on Intelligence and the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the Senate.
            (4) The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
        and the Committee on National Security of the House of 
        Representatives.

SEC. 817. INTELLIGENCE RESERVE CORPS.

    (a) Report on Corps.--Not later than four months after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of Central 
Intelligence shall submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a report on the Surge Augmentation Program to provide 
for an Intelligence Reserve Corps to serve as a surge or 
augmentation resource for the Intelligence Community. The 
report shall include such recommendations for legislation as 
the Director considers appropriate.
    (b) Appropriate Committees Defined.--In this section, the 
term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means the 
following:
            (1) The Committee on Governmental Affairs and the 
        Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.
            (2) The Committee on Government Reform and 
        Oversight and the Permanent Select Committee on 
        Intelligence of the House of Representatives.

                      TITLE IX--FINANCIAL MATTERS

                                Managers on the Part of the Senate.
       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on 
the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3259) to 
authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1997 for intelligence 
and the intelligence-related activities of the United States 
Government, the Community Management Account, and the Central 
Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System, and for 
other purposes, submit the following joint statement to the 
House and the Senate in explanation of the effect of the action 
agreed upon by the managers and recommended in the accompanying 
conference report:
      The Senate amendment struck all of the House bill after 
the enacting clause and inserted a substitute text.
      The House recedes from its disagreement to the amendment 
of the Senate with an amendment that is a substitute for the 
House bill and the Senate amendment. The differences between 
the House bill, the Senate amendment, and the substitute agreed 
to in conference are noted below, except for clerical 
corrections, conforming changes made necessary by agreements 
reached by the conferees, and minor drafting and clerical 
changes.

                    Title I--Intelligence Activities

               sec. 101. authorization for appropriations

      Section 101 of the conference report lists the 
departments, agencies, and other elements of the United States 
Government for whose intelligence and intelligence-related 
activities the Act authorize appropriations for fiscal year 
1997.

            sec. 102. classified schedule of authorizations

      Section 102 of the conference report makes clear that the 
details of the amounts authorized to be appropriated for 
intelligence and intelligence-related activities and applicable 
personnel ceilings covered under this title for fiscal year 
1997 are contained in a classified Schedule of Authorizations. 
The Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated into the Act by 
this section. The details of the Schedule are explained in the 
classified annex to this report.

                sec. 103. personnel ceiling adjustments

      Section 103 of the conference report authorizes the 
Director of Central Intelligence, with the approval of the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in fiscal year 
1997 to exceed the personnel ceilings applicable to the 
components of the Intelligence Community under section 102 by 
an amount not to exceed two percent of the total of the 
ceilings applicable under section 102. The Director may 
exercise this authority only when doing so is necessary to the 
performance of important intelligence functions. Any exercise 
of this authority must be reported to the two intelligence 
committees of the Congress.
      The conferees emphasize that the authority conferred by 
Section 103 is not intended to permit the wholesale raising of 
personnel strength in any intelligence component. Rather, the 
section provides the Director of Central Intelligence with 
flexibility to adjust personnel levels temporarily for 
contingencies and for overages caused by an imbalance between 
hiring of new employees and attrition of current employees. The 
conferees do not expect the Director of Central Intelligence to 
allow heads of intelligence components to plan to exceed levels 
set in the Schedule of Authorizations except for the 
satisfaction of clearly identified hiring needs which are 
consistent with the authorization of personnel strengths in 
this bill. In no case is this authority to be used to provide 
for positions denied by this bill.

                 sec. 104. community management account

      Section 104 of the conference report authorizes 
appropriations for the Community Management Account of the 
Director of Central Intelligence and sets the personnel end-
strength for the Intelligence Community Management Staff for 
fiscal year 1997,
      Subsection (a) authorizes appropriations of $131,116,000 
for fiscal year 1997 for the activities of the Community 
Management Account (CMA) of the Director of Central 
Intelligence. This amount includes funds identified for the 
Advanced Research and Development Committee, which shall remain 
available for two years.
      Subsection (b) authorizes 303 full-time personnel for the 
Community Management Staff for fiscal year 1997 and provides 
that such personnel may be permanent employees of the Staff or 
detailed from various elements of the United States Government.
      Subsection (c) requires that personnel be detailed on a 
reimbursable basis except for temporary situations of less than 
one year.
      Subsection (d) authorizes $27,000,000 of the total CMA to 
be made available for the National Drug Intelligence Center 
(NDIC) in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Subsection (d) is similar to 
section 104(e) of the House bill. The House bill authorized 35 
positions at NDIC to be funded in the National Foreign 
Intelligence Program (NFIP). The conferees agreed that these 
positions will continue to be funded in the Department of 
Defense Community Management Account.
      The Attorney General and the DCI have agreed to designate 
the NDIC as an element of the intelligence community, pursuant 
to section 3(4)(J) of the National Security Act of 1947, and 
accordingly the DCI shall approve the NDIC budget before its 
incorporation into the NFIP, pursuant to Section 104(b) of the 
National Security Act. The conferees anticipate that, as with 
the budget for the National Security Division of the FBI, the 
DCI will ordinarily approve the Attorney General's proposed 
budget for the NDIC without change or will make changes in the 
NDIC budget only after consultation with the Attorney General. 
Moreover, even though NDIC will be funded in the NFIP, the 
conferees emphasize that the DCI should not exercise direction 
or control over the operations of the NDIC. The conferees note 
that section 103(d)!1) of the National Security Act provides 
that the Central Intelligence Agency shall have no ``law 
enforcement powers.'' Although section 103(d)(1) specifically 
applies only to the CIA and not to the DCI, because the DCI is 
both head of the intelligence community and head of the CIA, 
the conferees believe it is important that the DCI not appear 
to be involved in managing law enforcement activities. 
Accordingly, section 104(d) of the conference report makes 
clear that amounts appropriated for the NDIC may not be used in 
contravention of section 103(d)(1) of the Act.
      Subsection (e) authorizes $18,000,000 of the total CMA to 
be made available for the Environmental Intelligence and 
Applications Program, formerly known as the Environmental Task 
Force, to remain available for two years.

 Title II--Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System

               sec. 201. authorization of appropriations

      Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of 
$184,200,000 for fiscal year 1997 for the Central Intelligence 
Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.

                     Title III--General Provisions

sec. 301. increase in employee compensation and benefits authorized by 
                                  law

      Section 301 of the conference report provides that 
appropriations authorized by the conference report for salary, 
pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees may 
be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as may 
be necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits 
authorized by law. Section 301 is identical to section 301 of 
the House bill and section 301 of the Senate amendment.

      sec. 302. restriction on conduct of intelligence activities

      Section 302 provided that the authorization of 
appropriations by the conference report shall not be deemed to 
constitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence 
activity that is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution 
or laws of the United States. Section 302 is identical to 
section 302 of the House bill and section 302 of the Senate 
amendment.

      sec. 303. limitation of availability of funds for automatic 
             declassification of records over 25 years old

      Section 303 limits the availability of funds authorized 
to be appropriated in the National Foreign Intelligence Program 
to $27.2 million for the purpose of carrying out Section 3.4 of 
Executive Order 12958, which directs the automatic 
declassification of documents older than 25 years. The 
provision is similar to section 303 of the House bill. The 
Senate amendment contained no similar provision.
      The conferees urge the Director of Central Intelligence 
to appoint one individual within the Community Management Staff 
to oversee programs to implement Section 3.4 in the 
intelligence community. This individual should be charged with 
ensuring the programs are making progress on the substantial 
task ahead of declassifying thousands of older documents while 
adequately protecting intelligence sources and methods. The 
individual should coordinate the preparation by the individual 
NFIP programs of the programs' FY 1998 budget requests for 
funds to implement Section 3.4.

   sec. 304. application of sanctions laws to intelligence activities

      Section 304 of the conference report extends until 
January 6, 1998 the authority granted by section 303 of the 
Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 for the 
President to stay the imposition of an economic, cultural, 
diplomatic, or other sanction or related action when the 
President determines and reports to Congress that to proceed 
without delay would seriously risk the compromise of an 
intelligence source or method or an ongoing criminal 
investigation. Section 304 is identical to Section 303 of the 
Senate amendment and similar to section 304 of the House bill.

                   sec. 305. expedited naturalization

      Section 305 provides for naturalization of certain 
applicants without their having met the normal statutory 
requirements relating to continuous residency and physical 
presence in the United States and lack of recent affiliation 
with the Communist Party or other totalitartion organization. 
The section would apply to the spouse, son, or daughter of a 
deceased alien whose death resulted from the intentional and 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information (such as by 
convicted spy Aldrich Ames) regarding the alien's participation 
in U.S. intelligence activities. Existing law provides for 
expedited naturalization for aliens who themselves have made 
extraordinary contributions to the national security of the 
United States or to U.S. intelligence activities.
      Naturalization benefits under this provision would have 
to be approved by the Director of Central Intelligence, the 
Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Immigration and 
Naturalization. Expedited naturalization would not be 
available, however, to aliens whom the Attorney General 
determines to have engaged in racial, religious, ethnic, or 
political persecution or to constitute a danger to the 
community or to the security of the United States.
      Section 305 is identical to Section 305 of the House 
bill. The Senate amendment had no similar provision.

 sec. 306. sense of the congress on intelligence identities protection 
                                  act

      Section 306 expresses the sense of the Congress that the 
Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 
et seq.) should be enforced by appropriate law enforcement 
agencies. The provision is identical to Section 306 of the 
House bill. The Senate amendment had no similar provision.
      The Intelligence Identities Protection Act makes it a 
crime for anyone with authorized access to classified 
information identifying a covert agent of the United States to 
disclose any information identifying that agent to an 
individual not authorized to receive classified information, 
knowing that information identifies the covert agent and that 
the U.S. is taking affirmative measures to conceal such covert 
agent's intelligence relationship to the United States.
      The conferees believe the Act should be enforced. The 
provision reflects concern about the apparent unwillingness of 
the Department of Justice to enforce the Act in several recent 
cases involving public officials and journalists. The conferees 
recognize that the decision whether to bring a prosecution 
under the Identities Act involves careful consideration of: 
whether each element of the offense can be proven; in those 
cases in which it is determined that each element of the 
offense can be proven, the need to deter future unauthorized 
disclosures; and an assessment of the risk of additional 
disclosures of classified information at trial. The conferees 
believe the Classified Information Procedures Act, enacted by 
Congress in 1980, can be used effectively to lessen the risks 
with using classified information in criminal trials. The 
conferees further believe that concerns about possible 
additional disclosures at trial should not be the sole 
determinant of whether the Identities Act is enforced.
      In addition to the disclosures of agent identities, the 
conferees are concerned about the apparent increase in the 
public disclosure of sensitive national security information 
generally. These disclosures have placed lives at risk and, in 
at least one instance, may have contributed to a number of 
deaths. The intelligence oversight committees have expressed 
intense concern to both the DCI and the Justice Department and 
will continue to exercise appropriate oversight into the 
measures and policies for safeguarding sensitive information.

              sec. 307. intelligence community procurement

      Section 307 expresses the sense of the Congress that the 
Director of Central Intelligence should continue to direct 
elements of the intelligence community to award contracts in a 
manner that would maximize the procurement of products produced 
in the United States, when such action is compatible with the 
national security interests of the United States, consistent 
with operational and security concerns, and fiscally sound. A 
provision similar to Section 307 has been contained in previous 
intelligence authorization acts. Section 307 is similar in 
intent to Sections 307 through 309 of the House bill. The 
Senate amendment had no similar provision.

 sec. 308. restrictions on intelligence sharing with the united nations

      Section 308 reflects the desire of the conferees to 
improve oversight over the sharing of U.S. intelligence with 
the United Nations and the safeguarding of such intelligence by 
the U.N. through improved security practices. The provision 
prohibits sharing of intelligence with the U.N. unless the 
President certifies that (1) procedures are in place to protect 
information provided from unauthorized disclosure of U.S. 
intelligence sources and methods, or (2) that providing such 
information is in the U.S. national interest. It also requires 
the President to provide semiannual reports to Congress on the 
types and volume of intelligence information provided to the 
U.N. and to report to Congress any unauthorized disclosure of 
intelligence information provided.
      The provision is identical to Section 310 of the House 
bill. The Senate amendment had no similar provision.

     sec. 309. prohibition on using journalists as agents or assets

      Section 309 of the conference report would codify as 
policy of the United States that the intelligence community may 
not use as an agent or asset for intelligence collection 
purposes any individual who is either: authorized by contract 
or the issuance of press credentials to represent himself or 
herself, either in the United States or abroad, as a 
correspondent of a United States news media organization or is 
officially recognized by a foreign government as a 
representative of a United States media organization. The 
prohibition against the use of such individuals as intelligence 
agents or assets is not to exclude the voluntary cooperation of 
any person who is aware that the cooperation is being provided 
to an element of the intelligence community. Additionally, 
under such procedures as the President shall promulgate, the 
prohibition against the use of journalists may be waived by 
either the President or the Director of Central Intelligence 
(DCI) if he or she determines in writing that the waiver is 
necessary to address the overriding national security interests 
of the United States. The congressional intelligence committees 
shall be notified of any waivers provided under this section.
      Section 309 is similar to section 311 of the House bill. 
The Senate amendment did not contain a similar provision.
      The conferees recognize the dangers faced by journalists 
working overseas if they are suspected of being spies. Section 
309 is intended to mitigate that danger to the maximum extent 
possible while providing the flexibility to deal with those 
extremely rare circumstances in which the national security 
interests of the United States can best be promoted by 
utilizing the voluntary cooperation of a journalist.

  sec. 310. report on intelligence community policy on protecting the 
     national information infrastructure against strategic attacks

      Section 301 requires the DCI to submit a report to 
Congress on the threats to the national information 
infrastructure from information warfare and other 
nontraditional attacks by foreign nations, groups, or 
individuals or other groups or individuals. Section 310 is 
similar to Section 719 of the Senate amendment except for 
drafting modifications. The House bill did not contain a 
similar provision.

                 Title IV--Central Intelligence Agency

 sec. 401. elimination of double surcharge on the central intelligence 
 agency relating to employees who retire or resign in fiscal year 1998 
    or 1999 and who receive voluntary separation incentive payments

      Section 401 corrects a discrepancy in existing law which 
currently requires the CIA to make double payments to the Civil 
Service Retirement and Disability Fund for those Agency 
employees who take an early retirement. Section 4(a) of the 
Federal Workforce Restructuring Act (FWRA) requires agencies 
that offer retirement incentives, including CIA, to pay to the 
Fund 9 percent of the final basic pay of each employee who 
takes an early retirement. In addition, section (2)(i) of the 
CIA Voluntary Separation Pay Act (CVSPA), enacted as part of 
the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, 
requires the CIA to make a 15 percent payment for each employee 
who takes an early retirement.
      It was not Congress' intent to have CIA make double 
payments totalling 24 percent to the Fund. Accordingly, Section 
401 of the conference report provides that the 15 percent 
payment CIA is required to pay under CVSPA is in lieu of the 9 
percent payment required under the FWRA.
      Section 401 is identical to section 402 of the House 
bill. The Senate amendment did not contain a similar provision.

                 sec. 402. post-employment restrictions

      Section 402 of the conference report requires the 
Director of Central Intelligence to issue regulations requiring 
designated employees of the Central Intelligence Agency to sign 
written agreements committing not to represent or advise, for a 
period of three years after that employee's termination of 
employment with the CIA, the government or political party of 
any foreign country.
      Section 402 is similar to Section 304 of the Senate 
amendment. The House bill did not contain a similar provision. 
The conferees agreed to a provision that is narrower than the 
Senate amendment in two respects. First, the written agreements 
would be required only of certain designated officials. The 
conferees expect that the DCI would designate senior Agency 
officials or others who have had significant contact with 
foreign governments such that their representation of a foreign 
government immediately after their cessation of employment with 
the Agency might create the appearance of a conflict of 
interest. Second, the restrictions would apply only for a 
period of three years, rather than five, following the 
employee's departure from CIA. The conferees have also modified 
the provision to allow the DCI to permit an employee to 
represent or advise a foreign government if the DCI determines 
that it would be in the best interest of the United States (for 
example, to allow a former CIA employee to assist an allied 
government with which the U.S. has a close liaison 
relationship).

         Title V--Department of Defense Intelligence Activities

  sec. 501. executive branch oversight of budgets of elements of the 
                         intelligence community

      Section 501 requires the President to submit a report to 
Congress on actions that have been taken to ensure adequate 
oversight by the executive branch of the budget and 
expenditures of the National Reconnaissance Office and other 
elements of the intelligence community within the Department of 
Defense. The provision is identical to Section 305 of the 
Senate amendment. The House bill did not contain a similar 
provision.

               Title VI--Federal Bureau of Investigation

                 sec. 601. access to telephone records

      Section 601 amends Sections 2703 and 2709 of Title 18, 
United States Code to clarify that the ``telephone toll billing 
records'' which the Federal Bureau of Investigation may 
subpoena in certain law enforcement investigations include not 
only long distance but also local billing records. Section 601 
also amends Section 2707 of Title 18 to allow courts to award 
punitive damages, and to institute disciplinary actions against 
employees of U.S. agencies or departments, for violations of 
Chapter 121 of Title 18.
      Section 601 is identical to Section 401 of the Senate 
amendment. The House bill did not contain a similar provision.

                  Title VII--Combatting Proliferation

      Title VII contains a number of provisions relating to 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Sections 711 
through 717 establish and define the duties of a Commission to 
Assess the Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the 
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The eight members 
of the Commission are to be appointed by the President and the 
congressional leadership. The Commission is required to conduct 
a study of the organization of the federal government, 
including the intelligence community, for combatting weapons 
proliferation. Section 711 of the conference report sets forth 
a specific list of issues for the Commission to address. The 
Commission is required to submit a report to Congress not later 
than eighteen months after enactment of this legislation. The 
conferees modified Section 717 to provide that commission 
expenses shall be paid out of funds available to the DCI for 
the payment of compensation, travel allowances, and per diem of 
CIA employees.
      Section 721 of the conference report requires the 
Director of Central Intelligence to submit a semiannual report 
to Congress on the acquisition by foreign countries of 
technology for the development of weapons of mass destruction 
and advanced conventional munitions.
      Title VII of the conference report is similar to Title VI 
of the Senate amendment. The House bill contained no similar 
provision.

       Title VIII--Renewal and Reform of Intelligence Activities

      Title VIII of the conference report contains provisions 
intended to make the Intelligence Community operate more 
effectively and more efficiently in the post-Cold War world. 
These provisions would create two committees of the National 
Security Council, one to provide better guidance to the 
intelligence community and the other to provide senior-level 
guidance on issues raised by the intersection of law 
enforcement and intelligence, particularly relating to 
terrorism, narcotics trafficking, and weapons proliferation. In 
addition, provisions in this section strengthen the ability of 
the Director of Central Intelligence to manage the Intelligence 
Community by codifying his authority to participate in the 
development of the budgets for defense-wide and tactical 
intelligence and to concur or be consulted with respect to the 
appointments of the heads of the principal NFIP agencies. 
Giving the DCI a database of all intelligence activities and 
requiring all NFIP elements to submit periodic budget execution 
reports should enable the DCI to make better use of his 
existing authorities--given to him by Congress in 1992--to 
approve the budgets of NFIP elements and to transfer funds and 
personnel with the concurrence of affected agency heads. The 
conferees urge the DCI to be more assertive in using these 
authorities. The bill also establishes a new Senate-confirmed 
Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Community 
Management and three new Senate-confirmed Assistant Directors 
of Central Intelligence to assist the DCI in managing the 
Intelligence Community. Finally, the conference report 
clarifies the authority of intelligence collection agencies to 
provide support to law enforcement agencies.
      Title VIII is similar to Title VII of the Senate 
amendment. As originally reported by the Senate Intelligence 
Committee as part of S. 1718, Title VII would have given the 
DCI budget execution authority over most elements of the 
National Foreign Intelligence Program; authority to reprogram 
funds among NFIP programs over the objection of the affected 
department head; authority to manage the national collection 
activities of the intelligence community; and shared 
responsibility--with the Secretary of Defense--for managing the 
National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, 
and the Central Imagery Office. After extensive discussions 
with the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate 
Intelligence Committee agreed to drop or modify a number of 
these provisions.
      Although the House bill, H.R. 3259, contained no similar 
provisions, the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence also undertook a major review of the roles, 
functions, and structure of the intelligence community during 
the 104th Congress. On April 9, 1996, the House Committee 
released a study entitled ``IC21: Intelligence Community in the 
21st Century,'' which set forth the findings and 
recommendations of the Committee staff. On June 13, 1996, the 
House Committee reported H.R. 3237, which would have enacted 
many of the recommendations of the staff study and would have 
made significant changes to the current organization of the 
intelligence community. The House National Security Committee, 
which took H.R. 3237 on sequential referral, deleted many of 
these provisions, and the bill was never brought to the House 
floor.
      The conferees believe that the provisions of Title VIII 
will help ensure that various elements of the intelligence 
community operate more cohesively and without unnecessary 
duplication. That the conferees agreed to more limited 
organizational changes this year does not mean that some of the 
more far-reaching changes proposed by S. 1718 and H.R. 3237 are 
without merit. To the contrary, the provisions in both bills 
were the culmination of exhaustive study by both committees as 
well as by the Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the 
U.S. Intelligence Community, the 17-member congressionally 
chartered commission which submitted its report to Congress on 
April 1, 1996, and deserve further consideration. The conferees 
specifically agreed that the DCI should study the establishment 
of an Intelligence Community Reserve and that the DCI and the 
Secretary of Defense should study the feasibility of creating a 
single technical collection agency as well as other specified 
agencies--the creation of which was recommended by the IC-21 
study. The conferees anticipate that some of the other 
provisions in S. 1718 and H.R. 3237 that were not enacted this 
year will be taken up again in the 104th Congress.

                              section 801

      Section 801 contains the short title VIII, the 
``Intelligence Renewal and Reform Act of 1996.''

                              section 802

      Section 802 amends Section 101 of the National Security 
Act of 1947 to create a Committee on Foreign Intelligence of 
the National Security Council. Section 802 is identical to 
Section 702 of the Senate amendment.

                              section 803

      Section 803 amends Section 109 of the National Security 
Act to require the President to submit an annual report to 
Congress on U.S. intelligence requirements and priorities and 
the performance of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Section 803 
is identical to Section 703 of the Senate amendment.

                              section 804

      Section 804 amends Section 101 of the National Security 
Act of 1947 to create a Committee on Transnational Threats of 
the National Security Council. Section 804 is identical to 
Section 704 of the Senate amendment.
      The Committee on Transnational Threats would identify 
transnational threats; develop strategies to respond to them in 
a coordinated way; assist in resolving operational differences 
among federal departments and agencies; develop policies and 
procedures to ensure the effective sharing of information among 
federal departments and agencies, including between the law 
enforcement and foreign policy communities; and develop 
guidelines for coordination of federal law enforcement and 
intelligence activities overseas.
      The conferees note, that in response to the growth in 
global crime and the increasing number of U.S. statutes with 
extraterritorial application, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation is significantly expanding its presence and 
activities outside the United States. The conferees are 
interested in the growth of these activities and the degree to 
which Bureau investigations, recruitment of assets, liaison 
with foreign intelligence services, and operational activities 
are coordinated with U.S. intelligence agencies. Accordingly, 
the conferees direct that, beginning no later than February 1, 
1997, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall 
submit an annual report to the appropriate congressional 
committees regarding the activities of the Bureau outside the 
United States. The report shall specify the number of Bureau 
personnel posted or detailed outside the United States and the 
extend to which the Bureau plans to increase the number of such 
personnel and/or the scope of its overseas activities. The 
report should describe how Bureau overseas investigations, 
asset handling, liaison, and operational activities are 
coordinated with the Intelligence Community, and the extent to 
which information derived from such activities is or will be 
shared with the Intelligence Community. The intelligence 
committees plan to monitor these matters closely.

                              section 805

      Section 705 of the Senate amendment would have amended 
Section 102 of the National Security Act of 1947 to add a new 
subsection (d) to establish an Office of the Director of 
Central Intelligence to include the DCI, the DDCI; the newly 
established positions of Assistant DCI for Collection, 
Assistant DCI for Analysis and Production, Assistant DCI for 
Administration, the National Intelligence Council, and such 
other offices as the DCI may designate.
      The conferees agreed to accept the provisions in the 
Senate amendment with the addition of a new Deputy Director for 
Community Management (DDCI/CM), to whom the three new Assistant 
Directors would report. This DDCI for Community Management will 
be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This 
Deputy will work under the direction of the DCI and is 
responsible for assisting him in carrying out his 
responsibilities as head of the Intelligence Community. The 
DDCI/CM will manage a community management staff and direct 
community-wide functions, including personnel, resources, 
requirements, collection, research and development, and 
analysis and production.
      The conferees recognize that there is always the 
potential that positions requiring Presidential appointment and 
Senate confirmation may be subject to inappropriate political 
pressures. This is of particular concern with respect to the 
Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Analysis and 
Production. Nevertheless, the conferees believe the significant 
advantages in terms of stature and congressional oversight 
afforded by making this a confirmable position outweigh that 
potential concern. Moreover, the intelligence oversight 
committees will be vigilant in their efforts to ensure there is 
no politicization of these positions. The extensive focus on 
charges of politicization during the Senate confirmation of 
Robert Gates to be the DCI in 1991 demonstrates the seriousness 
with which the Congress views this issue. In reviewing 
potential nominees for any of the confirmable positions within 
the Intelligence Community and in the course of its oversight, 
the Congress will look carefully for any evidence that an 
individual has tailored his or her views to curry favor with 
the Administration or Congress, or that an individual has 
suffered retribution for failing to succumb to political 
pressure.
      As amended by Section 805, section 102(d)(3) of the 
National Security Act directs the DCI to employ and utilize a 
professional staff to assist him in carrying out his Community-
wide responsibilities. This staff would be part of the Office 
of the DCI. The staff could, at the DCI's discretion, operate 
as a unit, or be divided among the Deputy Director for 
Community Management and the three new Assistant DCIs. The 
conferees anticipate that this staff would replace the 
functions of the current Community Management Staff and, while 
it should include some detailees from the Intelligence 
Community, would consist primarily of a core staff of career 
professionals.
      Section 805 also transfer the current section 102(a)(1) 
of the National Security Act, which establishes the Central 
Intelligence Agency, to a new section 102A of the National 
Security Act. Section 102A would reference Section 103(d), 
which sets forth the responsibilities of the Director of 
Central Intelligence as head of the CIA.

                              section 806

      Section 806, concerning the National Intelligence 
Council, is identical to Section 706 of the Senate amendment 
except that the NIC would also specifically be directed to 
evaluate intelligence community-wide collection and production 
activities.

                              section 807

      Section 807 strengthens the DCI's authorities as head of 
the intelligence community. It gives the DCI authority to 
participate in the development by the Secretary of Defense of 
the annual budgets for JMIP and TIARA; authority to approve 
collection requirements, determine collection priorities, and 
resolve conflicts in collection priorities levied on national 
collection assets; and the right to be consulted by the 
Secretary of Defense with respect to reprogrammings of funds 
within the JMIP.
      The provision also directs the DCI and the Secretary of 
Defense to develop, no later than January 1, 1999, a database 
of all intelligence and intelligence-related programs and 
activities, which would specify the purpose of each program or 
activity and include information for past and future years on 
the types and quantities of resources planned, programmed, 
budgeted, and executed in support of specific objectives. The 
conferees noted that the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy within the White House has recently developed a database 
of all research and development activities within the federal 
government and that this database has been invaluable for 
identifying duplication among federal R&D programs. The 
conferees believe that the DCI has been hampered in his ability 
to manage the intelligence community by a lack of accurate and 
comprehensive information about all intelligence community 
activities. Development of a database for intelligence 
activities should give the DCI crucial analytical and 
supervisory tools he needs to provide better direction to and 
control over U.S. intelligence programs. The conferees have 
provided funding for the development of the database and urge 
the DCI and the Secretary of Defense to move ahead as quickly 
as possible.
      Section 807 is similar to Section 707 of the Senate 
amendment. In addition to minor drafting changes, the provision 
has been modified to specifically require the DCI and the 
Secretary of Defense to prescribe guidelines to require 
reporting of budget execution data on all intelligence 
activities to the DCI and the Secretary of Defense. This is to 
ensure that this data is available to the DCI and Secretary of 
Defense during FY 1997 and is not held up pending development 
of the database.
      In addition, a new subsection has been added requiring 
the DCI to submit an annual report to Congress, for the next 
three years, on the steps he has taken under Section 104(f) of 
the National Security Act to rotate personnel, and to 
consolidate personnel, administrative, and security programs, 
among intelligence community elements. The DCI was given this 
authority in 1992 but appears to be making little use of it.

                              section 808

      Section 808 is identical to Section 708 of the Senate 
amendment. The Section requires the DCI to submit to the 
Committee on Foreign Intelligence and the appropriate 
congressional committees an evaluation of the performance and 
responsiveness of the NSA, NRO, and NIMA in meeting their 
national missions.

                              section 809

      Section 809(a) of the conference report adds a new 
subsection (f) to Section 102 of the National Security Act of 
1947 to establish the position of Assistant Director of Central 
Intelligence for Collection. This position will be appointed by 
the President and confirmed by the Senate.
      The ADCI for Collection will be one of three new 
Assistant Directors of Central Intelligence who will assist the 
DCI in carrying out his Community-wide management 
responsibilities. The ADCI for Collection will assist the DCI 
in carrying out his intelligence collection responsibilities. 
The ADCI for Collection will oversee all national intelligence 
collection activities, including identifying targets, setting 
priorities, and allocating resources where a particular 
intelligence collection discipline offers a comparative 
advantage. In performing this role, it is expected that the 
ADCI for Collection will be responsible for the effective and 
efficient operation of the interagency collection committees--
including those focusing on IMINT, HUMINT, SIGINT, an MASINT--
to ensure national collection requirements, priorities, and 
resources are consistent with intelligence consumer needs. 
Further, the ADCI for Collection will rely upon the ADCI for 
Analysis and Production for guidance on current collection 
requirements and for an assessment of the need for the 
acquisition of future collection capabilities. The ADCI for 
Collection will also assist in implementing the DCI's 
authorities regarding the procurement and operation of national 
collection systems under development by other agencies and 
assist the DCI in formulating plans and budgets of national 
collection activities.
      Section 809(b) requires the DCI and the Deputy Secretary 
of Defense to submit, no later than 90 days after enactment of 
this Act, a report on their efforts to coordinate and, where 
practicable, consolidate the human intelligence collection 
activities of the clandestine collection elements of the 
Defense HUMINT Service and CIA's Directorate of Operations 
(DO). The conferees note that the Aspin-Brown Commission 
recommended that the clandestine HUMINT collection activities 
of the Defense HUMINT Service be consolidated into the DO. The 
report should address the desirability of such a consolidation.

                              section 810

      Section 810 adds a new section (g) to Section 102 of the 
National Security Act of 1947 to establish the position of 
Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Analysis and 
Production. This position will be appointed by the President 
and confirmed by the Senate.
      The ADCI for Analysis and Production will assist the DCI 
in overseeing analysis and production of intelligence by the 
Intelligence Community, establish priorities for analysis, and 
monitor the allocation of resources in order to eliminate 
unnecessary duplication in analysis and production thus 
ensuring timely delivery of intelligence products to consumers.
      Intelligence analysis and production of analytical 
products is broadly dispersed across the Intelligence 
Community. Although some competitive analysis is necessary and 
some products are needed to serve only the needs of a single 
department or agency, most analysis supports the entire policy 
community. The DCI currently lacks an effective mechanism to 
review and supervise adequately intelligence analysis and 
production community-wide in order to ensure the most effective 
allocation of resources and to eliminate unnecessary 
duplication. Intelligence producers have worked together 
voluntarily to reduce overlaps, but the conferees believe that 
a better management structure is needed. The new ADCI for 
Analysis and Production would provide the basis for this 
structure. The conferees do not expect the ADCI for Analysis 
and Production to perform intelligence production functions or 
roles similar to those currently performed by the Chairman and 
members of the National Intelligence Council, CIA's Deputy 
Director for Intelligence, the Assistant Secretary of State for 
Intelligence & Research, or DIA's Director of Production.

                              section 811

      Section 811 adds a new subsection (h) to Section 102 of 
the National Security Act of 1947 to establish the position of 
Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Administration. 
This position will be appointed by the President and confirmed 
by the Senate.
      Numerous studies, including the Aspin-Brown Commission, 
have urged greater consolidation of personnel and 
administrative functions and use of common standards across the 
Intelligence Community. The largest agencies, nevertheless, 
continue to maintain separate administrative, personnel, 
security, and training systems. The Aspin-Brown Commission 
concluded ``While the Commission is willing to accept that some 
latitude is needed for individual agencies to satisfy their 
unique requirements, we see no reason for all of these programs 
and activities to be administered separately, or, at least 
without greater uniformity.'' The conferees agree with this 
conclusion.
      The role of the proposed ADCI for Administration would be 
to assist the DCI in bringing about this uniformity. The ADCI 
for Administration would coordinate the various personnel 
management systems, information systems, telecommunications 
systems, finance and accounting services, and security programs 
for the Intelligence Community. The conferees expect that the 
ADCI for Administration would also assist the DCI in exercising 
his authorities under Section 104(f) of the National Security 
Act to consolidate personnel, administrative, and security 
programs of Intelligence Community elements.

                              section 812

      Section 812 amends Section 5315 of Title 5, United States 
Code, to place the positions of Deputy Director of Central 
Intelligence and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for 
Community Management at Executive Level III and the positions 
of Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Collection, 
Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for Analysis and 
Production, Assistant Director of Central Intelligence for 
Administration, at Level IV of the Executive Schedule. Section 
812 is similar to Section 712 of the Senate amendment.

                              section 813

      Section 813, which establishes the statutory position of 
General Counsel of the CIA, is identical to Section 713 of the 
Senate amendment, except that the conferees have modified the 
provision to provide that it shall take effect no later than 
six months from the date of enactment of this Act or upon the 
appointment of a General Counsel other than the individual 
occupying the position on the date of enactment of this Act, 
whichever is sooner. Thus, whoever occupies the non-statutory 
position of General Counsel at the time this provision is 
enacted may continue to occupy that position for up to six 
months after enactment before a formal nomination must be 
submitted to the Senate. Nothing in the provision would prevent 
the President from nominating the individual serving as non-
statutory General Counsel at the time of enactment for the 
statutory General Counsel position. It is the intent of the 
conferees, however, that the President either nominate this 
individual to be the statutory General Counsel within six 
months of the date of enactment of this Act or, if this 
individual leaves the position of non-statutory General Counsel 
in less than six months, that the President nominate another 
individual to fill the statutory General Counsel position.
      The conferees do not intend in any way that the 
establishment of the statutory General Counsel position limit 
the ability of the CIA Inspector General to obtain independent 
legal advice from members of the IG's staff or to otherwise 
carry out the duties of that office as provided for in section 
17 of the CIA Act of 1949 (50 USC 403q). However, where an IG 
determination or report includes a legal opinion that differs 
from that of the CIA's Office of General Counsel, that 
difference of opinion should be noted. This would apply to 
reports presented to the DCI, briefings for Congress, or any 
other context in which IG legal opinions are presented.

                              section 814

      Section 814 creates a new Section 105A of the National 
Security Act that authorizes intelligence community elements to 
collect information about non-U.S. persons outside the United 
States at the request of U.S. law enforcement agencies. The 
section is identical to Section 715 of the Senate amendment, 
except that the Defense Intelligence Agency has been added to 
the list of Department of Defense agencies to which this 
provision applies.

                              section 815

      Section 815 amends Section 106 of the National Security 
Act to require the DCI to concur in, or be consulted regarding, 
the appointment of the heads of the principal NFIP elements. 
Section 815 is identical to Section 716 of the Senate 
amendment, with two modifications.
      First, the Director of the National Imagery and Mapping 
Agency has been added to the list of agency heads for which DCA 
concurrence is required. This authority had originally been 
included separately in provisions relating to the appointment 
of the Director of NIMA. The conferees note that the conference 
report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 1997 also codifies the DCI's authority to concur in 
the appointments of the heads of NSA, NRO, and NIMA in Section 
201 of Title 10, U.S. Code. The DoD bill also requires the DCI 
to provide to the Secretary of Defense an annual evaluation of 
the performance of the heads of NSA, NRO, and NIMA in 
fulfilling their responsibilities under the NFIP.
      In addition, the conferees have modified the original 
Senate language regarding DCI consultation on the Assistant 
Director, National Security Division of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. This individual is selected by the Attorney 
General upon the recommendation of the Director of FBI. The 
bill now calls for timely notice to the DCI of the Director of 
FBI's recommendation regarding this position. The conferees 
understand that for the purposes of this section timely notice 
means notice will be provided at a sufficiently early stage in 
the process that consultation is still meaningful and that the 
DCI will be provided sufficient time to respond to the 
notification prior to the recommendation being forwarded to the 
Attorney General. At the same time, the DCI should not use this 
opportunity for consultation as a means of delaying this 
process.
      The conferees also emphasize that, by requiring the DCI 
to be consulted regarding the appointment of the head of the 
FBI's National Security Division, they do not intend to give 
the DCI control over FBI law enforcement activities. 
Nevertheless, the head of the National Security Division 
manages a significant portion, both in budgetary and 
substantive terms, of the NFIP, and the conferees believe it is 
wholly appropriate that the DCI have some voice in his or her 
appointment.

                              section 816

      Section 816 of the conference report directs the DCI, in 
consultation with the Deputy Secretary of Defense, to study the 
appropriate organization and management of intelligence 
collection for the future. A report on the study is to be 
forwarded to the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the 
appropriate Congressional committees no later than April 15, 
1997. The conferees expect that the Assistant DCI for 
Collection will manage the production of this study on behalf 
of the DCI.
      The study should examine how the Intelligence Community's 
collection apparatus can best function in the future, and not 
merely perform an examination of the effectiveness of the 
Intelligence Community at present or in the recent past, except 
to the extent such an examination illuminates the direction 
that must be taken in the future. The section specifies that 
the study must specifically include, but need not be limited 
to, feasibility studies of three changes to the current 
Intelligence Community structure: (1) the establishment of a 
Clandestine Service; (2) the establishment of a Technical 
Collection Agency; and (3) the establishment of a Technology 
Development Office.
      The study should consider the merits of establishing a 
Clandestine Service responsible for the clandestine collection 
of intelligence through human sources and other clandestine 
means; the carrying out of covert action as directed by the 
President; and acting as the DCI's principal entity in carrying 
out liaison with foreign intelligence and security services. 
The study should keep in mind that this particular entity, the 
Clandestine Service (unlike the others under consideration), 
would have roles and missions outside the realm of intelligence 
collection. The study should also pay particular attention to 
the fact that a Clandestine Service's activities are, generally 
speaking, intrinsically risky and require the close oversight 
of the DCI. The study should also consider how military 
personnel might be integrated into a Clandestine Service in a 
manner allowing their proper career development and their being 
able to function as clandestine collectors under operational 
guidelines developed under DCI authorities.
      The study should consider the costs and benefits 
associated with consolidating technical collection activities 
and exploitation into a single agency, not necessarily in one 
physical location but under a unified management structure. 
This agency would include all current signals intelligence, 
imagery intelligence and measurement and signatures 
intelligence collection and time-sensitive exploitation 
activities, including the operation of satellite collection 
systems. The study should consider whether consolidation would 
improve synergistic collection at the operator level, integrate 
multi-source tasking at the collection management level, and 
achieve cross-discipline trade-offs at the resources management 
level. The study should consider in particular how the agency 
as proposed would further or hinder these goals, and whether 
such a consolidation would further or hinder other identified 
goals for intelligence collection. This study should also 
examine whether the first-phase analysts exploiting the data 
collected for time-sensitive reporting should be integrated 
with the all-source analytical community and, if so, how.
      The study should also consider the costs and benefits of 
consolidating research, development and acquisition activities 
for reconnaissance systems into a single agency responsible 
primarily for space-based, airborne and maritime reconnaissance 
systems. The study should consider whether consolidation would 
improve coherent development and complementary architectures, 
particularly in the space and air realms; promote development 
of common ground processing and dissemination capabilities; 
reduce unnecessary duplication; and promote the sharing of 
appropriate technologies.
      Section 816 is a new provision. No similar provision was 
included in either the House bill or Senate amendment.

                              section 817

      Section 817 of the conference report requires the DCI to 
submit a report within four months of enactment describing the 
current efforts to establish a Surge Augmentation Program and 
making appropriate legislative recommendations.
      The conferees believe that significant reductions in 
personnel and other resources throughout the Intelligence 
Community over the past few years, combined with significant 
increases in the need for intelligence information, have 
created a shortfall in analytic resources, especially in the 
areas of all-source analysis and linguists. Ad hoc crises, such 
as Rwanda and Somalia, further underscore the need for the 
Intelligence Community to be flexible enough to ``surge'' 
resources to meet immediate needs and to have a capability to 
augment existing resources in order to develop and maintain a 
worldwide ``base'' of knowledge. Such an intelligence ``base'' 
should allow for identification of trends and other changes 
that could portend future actions by U.S. policy makers. This 
warning function becomes critical both to the policy maker by 
providing adequate time to manage an impending situation before 
it develops into a crisis and to the military commander in 
cases where the proper policy response includes military 
activity. DCI Deutch has been addressing the same concerns in 
his ``Hard Target/Global Coverage'' efforts.
      The conferees note that it is unlikely that internal 
Intelligence Community resources will ever be robust enough to 
meet all of the requirements that will be levied on them. The 
ability to augment existing resources with individuals who have 
intelligence experience and/or have maintained a level of 
substantive knowledge could prove invaluable in addressing what 
appears to be an ongoing pattern of small, often regional 
crises and situations. In this respect, a portion of the Surge 
Augmentation Program, or ``Intelligence Community Reserve,'' 
could operate similarly to existing military intelligence 
reserve resources, with periodic training and service within 
the Community in order to maintain expertise. In some cases, 
individuals who are our country's experts in certain areas are 
likely to be outside of the Intelligence Community--in industry 
or academia, for example--and should remain so in order to 
maintain their level of knowledge and contacts worldwide. In 
those cases, however, it would be extremely beneficial for the 
Intelligence Community to have access to this knowledge on an 
occasional basis. Although it is not envisioned that someone 
outside of the Intelligence Community would be asked to 
``serve'' the Intelligence Community Reserve in the same 
capacity as those individuals who have had a prior association, 
it is envisioned that these ``experts'' might be held on a type 
of retainer requiring them to notify the Intelligence Community 
on a regular basis of significant trends and changes in their 
issue area. In addition, particular attention should be paid to 
building a linguistic ``surge'' capability, especially in more 
unique or less known languages, for use during crisis periods. 
Finally, the conferees believe that the Intelligence Community 
Reserve should be managed and funded at the Community level, 
ensuring that all valid ``surge'' requirements by all agencies/
offices within the Intelligence Community are planned for and 
addressed as necessary.
      Due to the complexities of issues such as pay, security, 
training and support, the conferees are not establishing the 
Reserve in legislation at this time. Instead, the DCI is 
directed to provide a report on current efforts and any 
legislation that might be considered by Congress.
      Finally, the conferees note that the Intelligence 
Community Reserve is not envisioned as a panacea for addressing 
shortfalls in intelligence analytical expertise. Clearly, 
specific attention must be paid toward maintaining an 
experienced analytic workforce in specific subject areas that 
are of national security and policy concern.

                   Title IX--Miscellaneous Provisions

   SEC. 901. AUTHORIZATION OF FUNDING PROVIDED BY 1996 SUPPLEMENTAL 
                           APPROPRIATIONS ACT

      Section 901 of the conference report is identical to 
section 601 of the House bill. The Senate amendment did not 
contain a similar provision. The section provides that funds 
appropriated as part of the supplemental appropriation in the 
Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 
for intelligence, and intelligence-related activities in Bosnia 
shall be deemed to be specifically authorized for purposes of 
Section 504 of the National Security Act.
Provisions not included in the Conference Report
            Multiyear leasing
      Section 401 of the House bill would have amended the 
Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to authorize the CIA to 
enter into multiyear leases for buildings and other facilities. 
However, an amendment added on the House floor would have 
required that the leases be fully funded in advance. As this 
requirement would have vitiated the effectiveness of the 
provision, the conferees agreed to drop it.
            Intelligence Community personnel reforms
      On April 23, 1996 DCI Deutch unveiled a CIA human 
resources reform initiative that will affect Intelligence 
Community personnel at the CIA and in various DoD agencies. The 
presentation of the personnel reform package had been long 
awaited by both intelligence committees as the DCI had stated 
on numerous occasions the priority he was attaching to 
revamping an ancient and antiquated personnel system. The 
sweeping nature of the CIA human resources reform proposal and 
the initial lack of specificity concerning its contents led the 
House Committee to include a provision in its bill (Section 
403) to prevent expenditure of any funds until the Congress was 
fully briefed. The Senate amendment did not contain a similar 
provision. The CIA has now provided extensive briefings to both 
committees regarding its program; therefore, the conferees have 
agreed to drop the House provision.
      The conferees have provided funding for the CIA personnel 
reform initiative albeit at a level substantially below the 
requested amount. The funding level is contained in the 
classified schedule of authorizations. The conferees concur 
with the CIA's view that the initial priorities should be the 
acquisition and installation of a new Human Resources 
Information System, the completion of a job skills analysis and 
implementation of associated training and educational programs.
      The conferees initially understood that the CIA would 
issue a ``Request for Proposal'' (RFP) for the Human Resources 
Information System software component, but without informing 
the Congress, the CIA changed course and decided not to compete 
the contract. It is the view of the conferees that RFP's help 
to immunize the CIA from potential protests and enable the CIA, 
in the most transparent way possible, to identify the best 
contractor at the lower cost. Apparently, following a 
refinement of the requirements and the completion of an 
exhaustive market survey of the various software packages 
available, it was determined that only one vendor met and 
demonstrated the CIA's software requirements. Thus, the CIA 
expects to issue a single source contract in keeping with 
standard contracting procedures. It is the conferees 
understanding that the single source contract is for the 
acquisition of the software package only and that the systems 
integration, systems engineering and implementation components 
of the Human Resources Information System will be competitively 
bid. The conferees expect to be kept fully and currently 
informed of this process.
            FOIA exemptions for certain defense agencies
      Section 501 of the House bill would have amended and 
consolidated the information disclosure statutes for the 
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the National 
Reconnaissance (NRO), 10 U.S.C. 424 and 425 respectively, to 
permit the two organizations to withhold from release in 
response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests 
unclassified information relating to those agencies' 
organization, functions, and personnel. The Senate amendment 
did not contain a similar provision. The House recedes.
      The conferees note that Section 1112 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 included a 
provision, added at conference, that is similar to Section 501 
of the House bill but that covers personnel and organizational 
information of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) 
as well as of NRO and DIA. The conferees agree that it is 
legitimate to protect from disclosure personnel information 
relating to DIA, NRO, and NIMA because their employees may be 
counterintelligence targets. But the conferees have some 
reservations about providing a blanket exemption against 
disclosure of unclassified information about the organization 
and functions of these agencies. The conferees note that, when 
the NRO's information disclosure statute was enacted in 1992, 
Congress specifically declined to extend the provision to cover 
unclassified organizational information about the NRO.
      The conferees understand that the Senate Armed Services 
Committee and the House National Security Committee may 
reconsider whether the blanket exemption for all organizational 
and functional information is appropriate. In the interim, the 
conferees urge DIA, NRO, and NIMA to use the exemption 
sparingly to protect only that information which is truly 
sensitive and not as a reason to deny all FOIA requests for 
information about their organization or functions.
            Tier III minus UAV
      Section 502 of the House bill authorized an additional 
$22 million for the Tier III minus unmanned aerial vehicle. The 
Senate amendment did not contain a similar provision. The 
authorization level for this program has been included in the 
Classified Schedule of Authorizations, and accordingly the 
conferees agreed that the provision is not necessary.
            Economic espionage
      Title V of the Senate amendment contained provisions 
criminalizing theft of economic proprietary information 
undertaken on the behalf of, or with the intent to benefit, a 
foreign government or its agent. The House bill did not contain 
similar provisions.
      This legislation was initially introduced by Senator 
Arlen Specter and Senator Herb Kohl as S. 1557 (the Economic 
Espionage Act), along with additional legislation, S. 1556 (the 
Industrial Espionage Act), to provide a broader criminal 
statute for general industrial espionage. The provisions of S. 
1557 were then adopted by the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence as part of S. 1718, the Intelligence Authorization 
Act for fiscal year 1997. Subsequent to the SSCI action on this 
provision, the Senate and House adopted legislation 
encompassing provisions similar to both the Economic Espionage 
Act and the Industrial Espionage Act. Thus, the conferees 
agreed to drop this provision from the Intelligence 
Authorization Act.
            Budget disclosure
      Section 718 of the Senate amendment contained a provision 
requiring the President, as part of his annual budget 
submission to Congress, to provide in unclassified form the 
total amount appropriated by Congress for all intelligence and 
intelligence-related activities during the current fiscal year 
and the total amount requested in the budget for the next 
fiscal year. The House bill contained no similar provision. The 
Senate agreed to recede to the House.
            Office of Congressional Affairs of the DCI
      Section 714 of the Senate amendment would have 
established an Office of Congressional Affairs of the DCI to 
coordinate the congressional affairs activities of the various 
elements of the Intelligence Community. The House bill 
contained no similar provision. The conferees have decided not 
to require the creation of this office in statute. The 
conferees agree, however, that there is occasionally a need for 
a coordinated Community response to Congressional inquiries and 
recommend that the DCI specifically designate the Director of 
the Office of Congressional Affairs within the CIA as the focal 
point for such inquiries from Congress. The conferees do not 
intend by this recommendation to preclude the individual 
offices of congressional affairs within the elements of the 
Intelligence Community from responding directly to requests 
from the congressional committees.
            National Imagery and Mapping Agency
      Section 801 of the Senate amendment would have added a 
new section to the National Security Act specifying the 
national museum and collection tasking authority for the new 
National Imagery and Mapping Agency. The House bill contained 
no similar provisions.
      The conferees noted that Section 1112 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, which 
establishes and sets forth the missions for NIMA, contains 
similar provisions. These provisions were added to the Senate 
version of the Act by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which 
took the Senate bill on sequential referral from the Senate 
Armed Services Committee in order to examine the provisions 
relating to NIMA. Accordingly, the conferees agreed to exclude 
Section 801 from the conference report.

                From the Permanent Select Committee on 
                Intelligence, for consideration of the House 
                bill and the Senate amendment, and 
                modifications committed to the conference:
