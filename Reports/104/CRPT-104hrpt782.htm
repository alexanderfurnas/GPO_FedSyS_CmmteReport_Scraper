       JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE

      The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at 
the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on 
the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3816) making 
appropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal 
year ending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes, submit 
the following joint statement to the House and the Senate in 
explanation of the effects of the action agreed upon by the 
managers and recommended in the accompanying conference report.
      The language and allocations set forth in House Report 
104-679 and Senate Report 104-320 should be complied with 
unless specifically addressed to the contrary in the conference 
report and statement of the managers. Report language included 
by the House which is not contradicted by the report of the 
Senate or the conference, and Senate report language which is 
not contradicted by the report of the House or the conference 
is approved by the committee of conference. The statement of 
the managers, while repeating some report language for 
emphasis, does not intend to negate the language referred to 
above unless expressly provided herein. In cases where both the 
House report and Senate report address a particular issue not 
specifically addressed in the conference report or joint 
statement of managers, the conferees have determined that the 
House and Senate reports are not inconsistent and are to be 
interpreted accordingly. In cases in which the House or Senate 
have directed the submission of a report, such report is to be 
submitted to both House and Senate Committees on 
Appropriations.
      Senate amendment: The Senate deleted the entire House 
bill after the enacting clause and inserted the Senate bill. 
The conference agreement includes a revised bill.

                                TITLE I

                      Department of Defense--Civil

      The summary tables at the end of this title set forth the 
conference agreement with respect to the individual 
appropriations, programs, and activities of the Corps of 
Engineers. Additional items of conference agreement are 
discussed below.

                         Department of the Army

                       Corps of Engineers--Civil

      The conference agreement appropriates $153,872,000 for 
General Investigations instead of $153,628,000 as proposed by 
the House and $154,557,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      On July 11, 1996, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for 
Civil Works advised the committees of a proposal to modify 
current Corps of Engineers guidance governing the 
reconnaissance phase of the study process. Under the proposal, 
the scope of the reconnaissance phase would be returned to that 
envisioned by section 905(b) of the Water Resources Development 
Act of 1986, which is to develop a preliminary appraisal of the 
Federal interest, benefits, costs, and environmental impacts of 
a potential project, develop a scope of work for the 
feasibility study, and negotiate a feasibility study cost-
sharing agreement. The goal would be to complete the 
reconnaissance phase within six months at a cost of 
approximately $100,000. After careful consideration, the 
conferees have decided to support this initiative and have 
funded all new reconnaissance studies at the $100,000 level. 
The conferees have been assured that this initiative is a true 
efficiency move aimed at returning reconnaissance efforts back 
to the original concept for that phase and will not transfer 
cost and time to the feasibility phase of the study process. 
The conferees are also aware that the $100,000 model may not be 
suitable for all projects and expect the Corps to exercise 
appropriate judgment in adjusting the scope of the 
reconnaissance effort to accommodate the needs of particularly 
complex issues or large geographic areas.
      The conference agreement includes $500,000 for the Corps 
of Engineers to initiate studies of the navigation needs of 
several of Alaska's coastal communities. The funds will be used 
for the Western Harbors, Aleutians East Borough, Arctic Coast 
Navigation, King Cove, and Akutan Harbor reconnaissance 
studies. By combining these studies under a single heading the 
Corps of Engineers is expected to be able to accomplish the 
work substantially below the cost of addressing each project 
separately.
      The conferees agree that the Corps of Engineers may 
include the Southampton Shoal Channel and extension in the San 
Francisco Bay Bar Channel, California, reconnaissance study to 
permit a comprehensive examination of the San Francisco-to-
Stockton Ship Channel to determine the feasibility of 
increasing operating depths required for commerce and 
international trade.
      The conference agreement includes $150,000 for 
preconstruction engineering and design of the New Harmony, 
Indiana, project.
      The conferees have provided $10,750,000 for the Upper 
Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway navigation study 
instead of $10,500,000 as proposed by the House and $11,000,000 
as proposed by the Senate. The conferees direct the Corps of 
Engineers to accelerate the execution of feasibility study 
activities in accordance with the approved project study plan 
in such a manner that schedule recovery will be maximized and a 
final report will be completed as soon as practicable.
      The conference agreement includes $600,000 equally 
divided for the Corps of Engineers to undertake preconstruction 
engineering and design for the project to provide flood 
protection to the Green Ridge and Plot sections of the 
Lackawanna River, Scranton, Pennsylvania, project as proposed 
by the Senate. The House had proposed to fund this work under 
the Construction, General, account.
      The conferees have provided $100,000 for a reconnaissance 
study of the need for channel deepening in the Port of New York 
and New Jersey and $100,000 to initiate a feasibility study 
should the reconnaissance effort demonstrate a Federal interest 
in the project.
      The conference agreement includes $100,000 for the Corps 
of Engineers to initiate a reconnaissance study leading to a 
Master Plan of the Wing Deer Park on Boone Lake in Johnson 
City, Tennessee.
      The conference agreement includes $100,000 for the Corps 
of Engineers to initiate a reconnaissance study of 
environmental restoration opportunities along the Upper Jordan 
River, Utah, that includes examining water quality, wetland 
habitat, and flood control as a means of restoring the 
watershed of the Jordan River Basin. The conferees direct the 
Corps to review and recommend modifications to the Jordan River 
Stability Study conducted by Salt Lake County.
      The conference agreement includes a total of $6,280,000 
for Coordination Studies With Other Agencies instead of 
$4,280,000 as proposed by the House and $8,040,000 as proposed 
by the Senate. The conferees expect the Corps to use the funds 
provided to accomplish the highest priority work among the 
various activities funded under this program. In addition, the 
Corps is directed to use $450,000 to continue to participate in 
the interagency ecosystem management task force's Pacific 
Northwest forest case study as described in the Senate Report. 
The conferees agree with the language in the House report 
regarding the Planning Assistance to States program.
      The conferees have provided $27,000,000 for the Corps of 
Engineers' Research and Development program. Within the funds 
provided, the conferees have provided $300,000 to continue the 
Corps of Engineers Construction Technology Transfer project and 
$1,600,000 for cost-shared research and development and 
installation of composite pilings as describe in the Senate 
report. The conferees also are in agreement with the language 
in the House report regarding the CFIRMS project.
      The conferees have included language in the bill 
earmarking funds for the following projects in the amounts 
specified: Norco Bluffs, California, $180,000; San Joaquin 
River Basin, Caliente Creek, California, $150,000; Tampa 
Harbor, Alafia Channel, Florida, $100,000; Lake George, Hobart, 
Indiana, $100,000; Little Calumet River Basin, Cady Marsh 
Ditch, Indiana, $200,000; Tahoe Basin Study, Nevada and 
California, $100,000; Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg Harbor 
Inlet, New Jersey, $300,000; Brigantine Inlet to Great Egg 
Harbor Inlet, New Jersey, $360,000; Great Egg Harbor Inlet to 
Townsends Inlet, New Jersey, $200,000; Manasquan Inlet to 
Barnegat Inlet, New Jersey, $250,000; Townsends Inlet to Cape 
May Inlet, New Jersey, $245,000; South Shore of Staten Island, 
New York, $200,000; Mussers Dam, Middle Creek, Snyder County, 
Pennsylvania, $450,000; Rhode Island South Coast, Habitat 
Restoration and Storm Damage Reduction, Rhode Island, $100,000; 
Monongahela River, West Virginia, $500,000; Monongahela River, 
Fairmont, West Virginia, $100,000; and Tygart River Basin, 
Philippi, West Virginia, $100,000.
      The conference agreement deletes funds earmarked in the 
Senate bill for the Red River Navigation, Southwest, Arkansas, 
study.
      The conference agreement also deletes language contained 
in the Senate bill earmarking funds for studies of Coastal 
Navigation Improvements in Alaska, the Walker River Basin in 
Nevada, and the Bolinas Lagoon in California. Funding for those 
studies has been included in the overall amount appropriated 
for General Investigations.
      The conferees are aware of recent efforts by the Corps of 
Engineers to increase the use of the private sector in 
performing, planning, engineering and design work for Corps 
projects. However, the conferees believe that the Corps of 
Engineers needs to intensify those efforts. The conferees 
expect the Corps, on a programmatic basis, to achieve a goal of 
having the private sector perform at least 35% of planning, and 
40% of engineering, design work and construction phase services 
for projects as defined in 40 U.S.C. 541-544. Additionally, in 
those instances where a district office has not achieved a 
contracting level of at least 25% of planning, engineering, 
design work and construction phase services for projects in 
that district, private sector contracting should be increased 
by 10 percentage points in fiscal year 1997 and in each 
subsequent fiscal year until the level of work contracted to 
the private sector reaches at least 25%; however, in no case 
shall the actual increase per year be less than 5 percentage 
points. It is not the conferees' intent that the Corps reduce 
the contracting levels in those offices that are already 
conducting more than 35% of planning, and 40% of engineering, 
design work and construction phase services with the private 
sector. Contracting with the private sector as set forth above 
shall continue to be conducted in compliance with the normal 
qualification based selection process found in 40 U.S.C. 541-
544.

                         construction, general

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,081,942,000 for 
Construction, General, instead of $1,035,394,000 as proposed by 
the House and $1,049,306,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $2,000,000 for the 
Sacramento River, Glen-Colusa Irrigation District, California, 
project, the same as the budget request and the amount provided 
by the House and the Senate. This project is an integral part 
of the effort to develop a long-term solution to the fish 
passage problem at the Hamilton City pumping plant. It is the 
conferees' intent that the Corps of Engineers participate in, 
and, when necessary, provide direct support to this important 
Federal-state effort.
      The conference agreement provides $4,000,000 for the Palm 
Beach County, Florida, project. Of the funds provided, 
$1,919,000 is for the Jupiter/Carlin segment as proposed in the 
budget request. The remaining funds are to be used for the Boca 
Raton and Ocean Ridge segments of the project.
      The conference agreement includes $1,200,000 for the 
Corps of Engineers to reimburse the local sponsor for the 
Federal share of costs associated with renourishment of the 
Captiva Island segment of the Lee County, Florida, project.
      The conferees are in agreement with the language in the 
House and Senate reports regarding the Missouri River Levee 
System project.
      The conference agreement includes $17,025,000 for the 
Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity (Hurricane Protection), 
Louisiana, project. Of the amount provided above the budget 
request, $4,500,000 shall be used for levee raising and 
landside runoff control for Jefferson Parish lakefront levees 
and $8,500,000 shall be used to continue construction of 
parallel protection along the Orleans Avenue and London Avenue 
outfall canals. In addition, $1,500,000 has been provided for 
the West Bank-East of Harvey Canal, Louisiana, project.
      The conferees have provided $17,500,000 for the Southeast 
Louisiana, Louisiana, project. These funds are to be used to 
continue engineering, design, and construction of projects to 
provide for flood control and improvements to rainfall drainage 
systems in Jefferson, Orleans, and St. Tammany Parishes, 
Louisiana, in accordance with the following reports of the New 
Orleans District Engineer: Jefferson and Orleans Parishes, 
Louisiana, Urban Flood Control and Water Quality Management, 
July 1992; Tangipahoa, Techefuncte and Tickfaw Rivers, 
Louisiana, June 1991; St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, June 1996; 
and Schneider Canal, Slidell, Louisiana, Hurricane Protection, 
May 1990; all of which are authorized for construction by 
Public Law 104-46.
      The conferees have provided $250,000 for the Grand Isle 
and Vicinity, Louisiana, project to initiate preconstruction 
engineering and design on the modifications to the authorized 
hurricane protection project to include shoreline protection 
features on the north side of the island and to continue 
construction of breakwaters.
      Within funds provided for the South Central Pennsylvania 
Environmental Restoration Infrastructure and Resource 
Protection Development Pilot Program, the conferees have 
provided $500,000 for the Redstone Township project.
      The conference agreement provides $1,000,000 each for the 
Arkansas City, Kansas, and Winfield, Kansas, projects as 
proposed by the Senate. The conferees are aware that the 
Winfield project is ahead of schedule and, therefore, the two-
phase approach to construction described in the Senate report 
is not required for that project.
      The conferees recognize the need to widen the Port of 
Freeport, Texas, navigation channel at the intersection of the 
Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the bend located in the inner 
harbor in order to complete the channel deepening project. The 
conferees are also aware that during the period of 
construction, approximately $16,000,000 appropriated for the 
project was reprogrammed by the Corps of Engineers to other 
projects. Therefore, the conferees would not object to the 
Corps of Engineers' reprogramming of available funds back to 
the Freeport Harbor project to complete this important work.
      The conference agreement includes $32,650,000 for the 
section 205 program as proposed by the Senate. Using those 
funds, the Corps of Engineers is directed to undertake the 
projects described in the House and Senate reports. The 
conference agreement includes $3,916,000 for the Muscle Shoals, 
Alabama, project, $2,950,000 for the St. Peters Old Town Levee, 
Missouri, project, and $3,370,000 for the Cedar River at 
Renton, Washington, project. In addition, the conferees have 
learned of the harmful effects of local flooding along St. 
Asaph's Creek in Stanford, Kentucky, and along Hanging Fork 
Creek in Hustonville, Kentucky, and direct the Corps of 
Engineers to conduct a study to determine causes and possible 
remedies to this condition.
      The conference agreement includes $9,500,000 for the 
section 14 program as proposed by the House. Using those funds,

agreement includes $395,000 for the Washington-on-the-Brazos, 
Texas, project as proposed by the House.
      The conference agreement includes $5,800,000 for the 
section 103 program as proposed by the House. Using those 
funds, the Corps of Engineers is directed to undertake the 
projects described in the House and Senate reports. The amount 
provided for the Lummi Shore Road, Washington, project is 
$1,700,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $11,632,000 for the 
section 107 program. Using those funds, the Corps of Engineers 
is directed to undertake the projects described in the House 
and Senate reports. In addition, within available funds, 
$100,000 is provided to initiate a feasibility study for the 
Tennessee River in Bridgeport, Jackson County, Alabama.
      The conferees direct the Corps of Engineers to undertake 
the Walker River Basin, Nevada, project under the section 208 
program as described in the House report.
      The conference agreement includes $17,000,000 for the 
section 1135 program. Using those funds, the Corps of Engineers 
is directed to undertake the projects described in the House 
and Senate reports except the Bernado Waterfowl Management Area 
project in New Mexico. The conferees understand that the local 
sponsor for that project no longer wishes to participate in the 
project and, therefore, funding is not needed.
      The conference agreement includes a total of $41,426,000 
for the Levisa and Tug Forks of the Big Sandy River and Upper 
Cumberland River project. In addition to the amounts provided 
in the budget request, the conference agreement includes:

whether the project, as currently formulated, would achieve its 
goals, and to provide recommendations of the Corps as to future 
program options and potential enhancement which would achieve 
these goals in the most timely and cost effective manner.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate that directs the President of the Mississippi River 
Commission to use the variable cost recovery rate set forth in 
OMB Circular A-126 for use of the Commission aircraft.
      In addition, the conference agreement includes language 
directing the Secretary of the Army to use additional funds 
appropriated in this Act or previously appropriated funds to 
complete the Hickman Bluff, Kentucky, project.
      The conferees have provided $965,000 to continue the 
Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, feasibility study. 
The conferees recommended that the Corps of Engineers use an 
appropriate amount of the funds provided to prepare a report on 
the feasibility of expending the construction of a lock 
structure in the Houma Navigation Canal as an independent 
feature of this study authority.
      The conferees are concerned about the abnormal annual 
flooding that occurs to industries and businesses along the 
waterfront areas of Morgan City and Berwick, Louisiana. The 
conferees understand that a means to solve the problem is 
pending authorization. This plan includes provisions for 
temporary flood proofing and for the study of a long-term 
solution including the relocation of riverside industries to a 
safe non-flood area in the vicinity. The Corps of Engineers 
should proceed immediately to construction upon passage of the 
authorization of this project with funds available to the 
Mississippi River and Tributaries project.

                   operation and maintenance, general

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,697,015,000 for 
Operation and Maintenance, General, instead of $1,701,180,000 
as proposed by the House and $1,688,358,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conferees are concerned about the Administration's 
plans to stop requesting funds for the maintenance of a smaller 
navigation projects beginning in fiscal year 1998. Failure to 
adequately maintain those projects will cause economic hardship 
for many communities throughout the nation and result in 
hazardous navigation conditions that could directly lead to the 
loss of life and property. The conferees expect the 
Administration to continue to request adequate funds for 
maintenance of these projects.
      The conferees direct the Corps of Engineers to use funds 
appropriated in this Act to conduct and continue their 
participation in the comprehensive water resources study of the 
Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint 
River Basins with the states of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, 
as specified in the Memorandum of Agreement dated January 3, 
1992, as supplemental or amended, between the parties (the 
states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Army Corps of 
Engineers), through December 31, 1997 or the completion of the 
Comprehensive Study. Further funding contributions made by the 
states up to and including fiscal year 1996 will be considered 
in any additional funding requirement for contract studies or 
elements thereof.
      The conferees have provided an additional $550,000 for 
the Corps of Engineers to continue repairs to the damaged east 
and west jetties and to construct a concrete cap on the east 
jetty at Newport Bay Harbor in California.
      The Secretary of the Army is encouraged to conduct a 
study assessment and report to the Congress no later than one 
year from the date of enactment of this Act on the need and 
suitability to modify the Local Cooperation Agreement under 
which the Port of Santa Cruz now performs the Federal 
operations and maintenance mission at Santa Cruz Harbor in 
California. The study will particularly examine the need for an 
inflationary and cost of living increase adjustment that was 
not specified in the original agreement.
      Of the funds provided for the Sepulveda Dam, California, 
project, it is the conferees' intent that a significant portion 
shall be used for environmental restoration and wildlife 
habitat.
      The conference agreement includes $8,000,000 for the New 
York Harbor, New York project. The funds provided above the 
budget request are to be used to perform remaining dredged 
material management plan study activities and to implement 
short term disposal alternatives which have been determined to 
be feasible and quickly implementable and to investigate 
methods to reduce sediment contamination within the harbor.
      The conferees agree that the Corps of Engineers may use 
nontraditional means for erosion control on the Missouri River 
below the Fort Peck Dam in Montana to the North Dakota border.
      The conference agreement includes $7,552,000 for the 
Manteo (Shallowbag Bay), North Carolina, project to be used for 
additional maintenance dredging and monitoring of the terminal 
groin constructed at Oregon Inlet.
      The conference agreement includes language in the bill 
earmarking funds for the following projects in the amounts 
specified: Raystown Lake, Pennsylvania, $4,190,000; and Cooper 
Lake and Channels, Texas, $2,601,000.
      Language has been included in the bill which directs the 
Secretary of the Army to: use $1,000,000 of the funds provided 
in the bill to design and construct a landing at Guntersville, 
Alabama; design and implement an early flood warning system for 
the Greenbrier and Cheat River Basins in West Virginia; 
maintain a minimum conservation pool of 475.5 feet at Wister 
Lake in Oklahoma; and use $600,000 to perform maintenance 
dredging of the Cocheco River, New Hampshire, project. Language 
has also been included in the bill which provides that no funds 
available to the Corps of Engineers shall be used to acquire 
land in Jasper County, South Carolina, in connection with the 
Savannah Harbor navigation project.
      The conference agreement deletes language contained in 
Senate bill earmarking funds for the Compton Creek Channel, 
California, project and the Buford-Trenton Irrigation District 
erosion control project in North Dakota. Funding for these 
projects has been included in the overall amount appropriated 
for Operation and Maintenance, General.

                           Regulatory Program

      The conference agreement appropriates $101,000,000 for 
the Regulatory Program as proposed by the House and the Senate.
      The conferees agree that the Corps of Engineers should 
seek ways to implement the proposed administrative appeals 
process within the resources provided.

                 Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies

      The conference agreement appropriates $10,000,000 for 
Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies as proposed by the House 
and the Senate. In addition, the conference agreement includes 
language proposed by the House which directs the Secretary of 
the Army to use up to $8,000,000 of the funds appropriated in 
this Act and in Public Law 104-134 to rehabilitate non-Federal 
flood control levees along the Puyallup and Carbon Rivers in 
Pierce County, Washington.

                           Oil Spill Research

      The conference agreement provides no funds for the Oil 
Spill Research program.

                            General Expenses

      The conference agreement appropriates $149,000,000 for 
General Expenses instead of $145,000,000 as proposed by the 
House and $153,000,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement deletes language contained in 
the Senate bill which would have prohibited the Secretary of 
the Army from obligating funds for the closure of the Pacific 
Ocean Division.
      The conferees have, however, included language in the 
bill which directs the Secretary of the Army to begin 
implementing a plan to reduce the number of division offices to 
no more than eight and no less than six on April 1, 1997, and 
which provides authority for the Corps of Engineers to transfer 
up to $1,500,000 into this account from other accounts in this 
Title to investigate impacts in the delay in implementation of 
the division closure plan.

                           general provisions

                       corps of engineers--civil

      The conference agreement, in Section 101, includes 
language which provides that the Secretary of the Army, in 
fiscal year 1997, shall advertise for competitive bid at least 
8,500,000 cubic yards of the hopper dredge volumes accomplished 
with Government-owned dredges in fiscal year 1992 instead of 
10,000,000 cubic yards as proposed by the House and 7,500,000 
cubic yards as proposed by the Senate. During the period in 
which any of the Federal hopper dredges are placed in the 
reserve fleet or on standby status, or out of service for 
lengthy repair or rehabilitation, reallocating the entire 
8,500,000 cubic yards among the remaining Federal dredges would 
require further reduction in their days of service, thus making 
their operation more costly and less competitive. Therefore, if 
any of the Federal hopper dredges is removed from service for 
repair or rehabilitation or placed in the reserve fleet or on 
standby status and is prevented from accomplishing the level of 
work it has carried out during the past three fiscal years, the 
conferees direct the Corps of Engineers to reduce the 8,500,000 
cubic yards by the share allocated to that dredge over the past 
three fiscal years which has been put out for bid to the 
private sector.
      The conference agreement, in Section 102, includes 
language prohibiting the use of funds available to the Corps of 
Engineers to study, design, or undertake improvements or major 
repair to the hopper dredge McFarland, except for normal 
maintenance and repair necessary to maintain the vessel in its 
current operational condition. This language is identical to 
language contained in the fiscal year 1996 Energy and Water 
Development Appropriations Act. The House bill contained a 
similar provision, while the Senate bill did not address the 
issue.
      The conference agreement, in Section 103, includes 
language proposed by the Senate which modifies the 
authorization for the Moorfield, West Virginia, project by 
increasing the project's estimated cost.
      The conference agreement, in Section 104, includes 
language proposed by the Senate which modifies the 
authorization for the Grays Landing Lock and Dam, Monongahela 
River, Pennsylvania, project by increasing the project's 
estimated cost.
      The conference agreement, in Section 105, includes 
language proposed by the Senate which provides that flood 
control measures implemented under the authority of Section 
202(a) of Public Law 96-367 shall prevent future losses that 
would occur from a flood equal in magnitude to the flood of 
April 1977 or the 100-year frequency event, whichever is 
greater. The Senate language has been amended to clarify that 
it applies to nonstructural flood control measures.
      The conference agreement, in Section 106, includes 
language proposed by the Senate which will prevent the 
termination of contracts or the delay of scheduled work at 
specifically funded ongoing construction projects because of 
insufficient funding. When exercising this authority, the 
Secretary of the Army should be guided by the direction 
contained in the Senate report.
      The conference agreement, in Section 107, includes 
language proposed by the Senate directing the Corps of 
Engineers to complete the Charleston Riverfront (Haddad) Park, 
West Virginia, project.
      The conference agreement, in Section 108, includes 
language proposed by the Senate which modifies the 
authorization for the Arkansas City, Kansas, project by 
increasing the project's estimated cost with an amendment to 
reflect the current Federal and non-Federal costs.
      The conference agreement, in Section 109, includes 
language proposed by the Senate which provides that funds 
appropriated in the fiscal year 1993 Energy and Water 
Development Appropriations Act for the Elk Creek Dam, Oregon, 
project are available to plan and implement long term 
management measures at Elk Creek Dam to maintain the project in 
an uncompleted state and to take necessary steps to provide 
fish passage through the project.
      The conference agreement, in section 110, includes 
language authorizing and directing the Secretary of the Army to 
modify the Hudson River, New York, project, to provide for a 
300-foot wide channel to a depth of 24 feet from the existing 
Federal channel in the vicinity of Hudson City Light to the 
north dock at Union Street, Athens, New York.
      The conference agreement, in section 111, includes a 
provision amending language contained in the fiscal year 1996 
Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act regarding the 
conveyance of land to the City of Prestonsburg, Kentucky.
      The conference agreement, in section 112, includes 
language modifying the authorization for the project to perform 
emergency gate construction at Abiquiu Dam in New Mexico.

                                TITLE II

                       Department of the Interior

                central utah project completion account

      The conference agreement appropriate $43,627,000 to carry 
out the provisions of the Central Utah Project Completion Act 
as proposed by the House and the Senate.

                         bureau of reclamation

      The summary tables at the end of this title set forth the 
conference agreement with respect to the individual 
appropriations, programs, and activities of the Bureau of 
Reclamation. Additional items of conference agreement are 
discussed below.

                         general investigations

      The conference agreement appropriates $16,650,000 for 
General Investigations instead of $14,548,000 as proposed by 
the House and $18,105,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes $1,000,000 for the 
Bureau of Reclamation to undertake feasibility studies for 
water conservation projects in the Deschutes and Rogue River 
basins in Oregon.
      The conference agreement includes language in the bill 
providing $250,000 for the Del Norte County and Crescent City, 
California, Wastewater Reclamation project, and $250,000 for 
the Fort Bragg, California, Water Supply project.
      The conferees understand that the Bureau of Reclamation 
has been working cooperatively with interested parties in 
efforts to secure reliable and safe water supplies for the City 
and County of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The Bureau is to be 
commended and is encouraged to continue to provide assistance 
and work cooperatively with the City and County in the regional 
planning process to resolve critical issues associated with 
providing clean, reliable drinking water for the region.
      The conference agreement deletes language contained in 
the Senate bill earmarking funds for the Cheyenne River Sioux 
Reservation, South Dakota, study. Funding for this study is 
included in the overall amount provided for General 
Investigations.

                          construction program

      The conference agreement appropriates $394,056,000 for 
the Construction Program instead of $367,496,000 as proposed by 
the House and $398,596,700 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees have included $444,000 for the In-Situ 
Copper Mining Research Project, located near Casa Grande, 
Arizona, which has been transferred to the Bureau of 
Reclamation from the Bureau of Mines, for the continuation of 
the field test as proposed by the House. The funds are to be 
cost-shared by the private sector partner as provided for in 
the contract. It is the conferees' understanding that 
sufficient funds were transferred with the project to support 
Reclamation's in-house research and oversight responsibilities 
through the conclusion of the project. The Bureau of 
Reclamation should closely examine the research data to explore 
the application of the technology to other of its programs.
      The conference agreement includes $500,000, $250,000 
above the budget request, for the Bureau of Reclamation to 
undertake an environmental analysis and perform engineering for 
screening the Contra Costa Canal intake at Rock Slough in 
California.
      In lieu of the directive contained in the House report, 
the conferees direct the Bureau of Reclamation to provide 
private entities with a fair and reasonable opportunity to 
construct, rather than design and construct, new fish screen 
and fish recovery facilities associated with the Glenn-Colusa 
Irrigation District's Hamilton City Pumping Plant, with 
oversight responsibility by the Bureau of Reclamation in 
cooperation with the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District.
      The conferees have provided $1,100,000, the same as the 
level provided by the House, for work on alternative fish 
guidance systems and for new work on a positive barrier screen 
at Reclamation District 108's Wilkins Slough pumping plant. Of 
the funds provided, $500,000 shall be allocated to work on 
alternative fish guidance systems.
      The conferees have provided an additional $2,500,000 for 
the Endangered Species Recovery Implementation program for a 
wetland restoration project to be carried out along the 
Williamson River in Klamath County, Oregon, pursuant to the 
Upper Klamath Basin Working Group. Within 30 days of enactment 
of this Act, these funds shall be transferred in their entirety 
to a nonprofit entity with expertise in fish and wildlife 
management, and with a memorandum of understanding with the 
Bureau of Reclamation, to hold in an interest-bearing account 
and disburse as appropriate to other entities to accomplish the 
project purposes. This project shall be carried out jointly 
between the private entity, the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, the Natural Resources Conservation 
Service of the Department of Agriculture, and non-Federal 
interests in the project area.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the House that directs the Bureau of Reclamation to complete, 
by the end of fiscal year 1997, the environmental impact 
statement being conducted on the proposed Tucson, Arizona, 
surface reservoir.
      The conference agreement deletes language contained in 
the Senate bill for the Mid-Dakota Rural Water System in South 
Dakota. Funding for this project has been provided within the 
overall amount appropriated for the Construction Program.
      The conference agreement includes language proposed by 
the Senate extending the authority for the Reclamation States 
Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1991, Public Law 102-250, 
through 1997. The bill also includes language proposed by the 
Senate increasing the cost ceiling for the Umatilla Basin 
project in Oregon.
      The conference agreement deletes funding proposed by the 
Senate for the McCall Wastewater Treatment facility in Idaho 
and the Devils Lake, North Dakota, Desalination project.
      The conference agreement includes $58,740,000 for the 
Central Arizona Project instead of $51,155,000 as proposed by 
the House and $58,325,700 as proposed by the Senate. The 
specific items which comprise the total reduction of 
$12,988,000 are as follows: Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct, Siphon 
Repairs, Noncontract Costs--$1,616,000; Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct, 
Other Repairs, Noncontract Costs--$1,509,000; Other Project 
Costs, Water Allocations, Noncontract Costs--$500,000; Other 
Project Costs, Curation Facilities, O&M During Construction--
$350,000; Other Project Costs, Curation Facilities, Noncontract 
Costs--$400,000; Other Project Costs, Native Fish Protection, 
Major Contracts--$2,775,000; Other Project Costs, Native Fish 
Protection, Noncontract Costs--$332,000; Other Project Costs, 
Environmental Enhancement, Major Contracts--$900,000; Other 
Project Costs, Environmental Enhancement, Noncontract Costs--
$801,000; New Wadell Dam, Recreation Facilities--$1,550,000; 
and New Wadell Dam, Noncontract Costs--$2,255,000. The amount 
provided for the Central Arizona Project includes $200,000 for 
the Sierra Vista effluent recharge project and $1,470,000 for 
the Roadrunner Campground at New Wadell Dam.
      The conference agreement includes $225,000 each for the 
Spring Run Salmon and Coho Salmon programs as proposed by the 
House. The conferees expect that the funds deposited with the 
National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for these programs shall 
be subject to the same process, including matching requirements 
and competitive selection, as are other grants administered by 
the Foundation. The conferees emphasize the desire to build 
partnerships between diverse communities, leverage the use of 
taxpayer funds and maximize the value of projects selected for 
funding. The Foundation shall continue to have authority to 
select projects for funding through this program in order to 
realize the greatest fish and wildlife benefits.

                       OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE

      The conference agreement appropriates $267,876,000 for 
Operation and Maintenance instead of $286,232,000 as proposed 
by the House and $280,876,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees are aware that the Bureau of Reclamation 
and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) have been 
negotiating an agreement under which BPA will provide direct 
funding for the annual operations and maintenance costs 
associated with Reclamation's hydropower generation facilities 
in the Pacific Northwest. This approach would replace the 
existing procedure under which Reclamation requests annual 
appropriations to cover those costs with BPA providing 
reimbursement to the Treasury. The conferees believe the 
agreement should provide greater assurance of an appropriate 
level of funding for maintenance of power facilities thereby 
reducing the frequency of costly overhauls and increasing the 
reliability of BPA's power supply. The funding level for 
Reclamation's operation and maintenance program contained in 
the conference agreement assumes that direct funding by BPA 
will be implemented beginning in fiscal year 1997.
      The conferees direct the Bureau of Reclamation to carry 
out the items of work described in the House and Senate 
reports.

               BUREAU OF RECLAMATION LOAN PROGRAM ACCOUNT

      The conference agreement appropriates $12,715,000 for the 
Bureau of Reclamation Loan Program Account as proposed by the 
House and the Senate.

                CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT RESTORATION FUND

      Funding for the Contra Costa Canal Rock Slough fish 
screen project is contained within the amounts appropriated 
under the Construction Program.

                    GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      The conference agreement appropriates $46,000,000 for 
General Administrative Expenses instead of $45,150,000 as 
proposed by the House and $48,307,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The bill includes appropriations to continue work of the 
Western Water Policy Review Advisory Commission authorized 
under Public Law 102-575, Title 30, Western Water Policy Review 
Act. A question has arisen regarding the authority of the 
Commission to hire temporary staff from outside of the Federal 
government. It is not the intent of Congress in Section 3007 
(c)(1) of the subject Act to require the Commission to obtain 
permission from the Secretary of the Interior for each 
temporary position to be filled. This section is included only 
to advise the Commission of the desirability of utilizing 
Federal staff where they can be made available to the 
Commission at no cost. However, given the special needs of the 
Commission for independent analysis of Federal programs, and 
the very abbreviated time frame for their work, it is 
recognized that the Commission must be able to fill temporary 
positions where necessary with persons from outside of the 
Federal government.

                               TITLE III

                          Department of Energy

      The summary tables at the end of this title set forth the 
conference agreement with respect to the individual 
appropriations, programs, and activities of the Department of 
Energy. Additional items of conference agreements are discussed 
below.

                             reprogrammings

      The conference agreement does not provide the Department 
of Energy with any internal reprogramming flexibility in fiscal 
year 1997 unless specifically identified in the House, Senate, 
or conference reports. Any reallocations of new or prior year 
budget authority or prior year deobligations must be submitted 
to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in advance in 
writing and may not be implemented prior to approval by the 
Committees. This action has been taken as a result of liberal 
use of this authority by the Department to fund activities 
which were neither presented to nor approved by Congress. The 
Committees will review the need for this authority as part of 
the fiscal year 1998 appropriations process.

 use of receipts from leasing or selling government property or assets

      The conferees expect the receipts from either the lease 
or sale of government assets, less the costs directly related 
to the lease or sale, to be remitted to the United States 
Treasury unless specific authority is contained in the 
Appropriations Act permitting the Department to retain these 
receipts to offset funding requirements.
      The Department should perform a comprehensive review of 
current government assets which may be available for lease or 
sale and the potential revenues available from such sources, 
and be prepared to discuss this issue and the need for 
additional legislation during the fiscal year 1998 
appropriations process.

                       program direction accounts

      The conferees expect the Department to adhere to the 
funding levels provided for each program direction account in 
fiscal year 1997. If any funds other than the unobligated 
balances available for these specific activities at the end of 
fiscal year 1996 are to be used, the Department is expected to 
submit a reprogramming to Congress. This requirement pertains 
to the use of any prior year deobligations or any other reserve 
or other program accounts which may be used to augment the 
program direction funding.

general reductions necessary to accommodate specific program directions

      In the event that specific program guidance contained in 
the House, Senate, or conference reports requires a general 
reduction of available funding, such reductions shall not be 
applied disproportionately against any program, project, or 
activity.

           energy Supply, Research and Development Activities

      The conference agreement appropriates $2,710,908,000 for 
Energy Supply, Research and Development Activities instead of 
$2,668,573,000 as proposed by the House and $2,764,043,000 as 
proposed by the Senate. The agreement deletes language proposed 
by the House directing that $1,440,000 be made available for 
FTE reductions, and deletes language proposed by the Senate 
providing $5,000,000 for research of converting saline water to 
fresh water.

                  solar and renewable energy programs

      Funding of $29,000,000 is provided for the wind energy 
program, of which $2,000,000 shall be for the Kotzebue, Alaska 
project.
      Funding of $55,300,000 for biofuels energy systems is 
equally divided between two distinct programs, the power 
systems program and the transportation program. The $27,650,000 
provided for the power systems program includes the budget 
request amount to complete demonstration of the hot-gas 
filtration system at the gasifier in Hawaii. This year's 
funding is the final year of funding for this project. The 
power systems program also includes funding for the gasifier in 
Burlington, Vermont, and $4,000,000 for the biomass 
cogeneration turbine development program, $1,000,000 less than 
the amount requested. The transportation program includes 
$3,000,000 for the cost-shared biomass ethanol plant in 
Gridley, California, and $1,000,000 for testing forest residue 
feedstocks at the Department's biomass ethanol user facility, 
with the remainder of the funds made available for biochemical 
conversion. The conferees direct that funding for the regional 
biomass program and the feedstock program be allocated equally 
between the power systems and transportation programs.
      Funding of $750,000 for the solar international program 
is to be allocated to nongovernmental organizations which are 
active in joint implementation activities to develop specific 
international energy projects. The conferees direct that any 
carryover funds available on October 1, 1996 in the solar 
international and solar transfer programs be used only to honor 
existing contracts. Carryover funds from these two programs are 
not to be available for obligation for new contracts or 
agreements.
      Funding of $30,000,000 is provided for the geothermal 
program, including $300,000 for the Geo-Heat Center at the 
University of Oregon Institute of Technology and $2,000,000 for 
the Geysers geothermal project, which represents the final 
Federal contribution to this program.
      Funding of $1,000,000 is provided for hydropower for the 
cost-shared fish-friendly turbine research and development 
program.
      Funding of $4,000,000 is provided for renewable Indian 
energy resources, including $1,000,000 for the final Federal 
share of the Haida Alaska Native Village Corporation's Reynolds 
Creek hydroelectric project, $2,000,000 for the Eyak Native 
Corporation's Power Creek hydroelectric project and $1,000,000 
for the Klawock-Thorne Bay-Kasaan electrical intertie.
      Due to severe budget constraints, the conferees have not 
included the Senate language encouraging the Department to 
start a new program developing metal matrix composites.
      The conference agreement does not direct a specific 
reduction in the number of federal employees at Headquarters.

                             nuclear energy

      The conferees have provided $38,000,000 for the light 
water reactor program, $2,000,000 less than the budget request 
and the Senate amount. This is the final Federal contribution 
to the light water reactor program. The conferees have not 
included funding to demonstrate or study annealment of reactor 
cores.
      The conferees note that there is insufficient funding to 
support a viable nuclear engineering and radiation science 
research program. This program is underfunded to the point 
where the viability of the nuclear engineering academic 
departments in the United States, and the nuclear science 
capability of the nation, are at risk. The health and vitality 
of the academic infrastructure in nuclear science and 
engineering in the U.S. depends on an adequately funded 
research program. Therefore, the conferees urge the Department 
to include sufficient funding to reinstate the Nuclear 
Engineering Education Research program in the fiscal year 1998 
budget request.
      The conference agreement includes $12,704,000 for the 
isotope support program including $5,000,000 to implement the 
Department's record of decision on the production of 
molybdenum-99.

                     environment, safety and health

      The Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) is a 
private foundation co-funded by the governments of the United 
States and Japan to study the effects of radiation on the 
survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. The conferees 
agree that this program is a defense-related activity and have 
included the fiscal year 1997 funding of $15,000,000 in the 
environment, safety and health program under Other Defense 
Activities.

                            energy research

Biological and environmental research
      The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 for the 
final phase of the Biomedical Information Communication Center 
at the Oregon Health Sciences University. The database 
resulting from the project will be used to track the efficacy 
and effect of medical treatments, and assist in research 
efforts associated with the long-term effects of low-level 
exposure to potential environmental hazards such as radiation 
or electromagnetic fields. The conference agreement also 
includes $3,000,000 for the Indiana University School of 
Medicine. The University is nationally renowned for its 
achievements in the field of nuclear medicine. This 
contribution will allow the university to expand its efforts in 
the research and treatment of cancer, AIDS and other life-
threatening diseases.
      Within available funds, $1,000,000 is provided to 
establish a collaborative Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) 
program utilizing the nuclear radiation capabilities at the 
McClellan Nuclear Radiation Center (MNRC). This program will 
help establish the efficacy of BNCT for the treatment of 
inoperable brain tumors and will expand to include other 
difficult-to-treat malignancies such as melanoma, skull-base 
tumors, inherently radio-resistant tumors, long-bone sarcoma in 
children and pediatric brain tumors.
Fusion
      The conferees have provided $232,500,000 for the fusion 
energy program, an increase of $7,500,000 over the House 
recommendation. The conferees support the House and Senate 
inclusion of program direction and computational support within 
the amount provided for the fusion program. The conferees 
encourage the Department to reduce the amount identified for 
program direction, but do not stipulate amounts for program 
direction or computational support. To further provide maximum 
flexibility, the conferees have not included the prescriptive 
language included in the House report.
      The conferees have provided funds to continue and 
complete operations and provide for safe shutdown of the TFTR 
in fiscal year 1997. This is the final year of funding for 
fusion operations at the TFTR.
      The conference agreement includes funding to continue the 
U.S. participation in the engineering design activities phase 
of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) 
project, to which the United States is committed through fiscal 
year 1998.
Basic energy sciences
      Funding of $7,000,000 is provided for the Experimental 
Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program. 
Also, the conference agreement provides $3,200,000, for the 
Midwest Superconductivity Consortium. The conferees support 
collaborative multi-institution, multi-discipline materials 
research efforts involving ion exchange membranes, ion exchange 
resins, and solidification-stabilization for immobilization of 
hazardous wastes. The conferees are aware of an industrial 
multi-institutional consortium in the southeast which is 
exploring research in these applications and encourages the 
Department to determine whether there is a Departmental 
interest in joining this consortium.
      The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 for the 
University of Alabama. Funding of $9,500,000 is provided to 
complete the Energy, Minerals, and Materials Research Center 
which focuses on fundamental research in state-of-the-art 
manufacturing technologies related to energy efficiency and 
conservation, environmentally responsible production techniques 
and advanced information systems at the University of Alabama-
Tuscaloosa. The remaining $500,000 is provided to the 
University of Alabama-Birmingham in support of a cooperative 
research agreement to use magnetic resonance imaging systems to 
develop advanced cardiovascular imaging applications. The 
conference agreement also includes $7,000,000 for the Center 
for Technological Research with Industry at Rose-Hulman 
Institute of Technology. This project will complement the 
school's ongoing efforts to increase our nation's 
competitiveness by coordinating technology-based research with 
industrial and governmental sponsors.
Other energy research activities
      The conference agreement includes $10,000,000 for the 
establishment of the energy and environmental technology 
applications project at the University of Southwestern 
Louisiana. The project will enhance fundamental automation 
research in areas designed to improve the nation's global 
competitiveness and energy efficiency.
      The conferees have included the House recommendation for 
program direction, $30,600,000, but do not agree with the House 
direction that $2,500,000 be available for expenses related to 
workforce reduction. The conferees have not recommended a 
specific amount for the technology transfer program.

                       energy support activities

      The conferees agree with the House recommendation that 
funding for University and Science Education programs be 
provided from the sponsoring programs in the Department. The 
Department of Energy spends well over $100,000,000 throughout 
its programs to support science and education activities. To 
the extent such activities benefit and are a byproduct of the 
line programs, those programs should, within available funds, 
be the educational sponsor.

                       in-house energy management

      Last year, Congress eliminated the In-House Energy 
Management program as a stand-alone program. Notwithstanding 
this direction, the Department defied the clear intent of 
Congress and continued the program by using other available 
Departmental resources. The conferees encourage the Department 
to continue to carry out energy conservation activities, but do 
not support the resurrection of a separate program which was 
eliminated last year. To the extent the Department has not 
already done so, the conferees recommend that the Department 
conform its procurement regulations to the procurement 
authorities provided by subsections (a) and (c) of section 546 
of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 
8256). The conferees expect the Department to set an example 
and continue to lead the Federal Government in the procurement 
of energy saving devices and services.

      environmental restoration and waste management (non-defense)

      The conferees agree with the House report language on the 
Wayne, New Jersey project.
      The university robotics program is funded in the Defense 
Environmental Restoration and Waste Management program.

                uranium supply and enrichment activities

      The conference agreement appropriates net funding of 
$1,000,000 instead of $11,772,000 as proposed by the House and 
no funding as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement includes bill language proposed 
by the Senate which would permit security guards to carry side 
arms at the gaseous diffusion plants.
      The conference agreement retains bill language proposed 
by the Senate providing for payment by the United States 
Enrichment Corporation of necessary employee and agency 
contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund.
      The conferees agree to provide up to $10,000,000 of 
program funds for transparency measures.

      uranium enrichment decontamination and decommissioning fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $200,200,000 as 
proposed by the House instead of $205,200,000 as proposed by 
the Senate. The conference agreement retains language proposed 
by the House providing $34,000,000 for the uranium and thorium 
reimbursement program.

                general science and research activities

      The conference agreement appropriates $996,000,000 for 
General Science and Research Activities as proposed by the 
House instead of $1,000,626,000 as proposed by the Senate.

                      nuclear waste disposal fund

      The conference agreement appropriates $182,000,000 as 
proposed by the House instead of $200,028,000 as proposed by 
the Senate and deletes language proposed by the House making 
the appropriation subject to authorization. The conference 
agreement includes language proposed by the House prohibiting 
distribution of funds appropriated under this heading for the 
State of Nevada or affected units of local government. The 
agreement also includes language proposed by the Senate 
requiring the Secretary to prepare a viability assessment of 
the Yucca Mountain site, amended to impose a deadline of 
September 30, 1998 instead of June 30, 1998 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      The conferees direct that the appropriated funds be used 
in accordance with the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management 
Draft Program plan issued by the Department in May 1996 and for 
interim storage activities as authorized by law.

                      departmental administration

      The conference agreement appropriates $215,021,000 for 
Departmental Administration instead of $194,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $218,017,000 as proposed by the Senate. 
Revenues of $125,388,000 are estimated to be received in fiscal 
year 1997, resulting in a net appropriation of $89,633,000. The 
proposed funding level includes $6,000,000 available only for 
severance, termination, and related costs resulting from the 
reduction in personnel in Departmental Administration. The 
conference agreement includes $2,000,000 in environmental 
policy studies for the Department to continue analytic global 
climate change studies.
      The conference agreement deletes bill language proposed 
by the House specifying end-of-year employment levels by 
organization in the Department of Energy. However, the 
conferees are cognizant of these proposed employment levels and 
strongly urge the Department to use these as a guideline for 
proportionate reductions in fiscal year 1997.
      The conference agreement deletes language proposed by the 
Senate to provide voluntary separation incentives for the 
Department of Energy and to require payment by the Department 
of Energy to the Office of Personnel Management.

                    office of the inspector general

      The conference agreement appropriates $23,853,000 instead 
of $25,000,000 as proposed by the House and $23,103,000 as 
proposed by the Senate.
      The conferees agree that the current case load of the 
Office of Contractor Employee Protection does not support a 
separate office of the current size, and direct the Inspector 
General to assume the responsibility for these activities.

                    atomic energy defense activities

Weapons activities
      The conference agreement appropriates $3,911,198,000 
instead of $3,684,378,000 as proposed by the House and 
$3,988,602,000 as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement supports the direction provided 
in the Senate report for the stockpile stewardship program with 
the following adjustments. An increase of $30,000,000 over the 
budget request is provided for the accelerated strategic 
computing initiative. An additional $10,000,000 over the budget 
request has been provided for the technology transfer program; 
within this program up to $10,000,000 should be allocated for 
the American Textile Partnership (AMTEX), and up to $10,000,000 
should be allocated for the Advanced Computational and 
Technology Initiative (ACTI). The conference agreement provides 
specific funding levels identified by the House and Senate for 
the University of Rochester and the Naval Research Laboratory 
in the inertial confinement fusion program.
      For core stockpile management, the conference agreement 
provides $1,834,470,000. Funding of $150,000,000 is provided 
for a new tritium source, instead of $100,000,000 as proposed 
by the House and $160,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. The 
conferees direct the Department to notify the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations prior to initiating in-reactor 
tests of tritium target rods at a commercial light water 
reactor. Enhanced surveillance activities are increased by 
$15,000,000; advanced manufacturing activities are increased by 
$80,000,000; and $6,000,000 is included for upgrades for the 
tritium recycling facility.
      For program direction funding, the conference agreement 
provides $325,000,000 which includes $22,600,000 for the final 
settlement payment for the community assistance program at Los 
Alamos, New Mexico. The funding provided is $31,404,000 less 
than the budget request for salaries and other expenses, and 
the conferees agree that these reductions should be taken 
proportionately as recommended in the House report.

         defense environmental restoration and waste management

      The conference agreement appropriates $5,459,304,000 for 
Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management instead 
of $5,409,310,000 as proposed by the House and $5,605,210,000 
as proposed by the Senate.
      The conference agreement deletes language included by the 
Senate earmarking $2,000,000 for demonstration of stir-melter 
technology and $5,000,000 for the electrometallurgical 
treatment of spent nuclear fuel.
      The conferees have provided $15,000,000 for ``Closure 
Projects,'' a new initiative to accelerate the closure of 
facilities or significantly reduce outyear mortgage costs. The 
conferees direct the Department to include funding at an 
appropriate level for this activity as part of the fiscal year 
1998 budget request.
      The conference agreement provides $1,762,194,000 for 
environmental restoration, the same as the budget request.
      Within the waste management program, up to $2,000,000 is 
provided for demonstration of stir-melter technology developed 
by the Department and previously intended to be used at the 
Savannah River Site. The Department is directed to seek 
alternative use of this technology to maximize the investment 
already made in this technology.
      The conferees encourage the Department to support 
planning and concepts refinement for a Systems Approach to 
Precision Farming and Technology Integration consistent with 
the 1995 Department of Energy/U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Memorandum of Understanding.
      The conference agreement provides the budget request for 
site operations activities which were transferred to the 
nuclear materials and facility stabilization program. This 
includes the training and transportation budget requests which 
were reduced by the House.
      The conferees also direct the Department to provide 
$2,000,000 from the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste 
Management account, through the Department's Memorandum of 
Understanding with the Department of Health and Human Services, 
for the Hanford Thyroid study.
      Within the budget request for robotics in the technology 
development program, $4,000,000 is provided for the university 
robotics program as proposed by the House.
      The conferees are pleased with the progress to date in 
implementing the environmental basic research program. In a 
recent review by the National Research Council, the Council 
endorsed this program and acknowledged, ``* * * establishment 
of this mission-directed, basic research program as both an 
urgent and a prudent investment for the nation.'' The National 
Research Council report further notes that the, ``* * * long-
term success of this program is highly dependent on the 
continuing partnership between EM, which understands the 
cleanup problems and research needs, and ER, which, through its 
mission to manage the department's basic research programs, 
understands how to select and manage research. The committee 
endorses the efforts made by EM and ER staff to work together 
and encourages them to continue their efforts to build an 
effective Environmental Management Science Program.''
      Due to budget constraints, the conference agreement 
provides $170,000,000 for the environmental privatization 
program at Richland, Washington. The conferees note with much 
interest the recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report 
on the Hanford high-level waste tank remediation program. The 
conferees agree with the NAS statement that, ``* * * a time 
during which funding is constrained is precisely the wrong time 
to drop work on alternatives that might achieve satisfactory 
results at a significantly lower cost.'' The NAS report notes 
that developing such backup technologies ``* * * would still 
allow remediation to proceed expeditiously.'' The conferees 
therefore recommend allocating up to $15,000,000 for technology 
development of such alternatives. An example of such 
alternatives brought to the attention of the Committees is a 
recent industry proposal to develop small, modular inductive 
in-can vitrification and in-tank processing as high-payoff 
backup technologies.
      The conferees have provided $411,511,000 for the program 
direction account, a reduction of $35,000,000 from the budget 
request. The number of Headquarters Federal employees are to be 
reduced, and travel expenses and advisory and assistance 
services at Headquarters and the field are to be reduced. The 
conferees are very concerned with the Department's current plan 
to reduce employees at Headquarters by transferring them to the 
field. Any attempt to move employees to field offices without 
sufficient justification and a demonstrated critical need in 
the field will not be supported by Congress. Funding for 
environmental cleanup programs will continue to be constrained 
next year, and the Department must ensure that it is not just 
moving the problem to another year and another location.
      The conference agreement maintains the current policy 
that no cleanup funds are to be used for economic development 
activities. The conferees have provided $62,000,000 in the 
worker and community transition program which was established 
and authorized to fund such activities, and expect all economic 
development activities to be funded from that program.
      The conferees note with concern the tendency of the FY 
1997 defense authorization Act to disregard an equitable 
allocation of funds added above the budget request in the 
Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management account. 
Therefore, the conferees encourage the Department to prioritize 
those programs and activities which would benefit from these 
additional funds and submit a reprogramming request necessary 
to implement such programs and activities which the Department 
deems a priority for the Defense Environmental Management 
mission.
Hanford Tank Farms privatization
      The conferees support statements in the House report that 
steps should be taken to minimize any negative budgetary impact 
on current cleanup activities at Hanford resulting from the 
creation of a privatization fund for the Hanford Tank Waste 
Remediation System program. The Department has also advised the 
conferees that this privatization fund does not take monies 
away from the Hanford cleanup operating budget for FY 1997. 
Despite these assurances, however, concerns persist that the 
privatization fund will result in further funding cuts to 
Hanford's operating budget and accompanying job losses at the 
site. In response to these concerns, the conferees state their 
agreement with the Department that the specific establishment 
of the privatization fund will not directly cause additional 
delays in cleanup schedules or layoffs at Hanford in FY 1997.
      Furthermore, the conferees strongly encourage the 
Department, to the maximum extent possible, to allocate savings 
that result from the new management contract at Hanford and any 
prior year balances to the privatization program for the 
treatment of high and low level waste at the Hanford site.

                        fixed asset acquisition

      The conference agreement provides $160,000,000 for this 
activity, instead of $134,500,000 as proposed by the House and 
$182,000,000 as proposed by the Senate. This funding is 
included in the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste 
Management appropriation account.

                        Other Defense Activities

      The conference agreement appropriates $1,605,733,000 for 
Other Defense Activities instead of $1,459,533,000 as proposed 
by the House and $1,606,833,000 as proposed by the Senate. 
Details of the conference agreement are provided below.

                 Nonproliferation and National Security

      The conference agreement provides $634,472,000 for 
nonproliferation and national security instead of $564,272,000 
as proposed by the House and $649,872,000 as proposed by the 
Senate.
      In the nonproliferation and verification research and 
development program, the conferees have provided an additional 
$17,000,000 to the Department to undertake a research and 
development program to address the technical means for 
detecting the presence, transportation, production, and use of 
materials to make biological and chemical weapons.
      Within the funding for arms control, a total of 
$30,000,000 is for the Industrial Partnering Program, 
$7,900,000 is to complete the canning of spent nuclear fuel 
rods in North Korea, and an additional $20,000,000 over the 
budget request of $92,637,000 is provided for the materials 
protection, control, and accounting program.
      The conference agreement includes the Senate proposal for 
the intelligence program, and provides $88,122,000 for the 
program direction account.

                Environment, Safety and Health (Defense)

      The conference agreement provides $78,800,000, an 
increase of $15,000,000 over the budget request, for defense-
related environment, safety and health activities. The 
conferees have recommended funding the budget request of 
$15,000,000 for the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in 
fiscal year 1997 in this account. The Foundation had previously 
been funded in the environment, safety and health (nondefense) 
account.

                    Worker and community transition

      The conference agreement provides $62,000,000 for the 
worker and community transition program instead of $57,000,000 
as provided by the House and $67,000,000 as provided by the 
Senate.

                        Nuclear energy (defense)

      The conference agreement provides $45,000,000 for the 
international nuclear safety program to improve the safety of 
Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. The conferees have provided 
$3,500,000 for preparatory work for converting the fuel in 
three Russian production reactors so that they do not produce 
weapons-grade plutonium while providing heat and electricity.

                     Fissile Materials Disposition

      The conference agreement provides $103,796,000 for 
fissile materials disposition, an increase of $10,000,000 over 
the budget request. As proposed by the Senate, the additional 
funding will permit the Department to undertake a cooperative 
technology effort on the verifiable dismantlement and 
conversion of plutonium from former Soviet Union weapons. This 
effort will use new ARIES technology to transform weapons grade 
plutonium removed from Russian weapons into plutonium oxide or 
hydride which is unsuitable for weapons.

                             Naval Reactors

      The conference agreement provides $681,932,000, as 
proposed by the House, instead of $663,932,000 as proposed by 
the Senate. The additional $18,000,000 over the budget request 
will be used to continue test reactor inactivation efforts.

                    Power Marketing Administrations

Alaska Power Marketing Administration
      The conference agreement appropriates $4,000,000, as 
proposed by the House and the Senate.
Bonneville Power Administration
      A total of $3,750,000,000 has been made available to 
Bonneville as permanent borrowing authority. For fiscal year 
1997, the conferees recommend $277,000,000 in new borrowing 
authority, a reduction of $10,000,000 from the budget request. 
During fiscal year 1997, Bonneville plans to repay the Treasury 
$835,000,000, of which $278,000,000 is to repay principal on 
the Federal investment in these facilities. The conferees agree 
that no new direct loans may be made in fiscal year 1997. The 
conferees agree with the Senate report language pertaining to 
fish and wildlife agreements and mid-Columbia hydroelectric 
plants. While the conferees recognize Bonneville's need to 
remain competitive and assure its payments to the Treasury, 
Bonneville should make every effort to fulfill the commitments 
it has made to renewable energy and energy conservation 
resources.
      The conferees have agreed to retain the voluntary 
separation incentive language provided in fiscal year 1996, but 
have agreed to limit the authority to September 30, 2000.
            BPA energy services business
      The changes occurring in the electric utility industry 
are expected to result in changes to the authorities and 
responsibilities of the Bonneville Power Administration. The 
conferees support the efforts of the Governors, through 
establishment of the Regional Review, to develop consensus 
recommendations for restructuring Bonneville. The conferees 
have heard legitimate concerns expressed about Bonneville's 
formation of an energy services business. While the conferees 
are not eliminating funding for this venture, it should only be 
continued in the context of the historic energy efficiency 
services Bonneville has offered to its existing customers.
      The conferees have agreed to limit Bonneville's borrowing 
authority to $10 million for their energy services business 
line, a decrease of $10 million from Bonneville's request. 
Including this amount should not be viewed as an endorsement by 
the conferees of Bonneville's ESB activities. Bonneville should 
limit its activities to the continuation of historic services 
to existing customers, including new contracts with existing 
customers, not to cumulatively exceed $3 million until the 
Regional Review has determined the appropriateness of the 
activities and developed clear parameters. If the Regional 
Review or ultimately Congressional action does not support 
Bonneville's proposed new venture, Bonneville should not expand 
its activities into this area. When entering into these 
contracts with existing customers, such contracts shall provide 
full cost recovery. The parameters developed by the Regional 
Review should address the appropriate level of capitalization, 
competitive implications and maintenance of a competitive 
energy services market, and minimize the risk of cross-
subsidies from BPA's core power marketing and transmission 
customers. The conferees expect Bonneville to act consistent 
with the recommendations made by the Regional Review.
      The conferees share the concern of the House report that 
Bonneville's activities in this area may compete with the 
private sector. Bonneville shall work with representatives of 
the energy services industry in the Northwest to reach 
agreement on principles which assure that Bonneville's 
activities are structured to enlarge the energy services market 
and do not compete with work that the private sector could 
reasonably perform. The conferees understand that, with the 
exception of Federal agencies, Bonneville has committed to 
doing virtually no work with retail consumers without the 
support of the local utility and the conferees expect 
Bonneville to carry out this commitment.
      The Northwest Power Planning Council shall prepare a 
report on Bonneville's implementation of the Regional Review

                                TITLE V

                           General Provisions

      Sec. 501.--The conference agreement includes language 
proposed by the House and Senate regarding the purchase of 
American-made equipment and products, and language proposed by 
the House prohibiting contracts with persons falsely labeling 
products as made in America.
      Sec. 502.--The conference agreement includes language 
proposed by the House repealing 42 U.S.C. 7262 which provides 
authority to the Secretary of Energy to accept gifts, bequests, 
and devises of money.
      Sec. 503.--The conference agreement includes language 
proposed by the House which provides that none of the funds 
made available by this Act may be used to determined the final 
point of discharge for the interceptor drain for San Luis Unit 
of the Central Valley Project until development by the 
Secretary of the Interior and the State of California of a 
plan, which shall conform to the water quality standards of the 
State of California as approved by the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, to minimize any detrimental 
effect of the San Luis drainage waters. The language also 
provides that the costs of the Kesterson Reservoir Cleanup 
Program and the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program shall be 
classified as reimbursable or nonreimbursable by the Secretary 
of the Interior as described in the Bureau of Reclamation 
report entitled, ``Repayment Report, Kesterson Reservoir 
Cleanup Program and San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program, 
February 1995'' and that any future obligation of funds for 
drainage service or drainage studies for the San Luis Unit 
shall be fully reimbursable by San Luis Unit beneficiaries 
pursuant to Reclamation law.
      Sec. 504.--The conference agreement includes language 
proposed by the House which provides that none of the funds 
appropriated in this Act may be used to revise the Missouri 
River Master Water Control Manual if such revision provided for 
an increase in the springtime water release program during the

rivers draining into the Missouri River below the Gavins Point 
Dam.
      Sec. 505.--The conference agreement amends language 
proposed by the House repealing a provision included in the 
Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1991, which 
made bypass releases for temperature control purposes at the 
Shasta Dam nonreimbursable. The conferees have included this 
provision to make reimbursable any replacement power purchases 
necessitated by water releases for fishery purposes that must 
bypass the generators in Shasta Dam, and have made the 
provision effective upon operation of the Shasta temperature 
control device or September 30, 1997. The temperature control 
device construction should be completed early in fiscal year 
1997. The conferees anticipate that it will eliminate waste of 
electrical energy and the need for replacement power purchases, 
and urge the Bureau of Reclamation to achieve operation as soon 
as possible.
      Sec. 506.--The conference agreement includes language 
proposed by the Senate which extends the water service 
contracts for the Bostwick District (Kansas portion), and 
Bostwick District (Nebraska portion) projects for a period of

amended to make technical corrections.
      Sec. 507.--The conference agreement includes language 
proposed by the Senate requiring the Department of Energy to 
submit a monthly report on adherence to recommendations 
included in the reports accompanying this appropriations Act. 
The language has been modified to make this a one-time report, 
due on February 28, 1997. This report should describe the 
status and expected actions to be taken for each recommendation 
included in the House, Senate, or conference report.
      Sec. 508, 509, 510.--The conference agreement includes 
language proposed by the House denying funds to institutions of 
higher learning which prevent campus access to units of the 
Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps or Federal military 
recruiting on campus, amended to apply only to such subelements 
of affected institutions which prevent campus access. The 
language also prohibits the use of funds to enter into or renew 
contracts with entities failing to comply with statutory 
reporting requirements concerning the employment of certain 
veterans.
      Sec. 511.--The conference agreement deletes language 
proposed by the House repealing section 508(f) of the Energy 
and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1996, providing the 
Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration the 
authority to offer employees voluntary separation incentives up 
to $25,000. The voluntary separation incentive language is 
retained and modified to extend the buyout authority until 
September 30, 2000.
      Sec. 512.--The conference agreement modifies language 
proposed by the Senate regarding scientific review of the 
Bonneville Power Administration's fish and wildlife programs.
      The Managers believe that successful implementation of 
the Northwest Power Planning Council's (Council) fish and 
wildlife program would be benefited by the advice of 
independent scientists with expertise on the enhancement of 
Columbia River fish and wildlife. The Managers understand that 
the Council, together with the National Marine Fisheries 
Service, has established an ``Independent Scientific Advisory 
Board'' (ISAB) in order to provide scientific advice to the 
Council and NMFS on the Council's plan for fish and wildlife 
for the River system. The Managers have included language in 
its bill directing the National Academy of Sciences to submit a 
list of individuals to the Council to serve on an ``Independent 
Scientific Review Panel'' (Panel) to review projects for 
funding under BPA's annual fish and wildlife program. The 
Managers note that nothing in the bill language precludes NAS 
from recommending the same scientists that serve on the ISAB to 
serve on the newly created Independent Scientific Review Panel, 
provided that members meet the conflict of interest standards 
spelled out in the bill language. If ISAB scientists are 
selected to serve on the newly created Panel, such scientists 
should not be compensated twice for their services.
      The Managers understand that the Council has also 
developed multi-year work plans that are used to make decisions 
for fish and wildlife projects. The Managers note that nothing 
in the bill language prohibits the Panel and Peer Review Groups 
from reviewing such multi-year work plan proposals.
      BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget for the Council's 
program totals well over $100 million. Its purpose is to 
protect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife populations 
along the Columbia and Snake River system. The Managers 
recognize that the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Authority 
(CBFWA) is presently responsible for prioritizing Council 
program measures and making recommendations to the Council on 
projects to be funded through BPA's annual fish and wildlife 
budget. The Managers understand that each year roughly four 
hundred proposals are submitted for review by CBFWA in order to 
receive funding from BPA's annual budget. CBFWA's advice is 
important. CBFWA members, however, are also the Federal and 
State fish and wildlife agencies and the tribes who financially 
benefit from the program. The Managers believe that independent 
scientific review would remove any suggestion of conflict of 
interest in prioritizing programs, and add an important element 
of independent scientific review to the Council decision making 
process.
      The bill language seeks to ensure that Northwest 
ratepayer dollars are being spent in a cost effective and 
objective manner. The bill language requires that the Council 
establish, from a list submitted by NAS, Scientific Peer Review 
Groups to assist the Panel in making its recommendations to the 
Council. Projects shall be reviewed based upon the following 
criteria: projects benefit fish and wildlife in the region; 
have a clearly defined objective and outcome; and are based on 
sound science principles.
      After review of the projects by the Panel and Peer Review 
Groups, the Panel shall submit its recommendations on project 
priorities to the Council for consideration. The Council shall 
make the Panel's recommendations available to the public for 
review.
      The Council shall review recommendations of the Panel, 
the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Authority, and others, in 
making its final recommendations to BPA of projects to be 
funded through BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget. If the 
Council does not follow the advice of the Panel, it is to 
explain in writing the basis for its decision. The Managers 
understand that ocean conditions are a contributing factor to 
the health of fish and wildlife populations in the region, and 
have directed the Council to consider the impacts of ocean 
conditions in making its recommendations to BPA to fund 
projects. Bill language also directs the Council to determine 
whether project recommendations employ cost effective measures 
to achieve its objectives. The bill language expressly states 
the Council, after review of Panel and other recommendations, 
has the authority to make final recommendations to BPA on 
project(s) to be funded through BPA's annual fish and wildlife 
budget.
      The provision shall go into effect upon the date of 
enactment, and the Managers intend that the provision be used 
to start the planning process for the expenditure of BPA's FY98 
fish and wildlife budget. This provision shall expire on 
September 30, 2000.
      Sec. 513.--The conference agreement includes language 
renaming Cooper Lake in Texas as the ``Jim Chapman Lake.''
      Sec. 514.--The conference agreement includes language 
naming a dam on the Rogue River in Jackson County, Oregon, as 
the ``William L. Jess Dam and Intake Structure.''
      Sec. 515.--The conference agreement includes language 
designating a portion of the Red River in Louisiana as the ``J. 
Bennett Johnston Waterway.''

                     general provisions not adopted

      The conference agreement deletes language proposed by the 
House prohibiting the Tennessee Valley Authority from imposing 
a performance deposit in connection with permits issued for 
docks and other residential shoreline alterations.
      The conference agreement deletes language proposed by the 
Senate pertaining to the authority of the State of Oregon to 
enter into memorandum of understanding with the State of 
Washington to address issues regarding the Hanford Reservation.
      The conference agreement deletes language proposed by the 
Senate which gives the State of Oregon an opportunity to review 
and comment on certain remedial actions at the Hanford Nuclear 
Reservation in the State of Washington.
      The conference agreement deletes language contained in 
sections 507 and 508 of the Senate bill which would have 
deferred principal and interest payments for one year on the 
water service contracts for the Nueces River and Canadian River 
projects in Texas.
      The conference agreement deletes language proposed by the 
Senate, the text of S. 534, to provide authority for states to 
limit the interstate transportation of municipal solid waste 
and to provide for state and local government control of the 
movement of municipal solid waste and recyclable material.
      The conference agreement deletes language proposed by the 
Senate expressing the sense of the Senate regarding a United 
States semiconductor trade agreement with Japan.
