restore the provisions of chapter 76 of that title (relating to

                civilians who are subjects of the board's inquiry.'';

  (g) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect immediately after the enactment of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997.

                         Purpose and Background

    H.R. 4000 would restore provisions of Chapter 76 of title 
10, United States Code (relating to American prisoners of war 
and missing in action), that were in effect before amendment by 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 
(section 578 in House Report 104-724).
    Chapter 76 of title 10, United States Code, was created by 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 
(section 569 of Public Law 104-106). The principal purpose of 
the legislation was ``to ensure that any member of the Armed 
Forces (and any Department of Defense civilian employee or 
contractor employee who serves with or accompanies the Armed 
Forces in the field under orders) who becomes missing or 
unaccounted for is ultimately accounted for by the United 
States, and, as a general rule, is not declared dead solely 
because of the passage of time.''
    The President's legislative proposal fiscal year 1997 
sought the repeal or modification of nine major provisions of 
Chapter 76. The Senate adopted those repeals and modifications 
in its version of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 1997 (section 537 of S. 1745; see also Senate 
Report 104-267). The conference report on H.R. 3230, the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, 
incorporated the majority of changes made by the Senate. H.R. 
4000 would reinstate the provisions repealed or modified by the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997.

                          Legislative History

    H.R. 4000 was introduced on August 2, 1996, by 
Representative Robert K. Dornan and 264 cosponsors. The bill 
was referred to the Committee on National Security.
    On September 10, 1996, the Subcommittee on Military 
Personnel held a hearing on H.R. 4000 and heard testimony in 
support of the bill from Representatives Benjamin A. Gilman, 
Sam Johnson and Ron Packard, as well as from Michael D. Benge, 
former government civilian employee and Vietnam-era prisoner of 
war, Larry Stark, former U.S. Navy civilian contractor employee 
and Vietnam-era prisoner of war, Carol Hrdlicka, wife of Col. 
David Hrdlicka, USAF, Vietnam-era prisoner of war, Donna Downes 
Knox, legal counsel and member of the board of directors, 
Korean/Cold War Family Association of the Missing, and J. 
Thomas Burch, Jr., president, National Vietnam Veterans 
Coalition.
    On September 12, 1996, the Committee on National Security 
met to consider H.R. 4000. The committee agreed to an amendment 
in the nature of a substitute that would make minor technical 
changes to the introduced bill. H.R. 4000, as amended, was 
ordered reported favorably to the House by a vote of 45 to 0.

                  Summary of Committee Recommendations

    H.R. 4000, as amended by the House National Security 
Committee, would:
    Reapply Chapter 76 of title 10, United States Code, to 
Department of Defense civilians and contractors accompanying 
armed forces in the field. The conference agreement on H.R. 
3230, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
1997, would limit the scope of the law solely to military 
personnel;
    Reestablish a 48-hour time period within which a field 
commander's initial report of a missing person's status must be 
made. However, in the event of an emergency situation due to 
hostile action or combat, a commander could delay that initial 
report up to 10 days. The conference report on H.R. 3230 would 
establish a 10-day time frame for all such reports, regardless 
of operational circumstances;
    Restore the requirement for the theater component commander 
to review a field commander's initial assessment of a missing 
person's status and to assess the adequacy of actions being 
taken to resolve the missing person's status. The conference 
report on H.R. 3230 would eliminate the involvement of the 
theater component commander;
    Restore the requirement that the status of persons who were 
last known alive be reviewed every three years for 30 years 
following the initial report that such persons were missing. 
The conference report on H.R. 3230 would direct the appropriate 
service secretary to conduct a review only when new information 
that may change the missing person's status is received;
    Restore the authority to assess criminal penalties for the 
knowing and willful withholding of information from a missing 
person's file. The conference report on H.R. 3230 would 
eliminate this authority;
    Restore the requirement that a Department of Defense status 
review board (when making determinations of death) provide a 
description of the location of body, if recovered, and (if the 
body is unidentifiable), a certification by ``a practitioner of 
an appropriate forensic science that the body recovered is that 
of the missing person.'' The conference report on H.R. 3230 
would eliminate both these requirements; and
    Restore the authority to request a status review of Korean 
conflict cases involving a person who was killed in action, but 
whose body was not recovered, when new, ``compelling'' 
information is received. The conference report on H.R. 3230 
would eliminate this provision.

                           Committee Position

    On September 12, 1996, the Committee on National Security, 
a quorum being present, approved H.R. 4000, as amended, by a 
vote of 45 to 0.

                              Fiscal Data

    Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XIII of the Rules of the House 
of Representatives, the committee attempted to ascertain annual 
outlays resulting from the bill during fiscal year 1997 and the 
four following fiscal years. The results of such efforts are 
reflected in the cost estimate prepared by the Director of the 
Congressional Budget Office under section 403 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which is included in this 
report pursuant to clause 2(l)(3)(C) of House rule XI.

                  congressional budget office estimate

    In compliance with clause 2(l)(3)(C) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, the cost estimate 
prepared by the Congressional Budget Office and submitted 
pursuant to section 403(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974 is as follows:

               congressional budget office cost estimate

                                                September 16, 1996.
Hon. Floyd Spence,
Chairman, Committee on National Security,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 4000, as ordered reported by the House Committee 
on National Security on September 12, 1996. CBO estimates that 
enactment of the bill would not significantly affect the budget 
of the federal government.
    The bill would repeal provisions of H.R. 3230, the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, which has been 
cleared for the President's signature but has not yet been 
signed into law. Section 578 of H.R. 3230 would prohibit fines 
on persons who withhold information from the files of missing 
personnel of the Department of Defense (DoD) and would change 
DoD administrative procedures when military and civilian 
personnel are missing. H.R. 4000 would impose the fines and 
would overturn many other changes contained in section 578.
    Imposing criminal fines would cause governmental receipts 
to increase, but CBO estimates that any such increase would be 
less than $500,000 annually. These receipts would be deposited 
in the Crime Victims Trust Fund and would be spent in the 
following year; thus direct spending from the fund would match 
the increase in receipts from the fines with a one year lag. 
CBO estimates that the other provisions in H.R. 4000 would have 
no significant budgetary impact.
    H.R. 4000 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4) and would have no effect on the budgets of 
state, local, or tribal governments.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Kent 
Christensen.
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                        committee cost estimate

    Pursuant to clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the committee generally concurs with 
the estimate as contained in the report of the Congressional 
Budget Office.

                       inflation impact statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the committee concludes that the bill 
would have no significant inflationary impact.

                           Oversight Findings

    With respect to clause 2(l)(3)(A) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, this legislation results from 
hearings and other oversight activities conducted by the 
committee pursuant to clause 2(b)(1) of rule X.
    With respect to clause 2(l)(3)(B) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives and section 308(a)(1) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, this legislation does not 
include any new spending or credit authority, nor does it 
provide for any increase or decrease in tax revenues or 
expenditures. The fiscal features of this legislation are 
addressed in the estimate prepared by the Director of the 
Congressional Budget Office under section 403 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
    With respect to clause 2(l)(3)(D) of rule XI of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives, the committee has not received 
a report from the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight 
pertaining to the subject matter of H.R. 4000.

                     Statement of Federal Mandates

    Pursuant to section 423 of Public Law 104-4, this 
legislation contains no federal mandates with respect to state, 
local, and tribal governments, nor with respect to the private 
sector. Similarly, the bill would provide no unfunded federal 
intergovernmental mandates.

                             Rollcall Vote

    In accordance with clause 2(l)(2)(B) of rule XI of the 
Rules of the House of Representatives, a rollcall vote was 
taken with respect to the committee's consideration of H.R. 
4000. The record of this vote is attached to this report.
    The committee ordered H.R. 4000 reported to the House with 
a favorable recommendation by a vote of 45 to 0, a quorum being 
present.

         Changes in Existing Law Made by the Bill, as Reported

  In compliance with clause 3 of rule XIII of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the

report for that measure was agreed to by the House of 
Representatives on August 1, 1996, and by the Senate on 
September 10, 1996, but that measure had not been enacted as of 
the filing of this report.

  (a) Preliminary Assessment and Recommendation by Commander.--
(1) After receiving information that the whereabouts and status 
of a person described in section 1501(c) of this title is 
uncertain and that the absence of the person may be 
involuntary, the commander of the unit, facility, or area to or 
in which the person is assigned shall make a preliminary 
assessment of the circumstances. If, as a result of that 
assessment, the commander concludes that the person is missing, 
the commander shall--
          [(1)] (A) recommend that the person be placed in a 
        missing status; and
          [(2)] (B) not later than [10 days] 48 hours after 
        receiving such information, transmit a report 
        containing that recommendation to the [Secretary 
        concerned] theater component commander with 
        jurisdiction over the missing person in accordance with 
        procedures prescribed under section 1501(b) of this 
        title.
  (2) However, if the commander determines that operational 
conditions resulting from hostile action or combat constitute 
an emergency that prevents timely reporting under paragraph 
(1)(B), the initial report should be made as soon as possible, 
but in no case later than ten days after the date on which the 
commander receives such information under paragraph (1).
  (b) Transmission Through Theater Component Commander.--Upon 
reviewing a report under subsection (a) recommending that a 
person be placed in a missing status, the theater component 
commander shall ensure that all necessary actions are being 
taken, and all appropriate assets are being used, to resolve 
the status of the missing person. Not later than 14 days after 
receiving the report, the theater component commander shall 
forward the report to the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary 
concerned in accordance with procedures prescribed under 
section 1501(b) of this title. The theater component commander 
shall include with such report a certification that all 
necessary actions are being taken, and all appropriate assets 
are being used, to resolve the status of the missing person.
  [(b)] (c) Safeguarding and Forwarding of Records.--A 
commander making a preliminary assessment under subsection (a) 
with respect to a missing person shall (in accordance with 
procedures prescribed under section 1501 of this title) 
safeguard and forward for official use any information relating 
to the whereabouts and status of the missing person that 
results from the preliminary assessment or from actions taken 
to locate the person. The theater component commander through 
whom the report with respect to the missing person is 
transmitted under subsection (b) shall ensure that all 
pertinent information relating to the whereabouts and status of 
the missing person that results from the preliminary assessment 
or from actions taken to locate the person is properly 
safeguarded to avoid loss, damage, or modification.
