                October 1, 1996.--Ordered to be printed

_______________________________________________________________________


    Mr. Roth, from the Committee on Finance, submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 3815]

      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

     The Committee on Finance, to which was referred the bill 
(H.R. 3815) to make technical corrections and miscellaneous 
amendments to the trade laws, having considered the same, 
reports favorably thereon with an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute and recommends that the bill, as amended, do pass.

                             I. Background

    On June 7, 1996, Chairman Roth requested public comment on 
a package of 32 trade bills comprising various technical 
corrections, duty suspensions, and other miscellaneous trade 
measures introduced during the 104th Congress and referred to 
the Committee on Finance. H.R. 3815, as amended, includes many 
of these bills which, based upon the comments submitted to the 
Committee on Finance by the public, the U.S. Customs Service, 
the U.S. International Trade Commission, the Office of the U.S. 
Trade Representative, and the U.S. Department of Commerce, the 
Committee has found to be non-controversial.

                  II. Summary of H.R. 3815, as Amended

    Unless otherwise noted, the effective date of the 
provisions described below is either the date of enactment of 
this Act or 15 days thereafter.

                              Short Title
                              (Section 1)

    This section provides that the Act may be cited as the 
``Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 1996.''

                       Payment of Duties and Fees
                              (Section 2)

Current law
    Section 505(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1505(c)), as amended by section 642 of the Customs 
Modernization Act (Mod Act) (enacted as Title VI of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act), 
provides that, when an importer deposits estimated duties with 
the Customs Service when making entry of imported merchandise, 
interest on the deposited duties begins to accrue from the date 
of deposit to the date of liquidation or reliquidation of the 
entries in question. Under this authority, the Customs Service 
collects additional duties from, or refunds excess duties to 
the importer with interest, depending upon the actual duty rate 
Customs establishes at the time of the liquidation or 
reliquidation. Section 642 of the Mod Act became effective on 
December 8, 1993, which was the date of enactment of the NAFTA 
Implementation Act.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 505(c) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to provide an exception to section 642 of the Mod Act for 
interest accrual on duties deposited for those entries eligible 
for NAFTA preferential tariffs. The provision clarifies that 
the new interest accrual provisions under section 642 of the 
Mod Act are effective December 8, 1993. The provision also 
states that the amendment to section 505(c) shall apply to 
claims made on or after June 7, 1996.
Reason for change
    Because an importer has up to one year to make a claim for 
a refund of deposited duties when imported merchandise is 
eligible for NAFTA preferential tariff rates, the provision 
clarifies that the Customs Service will pay interest as of the 
date of the importer's claim, rather than from the date of 
deposit of duties. The effective date corresponds to the date 
the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance requested public comment 
on this legislation.

               Other Technical and Conforming Amendments
                              (Section 3)

    This section makes the following technical corrections with 
a retroactive effective date of December 8, 1993, which 
corresponds to the effective date of the NAFTA Implementation 
Act:
1. Examination of Books and Witnesses
Current law
    Section 509 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1509) 
provides the Customs Service the authority to examine books and 
summon witnesses in its investigations and inquiries.
Explanation of provision
    The provision amends section 509(a) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to correct a citation by changing ``subsection (c)(1)(A)'' 
to ``subsection (d)(1)(A).''
2. Requirement for Certificate for Importation of Alcoholic Liquors 
        Aboard Small Vessels
Current law
    Section 7 of the Act of August 5, 1935 (19 U.S.C. 1707) 
requires certificates of importation for alcoholic beverages 
aboard small vessels.
Explanation of provision
    The provision repeals section 7 of the Act of August 5, 
1935, which is an obsolete statute.
 3. Manifests
Current law
    Section 431 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1431) sets 
forth the rules governing the provision of manifests required 
by the Customs Service.
Explanation of provision
    The provision amends section 431(c)(1) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to clarify that the reference in the section is to vessel 
manifests and not to other types of manifests.
 4. Penalties for Certain Violations
Current law
    Section 592 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1592) 
provides rules for the imposition of penalties for fraud, 
negligence, and gross negligence. Various provisions in this 
section refer to ``lawful duties.''
Explanation of provision
    The provision replaces ``lawful duties'' with ``lawful 
duties, fees and taxes'' in section 592 of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to recognize that the Customs Service also collects fees 
and taxes.
 5. Deprivation of Lawful Duties, Taxes, or Fees
Current law
    Section 592(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1592(d)) provides for the restoration of lawful duties if the 
United States has been deprived of such by a violation of 
section 592.
Explanation of provision
    The provision amends section 592(d) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 by replacing the phrase ``or fees be restored'' with ``and 
fees be restored'' to ensure the restoration of duties, fees 
and taxes to the Customs Service if the United States is 
deprived of duties, fees or taxes by a violation of section 
592.
6. Reconciliation Treated as Entry for Recordkeeping
Current law
    Section 401 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401) 
provides miscellaneous definitions, and section 508 of the Act 
(19 U.S.C. 1508) provides the requirements, time periods, and 
limitations for import recordkeeping.
Explanation of provision
    The provision amends sections 401(s)and 508(c)(1) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 to clarify that reconciliation should be 
treated as an entry for the purposes of record keeping laws and 
thus, records pertaining to reconciliation should be retained 
for a period of five years from the date of filing a 
reconciliation.
 7. Extension of Liquidation
Current law
    Section 504 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1504) 
provides for limitations on the liquidation of entries.
Explanation of provision
    The provision amends section 504(d) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to ensure that the lifting of a suspension of liquidation 
notice does not result in the liquidation of an entry if an 
extension notice has been issued.
8. Exemption from Duty for Personal and Household Goods Accompanying 
        Returning Residents
Current law
    Section 321(a)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1321(a)(2)(B)) originally allowed returning residents arriving 
from foreign countries other than the insular possessions to 
include personal-use items under the duty-free personal 
allowance exemption. Due to a split in tariff classification 
numbers, the tariff numbers applicable to residents returning 
from a foreign country were inadvertently dropped.
Explanation of provision
    The provision corrects section 321(a)(2)(B) of the Tariff 
Act of 1930 to allow U.S. residents returning from a foreign 
country other than an insular possession once again to bring 
personal-use items free of duty, if such articles are valued at 
not more than $400.
9. Debt Collection
Current law
    Section 631(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1631(a)) provides for the use of private collection agencies to 
recover debts arising under the Customs laws and owed to the 
United States.
Explanation of provision
    The provision amends section 631(a) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to clarify that Customs is authorized to pay debt-
collection agencies from recovered funds prior to the deposit 
of such funds with the Treasury.
10. Designation of Customs Officer-
Current law
    Section 509 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1509) 
provides the Customs Service the authority to examine books and 
summon witnesses in its investigations and inquiries.
Explanation of provision
    The provision changes the reference under section 509(b) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 from ``appropriate regional 
commissioner'' to ``officer designated pursuant to the 
regulations'' to reflect management changes as a result of 
reorganization of the Customs Service.
11. Review of Protests
Current law
    Section 515 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1515) 
provides for the review of protests, administrative reviews, 
modifications of decisions, and requests for accelerated 
disposition of requests by Customs district directors.
Explanation of provision
    The provision changes the reference under section 515(d) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 from ``district director'' to ``port 
director'' to reflect management changes as a result of 
reorganization of the Customs Service.
12. Administrative Exemptions
Current law
    Section 321(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1321(a)) provides the Secretary of Treasury authority to 
disregard certain small sums owed to the United States when the 
expense and inconvenience of collection is disproportionate to 
the amount of revenue that would otherwise be collected.
Explanation of provision
    The provision amends section 321(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to clarify that monies owed the Customs Service with 
respect to entries of merchandise include interest as well as 
duties, fees, and taxes.

      Clarification Regarding the Application of Customs User Fees
                              (Section 4)

Current law
    Section 13031(b) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as amended by section 
111(b) of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 (19 U.S.C. 58c(b)), 
provides that, in case of agricultural products of the United 
States that are processed and packed in a Foreign Trade Zone 
(FTZ), the ad valorem merchandise processing fee (MPF) applies 
solely to the value of the foreign material used to make the 
container. It exempts the value of domestic agricultural 
products from the MPF.
    The Customs Service has ruled that, for all products not 
covered by this provision, and in the absence of express 
statutory language to the contrary, the MPF will be assessed on 
both the domestic and foreign value of the merchandise entering 
from foreign trade zones.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 13031(b)(8) of the 1985 COBRA 
to clarify that the ad valorem MPF is to be assessed only 
against the foreign value of merchandise entered from an FTZ. 
The provision would also clarify that the application of the 
MPF to processed agricultural products will apply to all 
entries from FTZs after November 30, 1986, for which 
liquidation has not been finalized.
Reason for change
    The provision is necessary to clarify that Customs will not 
collect user fees based on the value of any domestic content of 
a product in an FTZ.

        Technical Amendment to the Customs and Trade Act of 1990
                              (Section 5)

Current law
    Section 484H(b) of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 (19 
U.S.C. 1553 note) provides for the transportation in bond of 
Canadian lottery material.
Explanation of provision
    This section replaces the phrase ``entered or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption'' in section 484H(b) of the 
Customs and Trade Act of 1990 with the phrase ``entered for 
transportation in bond.''
Reason for change
    The new phrase clarifies that Canadian lottery material 
transported in bond is not entered into the United States for 
consumption.

           Clarification of Fees for Certain Customs Services
                              (Section 6)

Current law
    Section 13031(b)(9)(A) of the 1985 COBRA (19 U.S.C. 
58c(b)(9)(A)) authorizes the Customs Service to provide 
reimbursable services to air couriers operating in express 
consignment carrier facilities and in centralized hub 
facilities. The Customs Service interprets the statute to 
prevent the provision of such reimbursable customs services to 
centralized hub facilities during daytime hours.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 13031(b)(9)(A) of the 1985 
COBRA to clarify that Customs may provide daytime reimbursable 
services to centralized hub facilities during daytime hours. 
The provision also clarifies that Customs may be reimbursed for 
all services related to the determination to release cargo, not 
just ``inspectional'' services, regardless of whether they are 
performed on site or not.
Reason for change
    This provision is a technical clarification of the present 
statutory language in the 1985 COBRA, which Customs has 
interpreted as allowing it to provide reimbursable services 
only during night time hours to centralized hub facilities 
(e.g., air cargo facilities).

       Special Rule for Extending Time for Filing Drawback Claims
                              (Section 7)

Current law
    Section 313(r) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1313) 
requires that a duty drawback entry and all documents necessary 
to complete a claim for duty drawback, including those issued 
by the Customs Service, shall be filed or applied for, as 
applicable, within three years after the date of exportation or 
destruction of the articles on which drawback is claimed. The 
Customs Service has no discretion to extend this deadline.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 313(r) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to permit a temporary one-year extension for filing duty 
drawback claims in cases where the President has declared a 
major natural disaster on or after January 1, 1994, and the 
drawback claimant files a request for such extension with the 
Customs Service within one year from the date of enactment of 
the provision.
Reason for change
    As a result of major natural disasters, such as the 1994 
earthquake in southern California, businesses may be unable to 
file timely drawback petitions, which can result in substantial 
financial loss. The Customs Service currently has no authority 
to extend the three-year deadline for filing duty drawback 
claims. This provision would allow the Customs Service to 
provide additional time to file a drawback claim in the event 
of a major natural disaster.

              Treatment of Entries of Certain Televisions
                              (Section 8)

Current law
    Sections 514 and 520 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1514 and 1520) provide, respectively, for the filing of 
protests against decisions of the Customs Service, and 
authority for the Secretary of Treasury to refund duties in the 
event of errors by the Customs Service in collecting such 
duties.
Explanation of provision
    This section provides for liquidation or reliquidation of 
certain entries of color televisions in accordance with a 1984 
administrative review of an antidumping order by the 
International Trade Administration of the Department of 
Commerce. Any amounts owed by the United States pursuant to the 
liquidation or reliquidation of these subject entries would be 
paid within 90 days after such liquidation or reliquidation.
Reason for change
    The provision corrects an acknowledged error by the Customs 
Service, which resulted in the improper liquidation of certain 
entries of color television sets, which, at the time, were 
under an order suspending liquidation during the pendency of 
the administrative review. As a result, the Customs Service 
retained the estimated duties on the entries deposited by the 
importer, which were in excess of the actual duties owed. The 
importer was unaware of the liquidation until after expiration 
of the one-year deadline for filing a protest with the Customs 
Service in such cases.

   Temporary Duty Suspension for Personal Effects of Participants in 
                     Certain World Athletic Events

                              (Section 9)

Current law
    Chapter 99, subchapter II of the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedules of the United States (HTS) prescribes temporary duty 
reductions or suspensions on imports of specified products. HTS 
subheading 9902.98.04 provides for the duty-free entry of the 
personal effects, equipment, and other materials of 
participants in, officials of, or accredited members of 
delegations to world athletic events, including the XXVI Summer 
Olympiad and the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games.
Explanation of provision
    This section adds HTS heading 9902.98.05 to provide 
temporary duty-free entry for personal effects, athletic 
equipment, and other materials to be used by athletes and 
certain other individuals associated with the 1998 Goodwill 
Games, provided such items are not intended for sale or 
distribution to the public.
Reason for change
    This provision would substantially reduce the Customs 
paperwork to which athletes and officials of the 1998 Goodwill 
Games and their families would otherwise be subjected. Similar 
measures have been enacted for other international athletic 
competitions and are analogous to treatment routinely afforded 
by other countries hosting such events.

                   Miscellaneous Technical Correction
                              (Section 10)

Current law
    Section 313(s)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1313(s)(2)(B)) provides that a drawback successor may designate 
imported merchandise or certain other merchandise for which the 
successor received, before the date of succession, and from the 
person who imported and paid duty on the imported merchandise, 
a certificate of delivery transferring the merchandise to the 
successor.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 313(s)(2)(B) by substituting 
the word ``predecessor'' for the word ``successor'' each time 
it appears.
Reason for change
    The provision makes a technical correction to eliminate 
confusion stemming from incorrect wording in the statute.

                      Uruguay Round Agreements Act
                              (Section 11)

Current law
    Section 405(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) 
(19 U.S.C. 3602(b)) contains the statutory authority for the 
President to undertake a special agricultural safeguard action.
Explanation of provision
    This section corrects an erroneous citation in section 
405(b).

                       Imports of Civil Aircraft
                              (Section 12)

Current law
    General Note 6 of the HTS requires importers of duty-free 
civil aircraft parts to file a written statement with the 
appropriate customs officer (together with such supporting 
documentation as required by the Secretary of the Treasury), 
which states that the imported article has been approved for 
use on civil aircraft by the U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). The term ``civil aircraft'' means all 
aircraft other than aircraft purchased for use by the 
Department of Defense or the Coast Guard.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends HTS General Note 6 to provide that an 
importer is deemed to certify that an imported article is a 
duty-free civil aircraft if the importer enters the article 
under an HTS provision for which the rate of duty ``Free (C)'' 
appears in the ``Special'' subcolumn, and the importer claims 
such rate of duty. The provision requires the importer making 
such entry to maintain such supporting documentation as the 
Secretary of Treasury may require in the event that an audit is 
conducted. The importer may amend the entry or claim a free 
rate of duty at any time before liquidation becomes final, 
except that interest shall not be paid on any resulting refund. 
Finally, the provision modifies the definition of ``civil 
aircraft'' to include aircraft, aircraft engines, and flight 
simulators (including parts, components, and subassemblies 
thereof) that are (1) certified by the FAA or an airworthiness 
authority recognized by the FAA, or (2) purchased for use by 
the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, if such aircraft, 
aircraft engines, and flight simulators (or parts, components, 
or subassemblies thereof) are manufactured or operated pursuant 
to a certificate issued or recognized by the FAA.
Reason for change
    The provision will eliminate the requirement for paper 
filing when claiming duty-free treatment for civil aircraft and 
aircraft parts. The provision would also facilitate the 
importation of these products by broadening the definition of 
``civil aircraft'' in the HTS.

          Technical Correction to Certain Chemical Description
                              (Section 13)

Current law
    HTS subheading 2933.90.02 specifies the tariff 
classification and duty rate for the entry of heterocyclic 
compounds with nitrogen hetero-atom(s) only, and nucleic acids 
and their salts.
Explanation of provision
    This section makes a technical correction to a chemical 
description in HTS subheading 2933.90.02 by deleting the 
reference to quizalofop ethyl. The provision also requires the 
retroactive liquidation or reliquidation of any entry under 
subheading 2933.90.02 made after December 31, 1994, and before 
the date 15 days after the date of enactment of the provision 
when a proper request for such is filed with the Customs 
Service.
Reason for change
    One of the chemical products in this subheading, 2-[4-[(6-
Chloro-2-quinoxalinyl)-oxy-phenoxyl-propionic acid, ethyl 
ester, is an agricultural herbicide for which a temporary duty 
suspension was established in 1990. The URAA made this 
temporary duty suspension permanent under HTS subheading 
2933.90.02. The subject herbicide exists physically as two 
stereoisomers, or compounds with identical chemical formulas 
and atomic connectivity, but with different spatial 
orientations of atomic groups. By striking quizalofop ethyl, 
the provision clarifies that this HTS category covers all 
stereoisomers of this chemical product, and not just one 
particular form of the product imported at the time of 
enactment of the URAA.

          Marking of Certain Imported Articles and Containers
                              (Section 14)

Current law
    Section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1304) 
requires that every article of foreign origin imported into the 
United States, or its container, be marked with the country of 
origin of the article, with certain statutory exceptions.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 304 of the Tariff Act to exempt 
imports of certain coffee, tea, and spices from country of 
origin marking requirements.
Reason for change
    Without the labeling exemption, the country of origin 
marking requirement would impose a significant financial burden 
on the U.S. coffee, tea, and spice industries, which use blends 
imported from a variety of sources. Because there is little or 
no U.S. production of coffee, tea, and spices, requiring a 
country of origin mark for these products would not provide any 
meaningful benefit to U.S. consumers.

      Tariff Treatment of Certain Silver, Gold, and Platinum Bars
                              (Section 15)

Current law
    The former Tariff Schedule of the United States (TSUS) 
provided for duty-free treatment of gold, silver, and platinum 
bullion bars, which are cast or minted. Following replacement 
of the TSUS by the current HTS, these products were included in 
tariff headings under Chapter 71, subchapter II, which are 
subject to various duty rates.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends HTS Chapter 71, subchapter II, so that 
gold, silver, and platinum bullion bars, whether cast or 
minted, receive duty-free treatment.
Reason for change
    Following conversion from the TSUS to the HTS on January 1, 
1989, gold, silver and platinum bars, which had been duty free, 
were inadvertently placed under tariff headings subject to duty 
rates. The provision would restore the duty-free treatment 
these products had previously received under the former TSUS.

      Suspension of Duty on Certain Semimanufactured Forms of Gold
                              (Section 16)

Current law
    Fine diameter gold wire suitable for the manufacture of 
semiconductors is currently classifiable under HTS subheading 
7108.13.50, a basket category for certain semimanufactured 
forms of gold with a column 1 general rate of duty at 6.6 
percent ad valorem.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends Chapter 99 of the HTS by creating a new 
heading 9902.71.08, which provides temporary duty-free 
treatment through December 31, 2000, for certain wire 
containing 99.9 percent or more by weight of gold, with a 
diameter of 0.05 millimeters or less, for use in the 
manufacture of diodes, transistors, and similar semiconductor 
devices or electronic integrated circuits.
Reason for change
    There is no domestic production of the type of fine-
diameter gold wire covered in this provision.

      Elimination of East-West Trade Statistics Monitoring System
                              (Section 17)

Current law
    Section 410 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2440) 
requires that the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) 
monitor trade with non-market countries and publish a quarterly 
report summarizing the data collected.
Explanation of provision
    This section repeals section 410 of the Trade Act of 1974.
Reason for change
    Following the political and economic reforms in central and 
eastern Europe since 1989, the monitoring system and report 
provided by the ITC, which focused on trade with non-market 
countries in those regions, are no longer warranted.

               Retroactive Election To Reconcile Entries
                              (Section 18)

Current law
    Section 401(s) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (10 U.S.C. 
1401(s)) sets forth procedures by which an importer may file 
with the Customs Service a ``reconciliation'' (i.e., 
information about elements of an entry provided to the Customs 
Service after the filing of an entry form or import activity 
summary statement).
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 401(s) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to permit an electronic filing of a reconciliation with 
the Customs Service. The provision also permits that, by mutual 
consent between Customs and the importer, the information 
provided in the reconciliation may also cover other previously 
filed, unliquidated entries.
Reason for change
    The provision will facilitate the process for filing 
reconciliations for both Customs and the importing public. The 
reconciliation process in the Mod Act legislation was written 
to be prospective. The Customs Service and the private sector 
have now recognized that it would be desirable for both parties 
if, by mutual consent, prior, unliquidated entries containing 
the same problem could be included in the reconciliation. This 
language accomplishes that goal.

              Tariff Treatment for Certain Motor Vehicles
                              (Section 19)

Current law
    Automobiles manufactured in U.S. Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) 
that are withdrawn from the FTZ and formally entered for 
consumption in the United States are subject to duty on their 
foreign content. If such automobiles are subsequently exported 
to Canada or Mexico, and then reimported into the United 
States, then no duty is assessed. However, the Customs Service 
has determined that automobiles produced in FTZs that are 
exported directly to Canada or Mexico and not formally entered 
for consumption in the United States, are subject to duty on 
the full value (i.e., both foreign and domestic content) of the 
auto when they re-enter the United States. As a result of the 
implementation of the duty-deferral provisions under the NAFTA 
effective on January 1, 1996, all such vehicles are required to 
be entered prior to export to Canada.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends General Note 3 of the HTS to clarify 
that all automobiles manufactured in U.S. FTZs, exported to 
Canada or Mexico, and subsequently reimported into the United 
States, are subject to duty only on their foreign content. The 
provision would apply to any such automobiles produced in an 
FTZ before January 1, 1996, that are subsequently re-entered 
into the United States (1) on or after the effective date of 
this provision, or (2) that are unliquidated, under protest, in 
litigation, or liquidation is otherwise not final during the 
period between January 1, 1994, and the effective date of the 
provision.
Reason for change
    By clarifying that all automobiles manufactured in U.S. 
FTZs will be subject to duty only on their foreign content upon 
reimportation into the United States, the provision ensures 
that such automobiles exported to Canada and Mexico receive the 
same tariff treatment, irrespective of whether they were first 
entered for consumption in the United States.

                          Technical Amendments
                            (Sections 20-22)

Current law
     The Office of the Law Revision Counsel identified several 
minor technical and clerical errors while codifying certain 
trade laws.
Explanation of provisions
    These sections correct the minor technical and clerical 
errors identified by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel in 
the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), the NAFTA 
Implementation Act, and the Tariff Act of 1930.

             Reliquidating Entry of Warp Knitting Machines
                              (Section 23)

Current law
    Section 514 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1514), as 
amended, outlines rules for the filing of protests against 
decisions of the Customs Service.
Explanation of provision
    This section directs the Customs Service to reliquidate as 
duty free a single entry made on July 12, 1989 of four imported 
warp knitting machines and to refund any duties and interest 
paid on the entry.
Reason for change
    In 1988, an import-export business in North Carolina 
imported four German-made warp knitting machines, which were 
classifiable in the HTS under a duty-free category. The company 
subsequently sold the machines to a Venezuelan company, which 
returned the machines to the North Carolina company upon 
finding them to be unsatisfactory. Upon re-entry of the 
machines in Charleston, South Carolina, the Customs Service 
mistakenly classified the machinery under an incorrect HTS 
number at a duty of 4.4 percent. The provision would remedy 
this Customs' error, which resulted in the importer being 
mistakenly charged duties and interest of approximately $28,000 
for the re-entry of the machines in question.

            Temporary Suspension of Duty on Diclofop-Methyl
                              (Section 24)

Current law
    Chapter 99, subchapter II of the HTS prescribes temporary 
duty reductions or suspensions on imports of specified 
products. Diclofop-methyl (also known as dichlorofopmethyl) in 
bulk form is currently classifiable under HTS subheading 
2918.90.20 and in packaged form under HTS subheading 
3808.30.15, with a respective column 1 general rate of duty at 
12.1 percent and 1.1 cents/kg plus 8.4 percent ad valorem.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends HTS Chapter 99, subchapter II, by 
adding heading 9902.30.16, under which imports of diclofop-
methyl from countries entitled to column 1 general duty rates 
would be allowed duty free entry through December 31, 1998.
Reason for change
    The provision offers a temporary duty suspension on imports 
of diclofop-methyl, an herbicide that can be applied without 
tilling the soil, thereby allowing for the control of weeds 
without the risk of soil erosion. There is no domestic 
production of this product.

   Elimination of Duty on 2-Amino-3-Chlorobenzoic Acid, Methyl Ester
                              (Section 25)

Current law
    Subheading 2922.49.05 of Chapter 29 of the HTS sets the 
column 1 general rates of duty for oxygen-function amino-
compounds, amino-alcohols, and their esters.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends subheading 2922.49.05 of the HTS to 
include 2-Amino-3-chlorobenzoic acid, methyl ester, and 
provides for permanent, duty-free tariff treatment for imports 
from those countries entitled to column 1 general rates of 
duty.
Reason for change
    There is no domestic production of this chemical, which is 
used in the production of an herbicide for soybean broadleaf 
weed control.

  Elimination of Duties on 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (Tetraamino Biphenyl)
                              (Section 26)

Current law
    Under the HTS, 3,3-diaminobenzidine (also known as 
tetraamino biphenyl or ``TAB'') is currently classified under 
subheading 2921.59.40, a basket category with a column 1 
general rate of duty of 12.1 percent ad valorem.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends the HTS by placing 3,3-diaminobenzidine 
under subheading 2921.59.17, with a free rate of duty, 
retroactive to January 1, 1995, the effective date of the URAA.
Reason for change
    It is the Committee's view that TAB should have been added 
to the final list of products included in the U.S. tariff 
concessions during the Uruguay Round negotiations. Under these 
circumstances, the Committee believes it is appropriate to 
provide for reliquidation of entries retroactive to the 
effective date of the URAA. There is no domestic production of 
TAB, a chemical used in the manufacture of a flame-resistant 
fiber.

               Certain Unliquidated Vessel Repair Entries
                              (Section 27)

Current law
    Section 484E of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 (19 
U.S.C. 1466 note) provided that Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) 
barges would be exempt from the duty imposed on foreign vessel 
repairs until December 31, 1992. The URAA made the exemption 
permanent on a prospective basis as of January 1, 1995.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 484E of the Customs and Trade 
Act of 1990 to extend the vessel repair duty exemption to 66 
specific repair entries of LASH barges documented under the 
laws of the United States. The duty exemption is limited to 
vessel repair entries that meet three conditions: (1) the 
entries were made during the period from January 1, 1993 
through December 31, 1994; (2) the entries had not been 
liquidated as of January 1, 1995; and (3) the entries, if they 
had been made on or after January 1, 1995, would otherwise be 
eligible for the duty exemption.
Reason for change
    The provision fills a gap in coverage between the 
previously authorized exemption, which expired December 31, 
1992, and the permanent exemption that became effective January 
1, 1995.

                       Duty on Display Fireworks
                              (Section 28)

Current law
    Subheading 3604.10.00 of the HTS establishes a general rate 
of duty of 5.3 percent ad valorem on all types of fireworks.
Explanation of provision
    This section creates a separate tariff classification for 
display or special fireworks (Class 1.3G fireworks) with a 
general rate of duty of 2.4 percent ad valorem.
Reason for change
    Under section 111 of the URAA, duties on all fireworks 
under an HTS basket category (HTS subheading 3604.10.00) were 
changed from a per kilogram rate to an ad valorem rate. An 
unintended result of this change was to increase the amount of 
duty assessed on high-value, low-weight display fireworks. This 
provision reduces the tariff rate on display fireworks to the 
ad valorem equivalent of the pre-URAA duty collected on these 
types of fireworks.

 Personal Allowance Duty Exemption for Merchandise Purchased in a Duty-
                         Free Sales Enterprise
                              (Section 29)

Current law
    Subchapter IV of HTS Chapter 98 provides that U.S. 
residents who travel outside the country for more than 48 hours 
may bring back up to $400 of merchandise purchased on their 
trip without paying duties or taxes when they return to the 
U.S. (Higher limits apply to residents returning from the U.S. 
insular possessions or from beneficiary countries under either 
the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act or the Andean Trade 
Preference Act.) However, section 555(b)(6) of the Tariff Act 
of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1555(b)(6)) provides that merchandise 
purchased in a duty-free sales enterprise in the United States 
is not eligible for exemption from duty upon the traveler's 
return to the United States.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends section 555(b)(6) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to permit U.S. residents who have been outside the United 
States for at least 48 hours to apply merchandise purchased 
from a U.S. duty-free store against their personal duty-free 
allowance. The provision does not apply to residents returning 
from travel that involves transit to, from, or through a U.S. 
insular possession (American Samoa, Guam, or the Virgin Islands 
of the United States).
Reason for change
    The Committee believes that current law disadvantages U.S. 
duty free stores and is inconsistent with the practices of 
other countries, which allow purchases made in their duty-free 
shops to be reimported under returning-resident allowances. As 
under current law, purchases made in U.S. duty-free shops must 
be made at the beginning of a resident's outbound journey.

           Temporary Duty Suspension for Certain Motorcycles
                              (Section 30)

Current law
    Under current law, non-resident participants in the Sturgis 
Motorcycle Rally and Races must post a bond when their 
motorcycles enter the United States, and then wait for a bond 
release following proof that the goods qualified for duty-free 
entry into the United States.
Explanation of provision
    This section creates a new HTS heading 9902.98.06 
temporarily suspending duties, taxes, and fees on U.S.-produced 
motorcycles previously exported from the United States and 
later brought temporarily into the United States by 
participants in the Sturgis Rally and Races. The suspension 
would apply through December 31, 2006.
Reason for change
    This provision is intended to allow non-resident 
participants in the Sturgis Rally and Races to file an informal 
customs entry and thereby avoid posting a customs bond when 
they bring their U.S.-made motorcycles into the United States. 
This change would substantially reduce the Customs paperwork to 
which participants in the Sturgis Rally and Races would 
otherwise be subjected in seeking reimbursement of the customs 
bond.

            Deferral of Duty on Certain Production Equipment
                              (Section 31)

Current law
    Customs Service Decision 82-103 of March 2, 1982, had held 
that production equipment was not dutiable in a Foreign Trade 
Subzone until it was completely assembled, installed, tested 
and used in full-scale production. This decision was revoked on 
November 30, 1988 by a General Notice published by the Customs 
Service, where Customs took the position that such production 
equipment is dutiable at the time it is first admitted into a 
subzone rather than at the time the production equipment is 
actually used in the intended production.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends the Foreign Trade Zones Act (section 3 
of the Act of June 18, 1934, 19 U.S.C. 81c) to permit the 
deferral of payment of duty on certain production equipment 
admitted into Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and subzones. Payment 
may be deferred until use of such equipment for production 
commences. To qualify for duty deferral, the person admitting 
the equipment must certify to Customs that it is admitted for 
use as production equipment and that it will be entered and 
estimated duties deposited when production begins. The 
equipment shall be subject to tariff classification according 
to its character, condition and quantity, and at the rate of 
duty applicable, when production begins.
Reason for change
    The provision allows for the duty on imported production 
equipment and components installed in a U.S. FTZ or subzone to 
be deferred until use of the equipment for production begins. 
The Committee believes that, by allowing a manufacturer to 
assemble, install, and test the equipment before duties would 
be levied, export production in the United States in FTZs will 
be encouraged.

                Temporary Duty Suspension on Thidiazuron
                              (Section 32)

Current law
    HTS subheading 2934.90.15 provides that the current duty on 
thidiazuron (a plant growth regulator and defoliant) in bulk 
form is 12.1 percent ad valorem. HTS subheading 3808.30.15 
provides for a duty of 1.1 cents/kg plus 8.4 percent ad valorem 
on thidiazuron in packaged form.
Explanation of provision
    This section amends subchapter II of Chapter 99 of the HTS 
to insert a new heading 9902.30.17, temporarily suspending the 
column 1 general rate of duty rate on imports of thidiazuron, 
whether in bulk or packaged form, through December 31, 1998.
Reason for change
    There is no domestic production of this product, which is 
manufactured primarily in Germany.

                       2,3,3-Trimethyl-indolenine
                              (Section 33)

Current law
     Under HTS subheading 2933.90.82, the current rate of duty 
on 2,3,3-Trimethyl-indolenine is 3 cents/kg plus 14.3 percent 
ad valorem. Indolenine is a synthetic organic chemical used as 
a chemical intermediate in the production of certain dyes.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends subchapter II of Chapter 99 of the HTS 
to insert a new heading 9902.33.90, suspending temporarily the 
column 1 general rate of duty on imports of indolenine through 
December 31, 1999.
Reason for change
    There is no domestic production of this product.

                Bis(4-Amino-3-Methylcyclohexyl)-Methane
                              (Section 34)

Current law
     HTS subheading 2921.30.30 provides for a current rate of 
duty of 3 cents/kg plus 14.7 percent ad valorem on imports of 
Bis(4-amino-3-methylcyclohexyl)-methane, which is a synthetic 
organic chemical intermediate used as a curing agent for epoxy 
resins, which are further used in the manufacture of products 
for the automobile industry.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends subchapter II of Chapter 99 of the HTS 
to insert a new heading 9902.30.30, suspending temporarily the 
column 1 general rate of duty on imports of Bis(4-amino-3-
methylcyclohexyl)-methane through December 31, 1999.
Reason for change
     There is no domestic production of this chemical (more 
commonly referred to as Dimethyldicykane).

      Limitation on Designation as Beneficiary Developing Country
                              (Section 35)

Current law
     Under section 502(b)(2)(F) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(2)(F)), the President may not 
designate any country as a beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) 
that aids or abets, by granting sanctuary from prosecution to, 
any individual or group which has committed an act of 
international terrorism.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends the current statutory provision 
relating to terrorism by adding language that would deny GSP 
beneficiary status to any country found by the Secretary of 
State to support international acts of terrorism. The effective 
date of this provision is October 1, 1996.
Reason for change
     This change would make the requirements for participation 
in the GSP program consistent with the requirements of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which provides that countries 
that sponsor terrorism are ineligible for U.S. foreign 
assistance.

Temporary Duty Suspension on Certain Chemicals Used in the Formulation 
                      of an HIV Protease Inhibitor
                              (Section 36)

Current law
    Under current law, the column 1 general rate of duty on 
three chemical compounds required for the formulation of an HIV 
protease inhibitor currently in advanced clinical trials is 
12.1 percent ad valorem. The three chemicals are identified in 
the following HTS categories: (1) HTS subheading 2918.29.65 (3-
Acetoxy-2-methylbenzoyl chloride); (2) HTS subheading 
2922.19.60 ((S-R*,S*))-(3-Chloro-2-hydroxy-1-
((phenylthio)methyl)propyl)-carbamic acid phenylmethyl ester); 
and (3) HTS subheading 2933.40.60 (N-(1-1-dimethylethyl) 
decahydro-2 [2-hydroxy-3-[(3-hydroxy-2-methyl- benzoyl)amino]-
4-(phenylthio)butyl]-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide, [3S-
[2(2S*,3S*),3.a.,4.a.b.,8.a.b.]]).
Explanation of provision
     This section suspends through March 31, 1997, any duties 
applicable to imports of the three chemical compounds described 
above.
Reason for change
     Pursuant to an agreement under the auspices of the World 
Trade Organization, the three chemical compounds are expected 
to be added to the list of pharmaceuticals on which all duties 
imposed by the United States and our major trading partners are 
proposed to be eliminated as of April 1, 1997. Because there is 
no domestic manufacture of the three chemical compounds in 
question and it is expected they will become duty free after 
April 1, 1997, the Committee believes that a duty suspension 
until that date is appropriate. The Committee believes such 
action will help to ensure that drugs for the treatment of HIV 
and AIDS are made available as swiftly and at as low a cost as 
possible.

            Treatment of Certain Entries of Buffalo Leather
                              (Section 37)

Current law
     Under Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 2461 et seq.), certain imports from countries designated 
as beneficiary developing countries enter the United States 
duty free under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences 
(GSP). Imports that exceed the so-called competitive-need limit 
(i.e., imports accounting for more than 50 percent of total 
imports of the product in question) lose their GSP eligibility 
for the following year. The competitive-need limit may, 
however, be waived where imports are de minimis.
Explanation of provision
     This section provides for the liquidation or reliquidation 
of two entries made during the month of July 1995 of buffalo 
leather imported from Thailand at the GSP rate of duty that 
applied as of June 30, 1995.
Reason for change
     On June 30, 1995, the product in question lost its 
eligibility for GSP tariff treatment because it had exceeded 
the 50 percent GSP competitive-need limit in 1994. Although the 
importer filed an emergency request for a de minimis 
competitive need waiver on April 17, 1995, the request was not 
acted upon until July 28, 1995, when the President signed 
Presidential Proclamation 6813 to restore the GSP eligibility 
of buffalo leather from Thailand. Because the President lacked 
authority to restore GSP eligibility retroactively, the 
proclamation was effective only with respect to imports entered 
after July 31, 1995. This provision would allow for GSP 
treatment with respect to two entries made during the period 
between July 1 and July 31, 1995.

                   Fees for Certain Customs Services
                              (Section 38)

Current law
     Section 13031(b) of the 1985 COBRA (19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(5)) 
provides for the collection of fees for certain Customs 
services, and establishes limitations on such fees. Section 521 
of the NAFTA Implementation Act temporarily increased the 
Customs COBRA passenger processing fee from $5 to $6.50 and 
lifted the exemption on passengers arriving from Canada, 
Mexico, and the Caribbean during the period from January 1, 
1994 through September 30, 1997. Section 521 also amended the 
COBRA to provide that passengers on so-called ``cruises to 
nowhere'' are liable for payment of the passenger processing 
fee. Customs has interpreted this provision as requiring the 
collection of the fee each time a ship touches at a U.S. port, 
even if the vessel is on a single continuous voyage and lands 
at several U.S. ports.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends section 13031(b) of the 1985 COBRA to 
provide for a one-time only collection of fees in the course of 
a single voyage for a passenger aboard a commercial vessel.
Reason for change
     The Committee believes this provision is necessary to 
clarify that, in the situation described above, Customs may 
collect the passenger processing fee only once.

      Injury Determinations for Certain Countervailing Duty Orders
                              (Section 39)

Current law
     Section 753 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1675b) 
requires an injury test for outstanding countervailing duty 
orders formerly issued under section 303 of the Tariff Act of 
1930 (since repealed) that was applicable to countries that 
were not parties to the 1979 Subsidies Agreement when the order 
was issued, but that have subsequently become parties to the 
Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures administered 
by the World Trade Organization (WTO). Section 701(c) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 provides that an injury test is not required 
with respect to countervailing duty investigations involving 
imports from countries that are not WTO members.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends section 753 of the Tariff Act of 1930 
to provide an injury test in countervailing duty investigations 
under section 701(c) of the Tariff Act (involving imports not 
entitled to a material-injury determination), when the country 
from which the products originate later becomes a WTO member 
and thereby party to the Agreement on Subsidies and 
Countervailing Measures.
Reason for change
     Once countries become parties to the WTO Agreement on 
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, all other parties to 
that Agreement must provide for an injury determination in 
countervailing duty investigations involving imports from the 
new party. This provision would facilitate administration of 
the countervailing duty law by providing for such an injury 
determination when countries later join the WTO and become 
parties to the WTO Subsidies Agreement.

        Treatment of Difference Between Collections of Estimated
             Antidumping Duty and Final Assessed Duty Under
                         Antidumping Duty Order
                              (Section 40)

Current law
     Section 737(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1673f(a)), as amended by section 219(c)(10) of the URAA, 
provides that if the amount of the cash deposit collected as 
security for an estimated antidumping duty is different from 
the final assessed duty, the difference will be disregarded if 
the amount of the cash deposit is less than the final duty, and 
the difference will be refunded if the amount of the cash 
deposit is more than the amount of the final assessed duty. 
Section 707 of the Tariff Act of 1930 provides analogous 
treatment for deposits of estimated countervailing duties, but 
applies to bonds or other securities in addition to cash 
deposits.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends section 737(a) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 to conform the language in the antidumping law with the 
countervailing duty law with respect to the collection of 
deposits of estimated duties. Amended section 737(a) would 
apply, therefore, to cash deposits, bonds or other securities, 
as is the case with the countervailing duty law.
Reason for change
     The change is necessary to harmonize the language in the 
antidumping law and the countervailing duty law with respect to 
the deposit of estimated duties.

                   Certain Lead Fuel Test Assemblies
                              (Section 41)

Current law
     Under HTS Chapter 98, various test items may enter the 
United States duty-free under bond, provided that they are re-
exported or destroyed within a maximum period of three years 
from the date of entry.
Explanation of provision
     This section would direct the Secretary of Treasury to 
liquidate or reliquidate as duty-free, and to refund duties 
paid on four entries of lead-fuel test assemblies of nuclear-
fuel rods, upon the filing of a proper request by the importer.
Reason for change
     Although current law allows duty-free treatment of various 
test items, subject to the limitations described above, U.S. 
utilities require six to eight years to analyze the entire 
useful life of lead-fuel test assemblies of nuclear-fuel rods. 
Disposal of the assemblies is subsequently conducted under U.S. 
law governing radioactive scrap. This provision would allow an 
exception to the three-year test period limitation for four 
entries of lead fuel test assemblies.

        Suspension of Duty on Certain Injection Molding Machines
                              (Section 42)

Current law
     HTS subheading 8477.10.80 provides for a column 1 general 
rate of duty of 3.6 percent ad valorem on imports of certain 
injection molding machines.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends HTS Chapter 99, subchapter II, by 
adding heading 9902.84.77, which provides for temporary duty-
free treatment through December 31, 2000, for imports of 
certain injection molding machines used in the manufacture of 
semiconductors.
Reason for change
    There is no domestic production of these products.

         Reliquidation of Certain Entries of Color Televisions
                              (Section 43)

Current law
     Sections 514 and 520 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1514 and 1520) provide, respectively, for the filing of 
protests against decisions of the Customs Service, and 
authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to refund duties in 
the event of errors by the Customs Service in collecting such 
duties.
Explanation of provision
     This section directs the Customs Service to reliquidate 
certain entries of imported television sets at a duty rate set 
in an administrative review of a dumping order on television 
sets.
Reason for change
     This provision would correct an acknowledged mistake by 
the Customs Service that resulted in the improper liquidation 
of these entries. (At the time of their liquidation, the 
entries were under a suspension of liquidation order during the 
pendency of the administrative review.) As a result, the 
Customs Service retained the estimated duties deposited by the 
importer, which were in excess of the actual duties owed. The 
importer was unaware of the liquidation until after expiration 
of the one-year deadline for filing a protest with the Customs 
Service in such cases.

        Articles Used To Provide Repair and Maintenance Services
                              (Section 44)

Current law
     Under HTS heading 9804.00.10, tools of trade, occupation, 
or employment that have been taken abroad by a person returning 
to the United States from a foreign country are considered a 
personal exemption and enter the United States duty free.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends Chapter 98, subchapter I of the HTS by 
adding a new heading to permit the duty-free entry of ``tools 
of the trade'' by corporations as well as individuals.
Reason for change
     Under the Customs Service's interpretation of current law, 
goods used by technicians and engineers to provide repair 
services abroad may be brought in duty-free under the personal-
allowance exemption, but only if the same individual that took 
the goods abroad accompanies them on their return. By allowing 
for duty-free re-entry for such goods, the provision would 
simplify the customs procedures for U.S. companies that provide 
such services and are unable to avail themselves of the 
personal-allowance exemption.

               Yttrium Oxide and Cerium Aluminum Terbium
                              (Section 45)

Current law
     HTS subheading 3206.50.00 establishes a column 1 general 
rate of duty of 8.6 percent ad valorem on imports of inorganic 
products used as luminophores, including yttrium oxide and 
cerium aluminum terbium.
Explanation of provision
     This section of the bill (as modified by a subsequent 
Chairman's technical amendment) amends subchapter II of Chapter 
99 of the HTS to insert a new heading (9902.32.06), suspending 
temporarily the column 1 general rate of duty on imports of 
yttrium oxide and cerium aluminum terbium, of a kind used as 
luminophores, through December 31, 2000.
Reason for change
     These materials are inorganic chemicals that are 
luminophores used in the production of fluorescent lighting, 
and are not produced in the United States.

                   Pharmaceutical Grade Phospholipids
                              (Section 46)

Current law
     HTS subheading 2923.20.10 provides for the duty-free entry 
of certain types of purified egg phospholipids, used 
intravenously to assist patients who have difficulty digesting 
food.
Explanation of provision
     This section directs the Customs Service to liquidate or 
reliquidate certain entries of phospholipids made between March 
29, 1991, and January 1, 1995, at a lower rate of duty.
Reason for change
     The provision would correct an unintended increase in the 
tariff rate on these products that resulted from the conversion 
from the TSUS to the HTS. The tariff was eventually eliminated 
on these products on January 1, 1995, as a result of enactment 
of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.

Certain Structures, Parts, and Components Used in the Gemini Telescopes 
                       Project, Mauna Kea, Hawaii
                              (Section 47)

Current law
     Subchapter X of Chapter 98 of the HTS implements the 
Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific, and 
Cultural Material (referred to as the Florence Agreement). This 
subchapter provides for the duty-free entry of instruments and 
apparatus for the use of any nonprofit institution, whether 
public or private, established for educational or scientific 
purposes, if no instrument or apparatus of equivalent 
scientific value is being manufactured in the United States.
Explanation of provision
     This section allows duty-free entry of imports of certain 
components used in the construction of the Gemini North 
Telescope on Hawaii, which is part of the international Gemini 
Telescopes project.
Reason for change
     The Customs Service has taken the position that subchapter 
X of Chapter 98 of the HTS does not include parts and 
components of scientific instruments or apparatus. However, all 
other countries involved in the Gemini Telescope project have 
agreed to waive both taxes and any customs duties for the 
project, and the Committee believes it is appropriate in this 
case for the United States to waive customs duties on the 
components specified in the legislation. The Committee expects, 
however, to work with the Administration to develop a general 
provision, consistent with the requirements of the Florence 
Agreement, to address the importation of components of 
instruments, apparatus and associated peripherals. Such a 
general provision would obviate the need for legislation 
providing for duty suspensions with respect to specific 
projects.

                Articles Provided to Steward Observatory
                              (Section 48)

Current law
     Section 240 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 
2994) authorized, under certain conditions, the duty-free entry 
of articles provided by the Max Planck Institute for 
Radioastronomy of Germany for a joint astronomical project 
undertaken with the Steward Observatory of the University of 
Arizona. The authorization expired November 1, 1993.
     Subchapter X of Chapter 98 of the HTS implements the 
Florence Agreement. This subchapter provides for the duty-free 
entry of instruments and apparatus entered for the use of any 
nonprofit institution, whether public or private, established 
for educational or scientific purposes, if no instrument or 
apparatus of equivalent scientific value is being manufactured 
in the United States.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends section 240 of the Trade and Tariff 
Act of 1984 to authorize duty-free entry of imports of articles 
provided to the Steward Observatory by the Max Planck Institute 
in Germany. The section also provides for duty-free entry of 
the large binocular telescope components, parts and equipment 
provided to the Steward Observatory by the Arcetri 
Astrophysical Observatory in Italy and the Max Planck 
Institute.
Reason for change
     This provision reauthorizes an expired provision of law 
that facilitates joint projects undertaken by the Steward 
Observatory and the Max Planck Institute. In addition, since 
the Customs Service has interpreted subchapter X of Chapter 98 
to apply only to instruments and apparatus, and not the 
components of such instruments or apparatus, legislation is 
required to authorize the duty-free importation of specific 
components of the large binocular telescope provided by the Max 
Planck Institute and the Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory. The 
Committee expects, however, to work with the Administration to 
develop a general provision, consistent with the requirements 
of the Florence Agreement, to address the importation of 
components of instruments, apparatus and associated 
peripherals. Such a general provision would obviate the need 
for legislation providing for duty suspensions with respect to 
specific projects.

   Reliquidation of Certain Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice Entries
                              (Section 49)

Current law
     Sections 514 and 520 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1514 and 1520) provide, respectively, for the filing of 
protests against decisions of the Customs Service, and 
authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to refund duties in 
the event of errors by the Customs Service in collecting such 
duties.
Explanation of provision
     This section directs the Customs Service to reliquidate 
certain entries of imported frozen concentrated orange juice 
(FCOJ) at a duty rate set in an administrative review of an 
antidumping order on FCOJ.
Reason for change
     This provision corrects an acknowledged mistake by the 
Customs Service that resulted in the improper liquidation of 
these entries. (At the time of their liquidation, the entries 
were under a suspension of liquidation order during the 
pendency of the administrative review.) As a result, the 
Customs Service retained the estimated duties on the entries 
deposited by the importer, which were in excess of the actual 
duties owed. The importer was unaware of the liquidation until 
after expiration of the one-year deadline for filing a protest 
with Customs in such cases.

                   Twine, Cordage, Ropes, and Cables
                              (Section 50)

Current law
     HTS subheading 5607.49.15 establishes a column 1 general 
rate of duty of 7.8 percent ad valorem for twine, cordage, 
ropes and cables of polyethylene or polypropylene that are less 
than 4.8 mm. in diameter. Subheading 5607.49.25 establishes a 
tariff of 24 cents/kg plus 13.1 percent ad valorem for such 
articles of greater diameter. HTS subheading 5607.50.20 
establishes only one tariff rate for twine, cordage, ropes and 
cables of other synthetic fibers, regardless of dimension. The 
tariff on such articles is 26.1 cents/kg plus 14.2 percent ad 
valorem.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends the HTS to provide for a column 1 
general rate of duty of 7.8 percent ad valorem on certain 
specialty twine made of synthetic fibers other than 
polyethylene or polypropylene that is less than 3.5 mm. in 
diameter, and makes conforming changes to the tariff rate on 
other twine, cordage, ropes and cables made of other synthetic 
fibers. This section also provides for the liquidation or 
reliquidation of entries of the specialty twine in question 
retroactive to 1989 under the lower duty rate.
Reason for change
     Following conversion from the TSUS to the HTS on January 
1, 1989, the specialty twine in question, which had been 
subject to a duty rate of 8 percent ad valorem, was placed 
under a tariff category subject to a higher ad valorem 
equivalent tariff rate of 19.22 percent. This provision 
restores the lower rate of duty, modified by the authorized 
staged rate reduction, which was inadvertently increased as a 
result of the conversion to the HTS. It is the Committee's 
intention that any quota category currently applicable to HTS 
subheading 5607.50.20 shall be applicable to the two new 
subheadings (HTS 5607.50.25 and HTS 5607.50.35) added by this 
legislation. The Committee expects that quotas shall be 
negotiated with U.S. trading partners with exports subject to 
quota in the usual manner. However, the aggregate amount of 
merchandise eligible to enter the United States from countries 
subject to quota restrictions under HTS subheadings 5607.50.25 
and 5607.50.35, when added together, shall not exceed the 
amount of merchandise eligible to enter the United States in 
1996 under HTS subheading 5607.50.20. There would be an 
exception for permissible or required increases based on the 
total amount under former HTS subheading 5607.50.20, which may, 
by law, and consistent with U.S. international obligations, be 
negotiated by appropriate agencies of the United States in 
succeeding years.

            Suspension of Duty on Certain Fatty Acid Esters
                              (Section 51)

Current law
     HTS subheading 3824.90.40 provides for a column 1 general 
rate of duty of 4.6 percent ad valorem on certain fatty acid 
esters used principally in the production of shampoo.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends subchapter II of Chapter 99 of the HTS 
to insert a new heading (9902.38.24), suspending the column 1 
general rate of duty on imports of these fatty acid esters 
through December 31, 2000.
Reason for change
     The Committee understands that domestic production of this 
product is consumed internally by the producers. No industry 
opposition to this provision has been expressed to the 
Committee.

     Duty Suspension on the Entry of a Mobile Bison Slaughter Unit
                              (Section 52)

Current law
     Under the HTS, a mobile bison slaughter unit is 
classifiable under subheading 8705.90.00, a basket category 
with a column 1 general rate of duty of 2.2 percent ad valorem.
Explanation of provision
     This section provides for the duty-free treatment of one 
specified entry of a mobile bison slaughter unit or require the 
reliquidation of such entry if liquidation becomes final before 
the entry into force of this provision.
Reason for change
     This provision would provide duty-free treatment to one 
entry of a mobile bison slaughter unit procured through a 
federal grant to enable an Indian tribe to sell bison products 
in accordance with Federal regulatory standards and traditional 
tribal beliefs and practices. The grant was insufficient to 
cover approximately $35,000 in duties that would be assessed 
upon importation of the unit. There is no domestic production 
of the mobile bison slaughter unit covered by this provision.

    Exemption From Tariffs and Fees for Certain Aircraft Parts and 
                               Equipment
                              (Section 53)

Current law
     Chapter 88 of the HTS generally covers aircraft parts and 
equipment.
Explanation of provision
     This section would amend General Note 16 of the HTS to 
exempt from tariffs and fees certain aircraft parts and 
equipment, which, while being used abroad, are withdrawn from 
service due to an accident, breakdown or emergency and are 
returned to the United States for repair within 45 days.
Reason for change
     This provision would partially codify an existing Treasury 
Decision (T.D. 55507(3)), which exempts from entry or payment 
of duty certain aircraft parts and equipment, which break down 
while in service abroad. This provision will ensure that such 
articles, which were made in the United States or were 
previously imported and cleared by Customs into the United 
States, will not be subject to duplicative tariff and entry 
requirements when they are brought back to the United States 
for repair.

             Reliquidation of Certain Entries of Live Swine
                              (Section 54)

Current law
     Sections 514 and 520 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1514 and 1520) provide, respectively, for the filing of 
protests against decisions of the Customs Service, and 
authority for the Secretary of Treasury to refund duties in the 
event of errors by the Customs Service in collecting such 
duties.
Explanation of provision
     This section directs the Customs Service to reliquidate 
certain entries of live swine at the duty rate set forth in the 
April 30, 1993 amended final results of the administrative 
review of the countervailing duty order on live swine. Any 
amounts owed by the United States pursuant to the reliquidation 
of these subject entries would be paid within 90 days after 
such reliquidation.
Reason for change
     This provision would correct an acknowledged mistake by 
the Customs Service, which resulted in the improper liquidation 
of certain entries of live swine. At the time of their 
liquidation, the entries were under a suspension of liquidation 
order during the pendency of the administrative review and 
subsequent review by a U.S.-Canada Binational Panel and 
Extraordinary Challenge Committee. As a result, the Customs 
Service retained the estimated duties deposited by the 
importer, which were in excess of the actual duties owed. The 
importer was unaware of the liquidation until after expiration 
of the one-year deadline for filing a protest in such cases.

          Reliquidation of Certain Entries of Sewing Machines
                              (Section 55)

Current law
     Section 514 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1514) 
provides for the filing of protests against decisions of the 
Customs Service.
Explanation of provision
     This section directs the Customs Service to reliquidate 
certain entries of sewing machines after receiving a proper 
request demonstrating that such entries are qualified for 
reimbursement in accordance with a 1993 decision by the United 
States Court of International Trade (CIT) in Pfaff American 
Sales Corp. v. United States, 17 CIT 550 (1993). Any amounts 
owed by the United States pursuant to the reliquidation of 
these subject entries would be paid within 90 days after such 
reliquidation.
Reason for change
     A company protested the classification of certain imported 
sewing machines by the Customs Service and, upon denial of the 
protest, filed an action at the CIT to challenge Customs' 
decision. The company's case was stayed pending resolution of a 
test case filed by another company with respect to the same 
type of products. The CIT found that Customs' classification of 
the sewing machines was in error, and Customs subsequently 
reliquidated the disputed entries in both cases in conformity 
to the court's decision. Because the company in question 
inadvertently omitted 68 entries from its summons and 
complaint, Customs did not reliquidate those entries at the 
lower, correct duty rate.

   Temporary Duty Suspension on Certain Textured Rolled Glass Sheets
                              (Section 56)

Current law
     Under the HTS, unfinished textured rolled glass sheets 
that are used to produce glass-ceramic stovetops are 
classifiable under subheading 7003.19.00, a basket category 
with a column 1 general rate of duty of 1.5 percent ad valorem.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends subchapter II of Chapter 99 of the HTS 
to insert a new subheading 9902.70.03, suspending temporarily 
the column 1 general rate of duty on imports of certain 
unfinished textured rolled glass sheets used in the production 
of glass-ceramic stovetops through December 31, 1998.
Reason for change
     This provision would correct a competitive imbalance in 
the tariff provisions which favors foreign production of glass-
ceramic stovetops. Because of an inverted tariff, imports of 
the unfinished glass sheets are subject to a higher rate of 
duty than imports of the finished glass ceramic stovetops 
(which enter duty-free under HTS subheading 8516.90.65). There 
is no domestic production of the glass sheets covered by this 
provision.

                  Temporary Suspension of Duty on DEMT
                              (Section 57)

Current law
     Under the HTS, N,N-diethyl-m-toluidine (commonly known, 
DEMT) is classifiable under HTS subheading 2921.43.80, a basket 
category with a column 1 general rate of duty of 1.9 cents/kg 
plus 16.3 percent ad valorem.
Explanation of provision
     This section amends subchapter II of Chapter 99 of the HTS 
to insert a new heading 9902.22.12, suspending temporarily the 
column 1 general rate of duty on imports of DEMT through 
December 31, 1998.
Reason for change
     DEMT is a raw material used in the manufacture of color 
developers for the motion picture and photographic industries. 
The sole domestic manufacturer of DEMT has announced it intends 
to cease production as of January 1, 1997. This action will 
force U.S. companies that use the product to import it from 
foreign producers.

                 Investigation on Cattle and Beef Trade
                              (Section 58)

Current law
     Section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 provides that the 
U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) shall make such 
investigations and reports as the U.S. Senate Committee on 
Finance and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways 
and Means may request.
Explanation of provision
     This section would require the ITC to conduct a study on 
the impact of NAFTA and the Uruguay Round Agreements on U.S. 
imports and exports of live cattle for slaughter and fresh, 
chilled, and frozen beef and to examine the issue of 
transshipment of live cattle and fresh, chilled, and frozen 
beef through Mexico and Canada for importation into the United 
States. The ITC would be required to present its findings 
within 270 days of the date of enactment of this Act.
Reason for change
     Since the NAFTA and the Uruguay Round Agreement came into 
effect with respect to the United States, the Committee 
understands that there has been an unexpectedly large increase 
in imports of live cattle and fresh, chilled, and frozen beef 
into the United States, particularly from Canada and Mexico.

           Special Rule for Generalized System of Preferences
                              (Section 59)

Current law
    Section 503(c)(2)(F) of the Trade Act of 1974, which sets 
the figure for the de minimis waiver of the competitive need 
limit, refers to a dollar amount in 1996. Section 503(d), which 
describes the competitive need limit waiver, refers to products 
declared ineligible in the preceding calendar year.
Explanation of provision
    This section would include a special rule to allow the 
President to implement waivers in connection with the results 
of the 1994 competitive need reviews using the standards set 
forth in the law as it existed on July 31, 1995, and based on 
1994 data.
Reason for change
    The GSP statute, as reauthorized by Congress in July 1996, 
leaves a gap in Presidential authority to determine competitive 
need limit waivers and de minimis waivers for products declared 
ineligible for duty-free treatment due to competitive need 
limits in 1995.

                      III. Votes of the Committee

    In compliance with section 133 of the Legislative 
Reorganization Act of 1946, the Committee states that H.R. 
3815, as amended, was ordered favorably reported unanimously by 
voice vote on September 25, 1996.

                          IV. Budgetary Impact

    In compliance with sections 308 and 403 of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and paragraph 11(a) of Rule 
XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the following letter 
has been received from the Congressional Budget Office on the 
budgetary impact of the legislation:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

                 V. Regulatory Impact and Other Matters

    In compliance with paragraph 11(b) of Rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, the Committee states that the 
legislation will not significantly regulate any individuals or 
businesses, will not impact on the personal privacy of 
individuals, and will result in no significant additional 
paperwork.

                      VI. Changes in Existing Law

    In compliance with paragraph 12 of Rule XXVI of the 
Standing Rules of the Senate, changes in existing law made by 
the legislation, as reported, are shown as follows (existing 
law proposed to be omitted is enclosed in black brackets, new 
matter is printed in italic, existing law in which no change is 
proposed is shown in roman):

from the particular requirements of marking provided for in any 
other provision of law.

  (b) Investigations of Violations by Commission.--(1) * * *
          * * * * * * *
  (3) Whenever, in the course of an investigation under this 
section, the Commission has reason to believe, based on 
information before it, that a matter, in whole or in part, may 
come within the purview of subtitle B of title VII of this Act, 
it shall promptly notify the Secretary of Commerce so that such 
action may be taken as is otherwise authorized by [such section 
and] such subtitle. If the Commission has reason to believe 
that the matter before it (A) is based solely on alleged acts 
and effects which are within the purview of section 701 or 731,

respect to which action is prohibited by section 1008 of title 
17, United States Code, the Commission shall terminate, or not 
institute, any investigation into the matter. If the Commission 
has reason to believe the matter before it is based in part on 
alleged acts and effects which are within the purview of 
section 701 or 731 of this Act, and in part on alleged acts and 
effects which may, independently from or in conjunction with 
those within the purview of such section, establish a basis for 
relief under this section, then it may institute or continue an 
investigation into the matter. If the Commission notifies the 
Secretary or the administering authority (as defined in section 
771(1) of this Act) with respect to a matter under this 
paragraph, the Commission may suspend its investigation during 
the time the matter is before the Secretary or administering 
authority for final decision. Any final decision by the 
administering authority under section 701 or 731 of this Act 
with respect to the matter within such section 701 or 731 of 
which the Commission has notified the Secretary or 
administering authority shall be conclusive upon the Commission 
with respect to the issue of less-than-fair-value sales or 
subsidization and the matters necessary for such decision.

                Service may, for good and sufficient reason, 
                serve notice in writing upon any customs broker 
                to show cause why a license or permit issued 
                under this section should not be revoked or 
                suspended. The notice shall be in the form of a 
                statement specifically setting forth the 
                grounds of the complaint, and shall allow the 
                customs broker 30 days to respond. If no 
                response is filed, or the Customs Service 
                determines that the revocation or suspension is 
                still warranted, it shall notify the customs 
                broker in writing of a hearing to be held 
                within 30 days, or at a later date if the 
                broker requests an extension and shows good 
                cause therefor, before an administrative law 
                judge appointed pursuant to section 3105 of 
                title 5, United States Code, who shall serve as 
                the hearing officer. If the customs broker 
                waives the hearing, or the broker or his 
                designated representative fails to appear at 
                the appointed time and place, the hearing 
                officer shall make findings and recommendations 
                based on the record submitted by the parties. 
                At the hearing, the customs broker may be 
                represented by counsel, and all proceedings, 
                including the proof of the charges and the 
                response thereto shall be presented with 
                testimony taken under oath and the right of 
                cross-examination accorded to both parties. A 
                transcript of the hearing shall be made and a 
                copy will be provided to the Customs Service 
                and the customs broker; which shall thereafter 
                be provided reasonable opportunity to file a 
                post-hearing brief. Following the conclusion of 
                the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit 
                promptly the record of the hearing along with 
                the findings of fact and recommendations to the 
                Secretary for decision. The Secretary will 
                issue a written decision, based solely on the 
                record, setting forth [his] the findings of 
                fact and the reasons for the decision. Such 
                decision may provide for the sanction contained 
                in the notice to show cause or any lesser 
                sanction authorized by this subsection, 
                including a monetary penalty not to exceed 
                $30,000, then was contained in the notice to 
                show cause.
