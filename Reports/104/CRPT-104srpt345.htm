   Mrs. Kassebaum, from the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 
                        submitted the following

                              R E P O R T

                     [To accompany S. Con. Res. 52]

    The Committee on Labor and Human Resources, to which was 
referred the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 52) to 
recognize and encourage the convening of a National Silver 
Haired Congress, having considered the same, reports favorably 
thereon without amendment and recommends that the concurrent 
resolution do pass.

                              introduction

    The resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 52, recognizes 
and encourages the convening of a National Silver Haired 
Congress in the District of Columbia. A National Silver Haired 
Congress would be modeled after the U.S. Congress. It would 
take up legislation on issues affecting seniors, such as 
consumer protection, crime prevention, health care, housing, 
and long-term care. The bills it passes would be presented to 
national legislators.
    The National Silver Haired Congress organization is a 
nonprofit, nonpartisan, educational institution. The yearly 
event will have no cost to the Federal Government. The event 
would not be held in the Capitol or in Senate or House office 
buildings.

                          purpose and summary

    Many States have encouraged and facilitated the convening 
of senior citizen legislative and advocacy bodies. These bodies 
have provided older Americans with the opportunity to express 
their concerns by making recommendations to State governments.
    A National Silver Haired Congress, with representatives 
from each State, would provide a national forum for issues 
concerning seniors. The nonpartisan body would propose 
grassroots solutions to the concerns of seniors. Since the 
population of older Americans is growing faster than any other 
age group, it is more important than ever to encourage their 
input in the political process.

                         history of legislation

    This resolution passed the Senate and the House of 
Representatives in 1994. However, since each resolution was not 
voted on by the other Chamber, neither was technically adopted. 
With the intent of getting the resolution formally adopted, 
Senator Mikulski, along with 42 other cosponsors, reintroduced 
the bill on April 17, 1996. It was marked up by the Senate 
Committee on Labor and Human Resources on July 17, 1996, by a 
voice vote.
    The organizers of the National Silver Haired Congress have 
decided to go ahead and hold the first annual Congress in 
February of 1997. The organizers believe they have the 
endorsement of Congress, even though the resolution wasn't 
technically adopted.

                 tabulation of votes cast in committee

    The resolution was passed by voice vote.

                             cost estimate

    There is no cost.

                      regulatory impact statement

    The committee has determined that there will be minimal 
increases in the regulatory burden imposed by this bill.
