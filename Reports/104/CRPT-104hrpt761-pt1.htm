  Mr. Young of Alaska, from the Committee on Resources, submitted the 
                               following

                              R E P O R T

                        [To accompany H.R. 2711]

      [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]

    The Committee on Resources, to whom was referred the bill 
(H.R. 2711) to provide for the substitution of timber for the 
canceled Elkhorn Ridge Timber Sale, having considered the same, 
report favorably thereon without amendment and recommend that 
the bill do pass.

                          purpose of the bill

    The purpose of H.R. 2711 is to provide for the substitution 
of timber for the canceled Elkhorn Ridge Timber Sale.

                  background and need for legislation

    In October 1987, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) sold 
3.8 million board feet of timber within the Elkhorn Ridge area 
in Mendocino County near Laytonville, California. As the result 
of a lawsuit filed with the Federal District Court in 1989 by 
the Sierra Club, the BLM reassessed the impacts of the sale on 
the area's wild and scenic river corridor, the northern spotted 
owl, marbled murrelet and the at-risk coho salmon, currently 
petitioned for Federal listing under the Endangered Species 
Act. Public comment received on two BLM environmental impact 
statements overwhelmingly recommended that the timber sale 
contract be terminated.
    The Elkhorn Ridge sale site lies within the South Fork Eel 
River Management Area, containing 17,200 acres of public lands 
in Mendocino County near the South Fork Eel River. The River 
has been identified as a ``Tier 1 Key Watershed'' in the 
President's Northwest Forest Plan. The purpose of the 
designation is to maintain existing native anadromous fish 
stocks until habitat conditions can be improved and to identify 
the watershed as having the highest potential and priority for 
restoration.
    Based on these considerations, the BLM signed a record of 
decision on May 27, 1994, stopping the harvest of the timber 
sale. Eel River Sawmills filed a claim under the Contract 
Disputes Act for resolution of the Elkhorn Ridge timber sale 
contract, seeking damages of $2.4 million. On October 21, 1994, 
BLM notified Eel River Sawmills that the contract was 
terminated. BLM offered a profit-only settlement which was 
rejected by Eel River.
    The BLM's preferred option in resolving the timber contract 
is to substitute timber from less environmentally sensitive 
areas in the region. BLM has identified three suitable sale 
areas which would be nearly equal in value to the Elkhorn 
timber sale. These are: Sheridan/Carr Creek near Weaverville; 
Powerline northwest of Deadwood; and Deadwood, between Deadwood 
and Lewiston; all in Trinity County, California. BLM's Regional 
and the Department of the Interior Solicitors have concurred in 
BLM's determination that such a substitute would be in the 
public interest and the most suitable resolution to this legal 
dispute.

                            committee action

    H.R. 2711 was introduced on December 5, 1995, by 
Congressman Frank Riggs (R-CA). The bill was referred to the 
Committee on Agriculture and additionally to the Committee on 
Resources. Within the Committee on Resources, the bill was 
referred to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and 
Lands. On May 30, 1996, the Subcommittee held a hearing on H.R. 
2711, where Mr. Matt Millenbach, Deputy Director of the BLM, 
testified in support of the legislation. On June 27, 1996, the 
Subcommittee met to mark up H.R. 2711. The bill was ordered 
favorably reported to the Full Committee by voice vote without 
amendment. On July 17, 1996, the Full Resources Committee met 
to consider H.R. 2711. The bill was ordered favorably reported 
to the House of Representatives by voice vote without amendment 
in the presence of a quorum.

                      section-by-section analysis

Section 1. Substitution of timber for canceled timber sale

    Section 1 authorizes the BLM to substitute, without 
competition, a contract for timber identified for harvest 
located on public lands administered by the BLM in the State of 
California of comparable value for the following terminated 
timber contract: Elkhorn Ridge Timber Sale, Contract No. CA-
050-TS-88-01. Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
change any law or policy beyond the specified timber sale 
substitution.

            committee oversight findings and recommendations

    With respect to the requirements of clause 2(l)(3) of rule 
XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, and clause 
2(b)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
the Committee on Resources' oversight findings and 
recommendations are reflected in the body of this report.

                     inflationary impact statement

    Pursuant to clause 2(l)(4) of rule XI of the Rules of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee estimates that the 
enactment of H.R. 2711 will have no significant inflationary 
impact on prices and costs in the operation of the national 
economy.

                        cost of the legislation

    Clause 7(a) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives requires an estimate and a comparison by the 
Committee of the costs which would be incurred in carrying out 
H.R. 2711. However, clause 7(d) of that rule provides that this 
requirement does not apply when the Committee has included in 
its report a timely submitted cost estimate of the bill 
prepared by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
under section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

                     compliance with house rule xi

    1. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(B) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, H.R. 
2711 does not contain any new budget authority, spending 
authority, credit authority, or an increase or decrease in tax 
expenditures. Enactment of H.R. 2711 would result in a loss of 
offsetting receipts to the Federal Government of approximately 
$2 million. However, the bill could also result in a savings to 
the Federal Government by eliminating the need to pay for the 
canceled timber contract.
    2. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(D) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, the 
Committee has received no report of oversight findings and 
recommendations from the Committee on Government Reform and 
Oversight on the subject of H.R. 2711.
    3. With respect to the requirement of clause 2(l)(3)(C) of 
rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives and 
section 403 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the 
Committee has received the following cost estimate for H.R. 
2711 from the Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE

                                     U.S. Congress,
                               Congressional Budget Office,
                                     Washington, DC, July 25, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources,
House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has 
reviewed H.R. 2711, a bill to provide for the substitution of 
timber for the canceled Elkhorn Ridge timber sale, as ordered 
reported by the House Committee on Resources on July 17, 1996. 
Enacting H.R. 2711 would affect offsetting receipts and thus 
direct spending; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would 
apply to the bill. We estimate that the increase in direct 
spending would total about $2 million over the 1997-2000 
period. Enacting this bill could also result in some savings to 
the federal government because it would eliminate the 
possibility that a court might order the government to pay 
compensation for canceling the Elkhorn Ridge timber sale. CBO 
cannot estimate the likelihood, extent, or timing of any such 
savings, but we expect that any potential savings would not be 
realized until after 1998.
    H.R. 2711 would authorize the Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM) to offer timber to Eel River Sawmills as a substitute for 
the canceled Elkhorn Ridge timber sale. In May 1994, BLM 
stopped the harvest of timber from that sale. That contract 
termination could result in court proceedings to determine 
whether the federal government is liable for paying 
compensation to Eel River Sawmills, which had been awarded the 
Elkhorn Ridge contract. The company and BLM have agreed to a 
settlement whereby the agency would offer the company 
substitute timber in exchange for the timber covered by the 
original Elkhorn Ridge contract. Enacting H.R. 2711 would allow 
BLM to fulfill that settlement agreement by awarding the 
substitute timber to Eel River Sawmills at no additional cost 
to the company.
    By authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to provide 
substitute timber that BLM would otherwise be likely to sell 
through competitive bidding, this bill would probably reduce 
offsetting receipts to the Treasury and thus increase federal 
outlays. According to BLM, the appraised value of the proposed 
substitute timber is about $2 million, which is the value that 
BLM would use to set the minimum bid in a competitive bidding 
process. Thus, selling the substitute timber would likely 
result in a winning bid of at least that amount. Therefore, CBO 
estimates that enacting H.R. 2711 would result in a loss of $2 
million in offsetting receipts over the 1997-2000 period, net 
of required payments to States.
    At the same time, enacting this bill could result in 
savings to the federal government--perhaps offsetting some or 
all of the costs identified above--by eliminating the need for 
compensation that a court might otherwise require the 
government to pay for canceling the Elkhorn Ridge contract. CBO 
cannot estimate the likelihood, magnitude, or timing of any 
such compensation. Based on information from BLM, CBO expects 
that any such savings would not be realized until after fiscal 
year 1998. Resolving the dispute through legislation also could 
reduce federal administrative costs by avoiding some litigation 
expenses.
    H.R. 2711 contains no private-sector or intergovernmental 
mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(Public Law 104-4). The state of California would receive 4 
percent of the receipts from timber sales affected by this 
bill. Because we estimate that the bill would result in lower 
receipts from the timber sales, we estimate that payments to 
the state would be reduced, but that any such reduction would 
be less than $100,000.
    If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be 
pleased to provide them. The staff contacts are Victoria V. 
Heid (for federal costs), and Marjorie Miller (for the state, 
local, and tribal impact).
            Sincerely,
                                         June E. O'Neill, Director.

                    COMPLIANCE WITH PUBLIC LAW 104-4

    H.R. 2711 contains no unfunded mandates.

                        CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW

    If enacted, H.R. 2711 would make no changes in existing 
law.
                            A P P E N D I X

                              ----------                              

                     U.S. House of Representatives,
                                  Committee on Agriculture,
                                     Washington, DC, July 24, 1996.
Hon. Don Young,
Chairman, Committee on Resources, Longworth House Office Building, 
        Washington, DC.
    Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for advising the Committee on 
Agriculture that on July 17, 1996, the Committee on Resources 
had ordered reported H.R. 2711, a bill to provide for the 
substitution of timber for the canceled Elkhorn Ridge Timber 
Sale. This Committee received primary referral of the bill.
    However, in the interest of time and the circumstances of 
this matter, this Committee has no objection to expediting 
consideration of H.R. 2711 by the full House without 
consideration by this Committee or its Subcommittee on Resource 
Conservation, Research, and Forestry by waiving consideration 
of the bill at this time. However, our waiver on consideration 
of H.R. 2711 should not be considered as precedent for any 
future referrals of similar measures relating to timber sale 
substitution. Moreover, if this bill or any similar bill is 
conferenced with the Senate, this Committee reserves the right 
to request to be included as conferees.
    As also your cooperation is appreciated.
            Sincerely,
                                             Pat Roberts, Chairman.
